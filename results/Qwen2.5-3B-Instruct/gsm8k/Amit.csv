"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet eats for breakfast. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs left after breakfast is:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Janet also bakes muffins with 4 eggs every day. So, the number of eggs left after baking muffins is:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These 9 eggs are the ones Janet sells at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required for the robe. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is:

\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Now, to find the total number of bolts required for the robe, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:

\[ \text{Total bolts} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh invests an additional $50,000 in repairs, so the total investment in the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value of the house gives us the new value:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost (initial house price + repair cost) from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is $70,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one day:**
   James runs 3 sprints each day, so the total meters he runs in one day is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/day} = 180 \text{ meters/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total meters he runs in one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses.

\[
\boxed{64}

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by determining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - (3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours) = 4 hours - 5.5 hours = -1.5 hours.
   - Since the time remaining is negative, it means he has already completed his journey.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 120 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{First month downloads} = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 70% of the downloads in the second month (since it reduced by 30%):
\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 93 = -82.5\) dollars.

Since the net profit is negative every year, Carlos will never start earning money from the lemon tree. The tree will always incur a loss.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{never}}

"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

\[ 2x = 36 \]

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by following the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:

4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

The final numerical answer is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

For the jewelry:
- Initial value: $5,000
- Market growth rate: 2.5% or 0.025
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value: $8,000
- Market growth rate: 1.2% or 0.012
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the two profits, the profit from purchasing the jewelry is higher at $125 compared to $96 from the electronic gadgets.

Therefore, the merchant should choose to purchase the jewelry to maximize profit. The profit from this choice is $125.

Final numerical answer:
125"

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual teaching earnings are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$20/\text{hour} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual coaching earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's do the calculations:

\[ 35 \times 50 \times 20 = 3500 \times 20 = 70000 \]
\[ 15 \times 50 \times 30 = 750 \times 30 = 22500 \]

Adding both earnings together gives her annual salary:
\[ 70000 + 22500 = 92500 \]

So, Jill's annual salary is $92,500."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks and then convert that into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire uses in one day:
- Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, Claire uses \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \).

Now, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, Claire uses \( 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
- \( 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozen} \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Let's denote the remaining distance as \(d\) miles. The remaining time she needs to hike this distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail is:
\[ \text{Total time required} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she needs is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find the speed \(v\) she needs to walk the remaining distance \(d\) in 1 hour. Since the remaining distance is:
\[ d = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]
The speed \(v\) is:
\[ v = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour. Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
  \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks:
\[
\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water remains the same, which is \(\frac{47}{3}\) liters. Therefore, the concentration of water in the remaining 9 liters of the mixture is:
\[
\frac{\frac{47}{3}}{9} = \frac{47}{27} \approx 1.74 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{27}}

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). Then we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

First, we know the total distance of Henry's trip is 60 miles. His first stop was after he had traveled 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which means it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:
\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, the total time spent on one dog per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

jewels.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 23 \]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Therefore, the total points Mike scores are the sum of the points from both periods:

Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
Total points = 4 + 5 = 9 points

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To solve this, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats over 30 days and then calculate the cost based on the sale price.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to get 60 yogurts, we divide 60 by 4:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times $5.00/\text{set} = $75.00 \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money John has left after buying the video games. He started with $195 and spent $160.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after his purchases, so the remaining money is:

\[
35 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the remaining money ($30) is less than the amount he spent on the video games ($160), it confirms that he indeed has $5 left after the purchases.

John started with 13 lego sets and has no lego sets left after selling them. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To find John's running speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. To find his average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's breath can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in a single serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can confirm that each serving indeed contains 250 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings as follows:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \]

Since each serving is 250 grams, the amount of chips you can eat is:

\[ \text{Amount of chips} = 0.8 \times 250 = 200 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200 grams."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of making the candles:
- Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax.
- He needs to make 20 candles.
- Therefore, he needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.
- The cost of one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
- So, the total cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:
- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- He sells 20 candles.
- Therefore, the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

The final numerical answer is:
$20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).
3. After purchasing the package, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which used up \( x \) post-it notes.
4. After placing the post-it notes on the coffee cups, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ 80 - x + 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 220 + 80 - x = 23 \]
\[ 300 - x = 23 \]
\[ 300 - 23 = x \]
\[ x = 277 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 277.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 277 \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building:

- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.

So, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied:

\[ \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"

Total earnings per week: 147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, the final numerical answer is $294."
"To solve this, we need to know the distance Tom traveled to get from 1 to 4 PM. Since the speed is given as 10 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM), the distance can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 mph. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. 

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the day with the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday separately.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360

- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

The final numerical answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens from each cat and then sum them up.

First, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens. 

Next, we are told that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we calculate the number of Patchy's kittens as follows:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of Patchy's kittens:
\[ 7 + 21 = 28 \]

Finally, we add the number of Trixie's kittens to the total from Patchy and the adopted kittens:
\[ 28 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- One orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \text{ unripe oranges} \]

Next, we know there is 1 bad orange and 2 sour oranges. Let's add these up:
\[ 1 \text{ bad} + 2 \text{ sour} + 5 \text{ unripe} = 8 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, subtract the number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges from the total to find the number of good oranges:
\[ 25 \text{ total} - 8 \text{ unripe, bad, and sour} = 17 \text{ good oranges} \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is $50,000/year.

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension for the first 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - The total pension for the next 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.
   - Therefore, her total pension after 30 years is $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000.

4. **Annual pension after 30 years:**
   - Since she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years, her annual pension after 30 years will be 5% of $1,500,000.
   - 5% of $1,500,000 = 0.05 * $1,500,000 = $75,000.

Thus, her annual pension after 30 years will be $75,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - Aleena pays the full monthly rate of $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Total payment for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming company charges 10% less than the full monthly rate.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly rate is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total payment for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Payment for the Year:**
   - Sum of the payments for both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \( 1596 \) dollars."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. 

Given that her tank holds 12 gallons and she has used 4 gallons, she has \(12 - 4 = 8\) gallons left in her tank.

Since she has already driven 100 miles with 4 gallons, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) her car gets. 

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 8 gallons, we multiply the number of gallons left by the miles per gallon:

\[ \text{Miles on remaining gas} = 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles she has already driven to the miles she can drive with the remaining gas:

\[ \text{Total miles} = 100 \text{ miles} + 200 \text{ miles} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas. 

The final numerical answer is 300."

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the interest on the total cost.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

Let's start with step 1:

The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five cell phones.
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750

Next, step 2:

The interest rate is 2% per unit.
Interest on one cell phone = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3
Total interest for five cell phones = 5 * $3 = $15

Now, step 3:

Total amount to be paid = Total cost before interest + Total interest
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765

Finally, step 4:

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3.
Amount to be paid each month = $765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- Level 1: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet.
- Level 2: 4 square feet.
- Level 3: 8 square feet.
- Level 4: 16 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year:
- The puppy will live for the rest of its life, and we need to determine how much dog food is required for the remaining days in the first year.
- There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days remaining in the first year is:
  \[
  365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days}
  \]
- The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
  \[
  2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Now, add the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:
\[
180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}
\]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use:
- Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- The number of bags required is:
  \[
  \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags}

"First, let's determine how much laundry Sarah does. According to the problem, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we calculate how much laundry Sarah does in terms of David's laundry. The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4:

\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference in cost is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age = A
- Jackson's age = J
- Corey's age = C
- James's age = 10

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, we can solve for Corey's age using the third relationship:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age is 11, we can use the second relationship to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Using the first relationship, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = \(120 - 80 = 40\)

The final numerical answer is 40."
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \).

\[

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

She receives 18 more potted plants from her nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is 58."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing up the rings from each friend:

Total doorbell rings = First friend's rings + Second friend's rings + Third friend's rings + Fourth friend's rings
Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60

Let's calculate the sum:
Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

So, the final numerical answer is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first add up all the pages from his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading after reading 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages he needs to read in the remaining 4 days is:

39 pages (total) - 15 pages (read on Monday) = 24 pages

To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day over the next 4 days, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages/day

So, the final numerical answer is 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday). Since he drinks one glass of water with each meal, and he has three meals a day, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays. Therefore, for 5 weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he drinks 0 glasses of water on each of the two weekend days. Therefore, for 2 weekend days, he drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 0 \text{ glasses} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to cover 42 miles.

First, we find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time required to cover all 14 segments is:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy places her pieces**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after mom places her pieces**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is then:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 3 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 such boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 \text{ cubic inches} = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 108 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute show, totaling 1.5 hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's add up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (total)} - 5.5 \text{ hours (Monday to Friday)} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x = x + 15 \). This gives us the equation:

\[ 2x = x + 15 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 2x - x = 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies. But he actually baked \( 2x = 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

But the problem states that he now has a total of 110 cookies. This discrepancy suggests that the 15 extra cookies he baked were not the only factor, and there might be an additional context or misunderstanding. However, based on the given information and the logical steps, the number of cookies Henry meant to bake last year is:

"To calculate the final cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the cost would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback reward. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the cashback would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount after the cashback rewards:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final amount after the cashback rewards is:

\[ \$28.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

Marcell's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total: \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total: \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total: \(42 + 48 = 90\) roll-ups

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we divide the total by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average: \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\) roll-ups

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

However, we need to calculate the amount of water the boat took on during this time. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be written as:
\[ B = 50D \]

We already found that \( B = 300 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \( D = 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

So, the total cost of the lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the same price: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the same price: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

So, the total revenue from selling the lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = 0 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the total amount used is the sum of the teaspoons of sugar and the cups of water, which is given as 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now that we have \(x = 6\), we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is \(7x\), we substitute \(x\) with 6:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

\[\boxed{42}\]"

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we can break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost incurred.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
- Therefore, the revenue per patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day:
- The total revenue per day is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Therefore, the cost per patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day:
- The total cost per day is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- The profit per day is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, the number of elves who quit is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \). This leaves \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) elves.
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. This leaves \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

Let's start with the first step:

- Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:

- Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = Miles on Monday + Miles on Tuesday = \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles.

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. So, to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:

- Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles from Monday to Wednesday - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we can use the following steps:

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete on the first test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete on the second test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Finally, we sum the incomplete questions from both tests to get the total number of questions Mark left incomplete:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ 20\% \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"

"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps, with costs of 3 dollars and 4 dollars respectively. The tax rate is 10%.

First, calculate the tax for the light bulbs:
\[ \text{Tax on light bulbs} = 3 \times \frac{10}{100} = 0.30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the tax for the roach traps:
\[ \text{Tax on roach traps} = 4 \times \frac{10}{100} = 0.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, add the tax to the original cost of each nonfood item:
\[ \text{Total cost for light bulbs} = 3 + 0.30 = 3.30 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for roach traps} = 4 + 0.40 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of milk, eggs, and cups are all food items, so they are not taxed. Their total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost for milk, eggs, and cups} = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the total costs of the food items and the nonfood items to get the final total cost:

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the cost for each client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare in a year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, in a year (which has 12 months), he can harvest pineapples 12 / 3 = 4 times.

Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare, in one year, John can harvest 100 * 4 = 400 pineapples per hectare.

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is 400 * 10 = 4000 pineapples.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 4000."
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125. 

The final numerical answer is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, so the hive had 0 bees. After 15 bees returned, the hive had 15 bees. After 60 bees left, the hive had \( 15 - 60 = -45 \) bees. Since the hive cannot have a negative number of bees, this means all the bees that returned and some more left, resulting in a net loss of 45 bees. So, the hive had \( 15 - 60 = -45 \) bees, which means the hive is empty and 45 bees are missing.

5. **Bee population at the end of the last 6 hours:** All the bees that left before this period return to the hive. Since 45 bees are missing, the hive will have 45 bees return to it.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

The final numerical answer is:
45"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the total amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So we set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is 4 minutes."
"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost for each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

For the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents.

For the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents.

For the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, so 1 tire * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents.

Now, we sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- Total cost in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants ate one final fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours he spends each day and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total hours per day on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total hours per day on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total hours per week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours spent attending classes in one semester is:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet/baguette} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches/baguette}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[32\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after each two-month period, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

After the first two months, the price increases by 20% of $20:
\[ \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

After the next two months (4 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8 \]

After the next two months (6 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56 \]

After the next two months (8 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472 \]

After the next two months (10 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664 \]

After the next two months (12 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968 \]

After the next two months (14 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 59.71968 \times \frac{20}{100} = 11.943936 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 59.71968 + 11.943936 = 71.663616 \]

After the next two months (16 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 71.663616 \times \frac{20}{100} = 14.3327232 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 71.663616 + 14.3327232 = 85.9963392 \]

After the next two months (18 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 85.9963392 \times \frac{20}{100} = 17.19926784 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 85.9963392 + 17.19926784 = 103.19560704 \]

After the next two months (20 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 103.19560704 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20.639121408 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 103.19560704 + 20.639121408 = 123.834728448 \]

After the next two months (22 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 123.834728448 \times \frac{20}{100} = 24.7669456896 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 123.834728448 + 24.7669456896 = 148.6016741376 \]

After the next two months (24 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:

\[ \text{New Price} = 148.6016741376 + 29.72033482752 = 178.32200896512 \]

After the next two months (26 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 178.32200896512 \times \frac{20}{100} = 35.664401793024 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 178.32200896512 + 35.664401793024 = 213.986410758144 \]

After the next two months (28 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:

\[ \text{New Price} = 213.986410758144 + 42.7972821516288 = 256.7836929097728 \]

After the next two months (30 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 256.7836929097728 \times \frac{20}{100} = 51.35673858195456 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 256.7836929097728 + 51.35673858195456 = 308.14043149172736 \]

After the next two months (32 months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 308.14043149172736 \times \frac{20}{100} = 61.628086298345472 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $532.47."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. 

Missed income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will pay $90 for the service. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $90 less than the $105 she would have lost by doing her taxes herself. 

So, the amount of money she will have more if she hires the accountant is:

$105 - $90 = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, for 15 flans, she will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age \( S \):
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. 

First, we calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has: 
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance, taking into account that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders with 8 legs each:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects with 6 legs each:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum up the total legs from all the groups:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato. 

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

To add these times together, we need to convert the time to cut one potato into minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equal to \( \frac{5}{60} = \frac{1}{12} \) minutes.

So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is:
\[ 1.5 + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{18}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{19}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Billy to peel and cut 60 potatoes. Since it takes \(\frac{19}{12}\) minutes to prepare one potato, it will take:
\[ 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 5 \times 19 = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$10 - \$25 = -\$15 \]

This negative cost indicates that the cost is actually $15, not $25. This means the cost of making the lemonade is $15. The cost of making the lemonade includes the cost of lemons and sugar. Let's denote the cost of lemons as \( L \) and the cost of sugar as \( S \). We know:
\[ L + S = \$15 \]
\[ L = \$3 \]
\[ S = \$2 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's calculate Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

According to the problem, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:

"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the faster team:
Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds, and there are four members.
Total time for the faster team = 4 members * 55 seconds/member = 220 seconds.

For the slower team:
The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third).
Total time for the slower team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, we calculate the difference in time between the slower team and the faster team:
Difference in time = 222 seconds (slower team) - 220 seconds (faster team) = 2 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( n \).

The cost of buying the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars.
The cost of transporting the wheat is \( 2n \) dollars.
So, the total cost for the trader is \( 20n + 2n = 22n \) dollars.

The trader sold all the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue from selling the wheat is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends:

- Cost of tickets: $20.25
- Cost of food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
- Cost of rides: $33 * 2 = $66

Total amount spent = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total amount spent = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Now, they agreed to split all the costs evenly. So, each person paid:

Each person's share = Total amount spent / 3
Each person's share = $102 / 3 = $34

The final numerical answer is $34."

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:

\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:

\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: We are considering 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees added over 10 years:
\[
8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
\]

Next, add the trees added over 10 years to the initial number of trees:
\[
50 \text{ trees} + 80 \text{ trees} = 130 \text{ trees}
\]

Now, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. Calculate 30% of 130 trees:
\[
0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
\]

Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
\[
130 \text{ trees} - 39 \text{ trees} = 91 \text{ trees}
\]

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Saturday morning:**
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

4. **On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - Total number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)

5. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - Number of white flamingos is the same as the number of flamingos taken back and painted white, which is 6.

6. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds."
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up with her initial number of cards.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **Cards collected in the first month**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
3. **Cards collected in the second month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
4. **Cards collected in the third month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"

"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's original weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate the total salary increase for the entire year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- The total raise for the year is \( 100 \times 52 = 5200 \) dollars.

Now, we add the monetary reward from the award to the total raise:
- The monetary reward is $5000.
- The total reward amount is \( 5000 + 5200 = 10200 \) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total amount John made that year by adding the total reward to his total salary:
- John's total salary for the year is \( 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \) dollars.
- The total amount John made that year is \( 104000 + 10200 = 114200 \) dollars.

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total cheese slices for the macaroni and cheese dish = 8 slices.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let's denote this score as \( x \). The sum of all six test scores should be 558:

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts to solve it step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - $1200 less than this is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of each cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Twenty dozen is 240 cups (since 20 x 12 = 240).
   - Therefore, the cost of each cup is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

The total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the money she already has from the total cost:
- The total cost is $70, and she already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Now, we need to determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per mowing:
- $60 / $4 = 15.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

Given \( B = 4S \) and \( B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \):
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify:
4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the setup again. The correct interpretation should be:
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Janeth's remaining balance will be after 12 months. We subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[
\text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Now, determine their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points scored by all four students to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

\[
\boxed{70}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers he plants is 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers. 

The final numerical answer is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount:

\[ \text{Amount spent on advertising in the second year} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total:

\[ \text{Total amount spent on advertising} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20000 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then add the two amounts together.

- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos = $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji = $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

So, the final numerical answer is $180."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider the time it takes for each part of his trip.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester, the travel time by car is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total travel time will be the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip:
\[ 6 \text{ days (bus to Rochester)} + 3 \text{ days (car from Rochester)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the total number of cards is:
- Total cards: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito before any upgrades or discounts:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Now, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink, so we add that to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is $9.00."
"First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Watermelons ready after first two months} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. This means the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest is:

\[ \text{Remaining watermelons} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. According to the problem, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Watermelons ready after two weeks} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the second two weeks. Consequently, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \text{Watermelons not ready} = 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars:

\[ 20,000 \times 12 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the original cost of the cars:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the total registration fee for all 12 cars. Each car's registration fee is $1,000:

\[ 1,000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the cars with tax to the total registration fee:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ 276,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday, Kylie collects \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

2. Calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. Now, subtract the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 12 = 12
   \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's determine how much Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, in a week (7 days) he eats:

\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{2} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, they eat:

\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to get 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. 

First, Ram buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, he can make:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

new pens from the 25 empty pens he initially bought. After using these 25 pens to make 5 new pens, he now has 5 new pens plus the 5 empty pens he used to make them, which totals to:

\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

empty pens. Now, he can use these 10 empty pens to make another 2 new pens (since he needs 5 pens to make one new pen):

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

new pens. After using these 10 pens to make 2 new pens, he now has 2 new pens plus the 2 empty pens he used to make them, which totals to:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]

empty pens. Now, he can use these 4 empty pens to make another 0.8 new pens, but since he can only make whole pens, he can only make 0 new pens from these 4 empty pens.

So, the total number of pens Ram has now is the 2 new pens he made from the first batch plus the 2 new pens he made from the second batch, which is:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

After students went through exit B, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 280 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his calls with his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes with other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write the equation as:

\[ |4 - 32| = 2F \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 2F \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for Jean during the movie:

- She requires makeup done 4 times a week.
- Each session takes 6 hours.
- The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 4 sessions/week * 6 hours/session * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

So, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:

Final amount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $27,000."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Each cookie has 200 calories.

Total calories consumed by Sue:
- \(46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\)

Total calories consumed by Sue's sister:
- \(18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\)

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Difference in calories:
- \(9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories}\)

The final numerical answer is:

First, we know from the problem that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night. From last night, we know he killed 15 cougars. Therefore, today he killed:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

Since today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, he killed:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

So, the total number of animals killed today is:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

Adding the animals killed last night and today, the total number of animals killed is:
\[ 25 \text{ animals} + 48 \text{ animals} = 73 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 73 \]"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find the floor he ends up on, we calculate: \(4 \times 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18\).

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he has now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum them up.

- Pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00
- Nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00
- Dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.00
- Dollar bills: 40 pieces * $1.00/piece = $40.00

Adding these values together gives us the total amount of money:

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, let's determine the total length of the redwood tree in 10-foot sections:

\[ \text{Total length of the redwood tree} = 200 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Length of each section} = 10 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage:

\[ \text{Weight per section} = 400 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites, which ate 30% of the wood:

\[ \text{Percentage of wood eaten by termites} = 30\% = 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we calculate the remaining weight of the redwood tree:

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the total cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book overdue, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6.00 \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ A_a = 52 \]

From this, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so:

\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:

\[ A_f = A_a + A_b \]
\[ A_f = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

And the total number of fruits Jamal has:

\[ J_f = J_a + J_b \]
\[ J_f = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together is:

\[ A_f + J_f = 76 + 92 = 168 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla plans to make 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \text{Cups of flour needed} = \left( \frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \right) \times 2 \text{ cups} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

Then, multiplying by 2 cups:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need:
\[ \boxed{11} \text{ cups of flour} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is $62."
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles each, which totals to \(5 \times 50 = 250\) marbles. After getting 20 more marbles from her friend, she has \(250 + 20 = 270\) marbles.

"First, let's determine the number of trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees Harry has} - \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total fees Mr. Tan paid. This includes the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees from the selling price and then subtract the loan amount.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. The additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that the time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Thus, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the cooking time:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 51 \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the number of golf balls. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls and half of these are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
Number of golf balls = 16 / 2
Number of golf balls = 8

Now, we know that half of these golf balls are blue. Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is:

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
Number of blue golf balls = 8 / 2
Number of blue golf balls = 4

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

1. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the collar, rosette, and body of the sweater from the total gives us the stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 - 900 = 630
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene. Therefore, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, we calculate the number of cards that had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

We then find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cards that had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter C:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's determine the number of spots for a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding the total spots for the cobras and mambas gives us the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads.

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up the totals for all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"If Ann is 9 years old, her brother is twice her age, which means her brother is \(9 \times 2 = 18\) years old. In 3 years, her brother will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

"Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equal to 5 * 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equal to 2 * 10 = 20 cents. Therefore, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is 145 - 55 = 90 cents. 

The final numerical answer is 90."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars.

The total number of stars is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. So, the number of stars in these rows is:

\[3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36\]

Subtracting the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars gives us the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each of these rows has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula for time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. This is \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.
3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. So, the total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The number of chocolate bars for the adults is 24.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left for the children is \(40 - 24 = 16\).

Finally, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 8 children.
- Therefore, each child will get \(16 \div 8 = 2\) chocolate bars.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \left(\frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.
3. Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20 points, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so Tony gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.**

- Mike's new points: \(21 + 1 = 22\)
- Jim's new points: \(18\) (no extra point)
- Tony's new points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

Now, we sum the points of all three players:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The total points all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total number of activities he does in the two days.

For the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

For the second day:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Adding these up for the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 \]

Adding these up for the second day:
\[ 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 \]

Adding the totals from both days:
\[ 170 + 200 = 370 \]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the 5 members of the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the 5 members of the household. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \times 2 = 0.4\) kg of rice per day. For 5 people, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 0.4 \times 5 = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

Let's denote the initial bid as $200. The bids increase by $50 each time, and Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people. Therefore, the bids made by the other 3 people are $200, $250, and $300. Carmen's bids will be $350, $400, and $450, since she bids after each of the other 3 people.

Now, let's sum up all the bids:
- The first person's bid: $200
- The second person's bid: $250
- The third person's bid: $300
- Carmen's first bid: $350
- Carmen's second bid: $400
- Carmen's third bid: $450

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 450 \]

We can group and add them step by step:
\[ (200 + 450) + (250 + 400) + (300 + 350) = 650 + 650 + 650 = 1950 \]

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost per mile driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year. John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven in a year is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. The cost is $2 per mile, so:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30000 \text{ per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver in a year. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1800 \text{ per year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
\[ \$30000 + \$1800 = \$31800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$31800 \]"

"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage:
- Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week.
- He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are \(50 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500\).

Next, we add the weekly bonus:
- He gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
- Therefore, his total weekly earnings are \( \$500 + \$300 = \$800 \).

Now, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and assuming the company performed well every week, we need to calculate his earnings for 4 full weeks and the first 2 days of the 5th week.

- For 4 full weeks, his earnings are \(4 \times \$800 = \$3200\).
- For the first 2 days of the 5th week, he works \(2 \times 10 = 20\) hours.
- His earnings for these 2 days are \(20 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$200\).

Adding these together, his total earnings for April are \( \$3200 + \$200 = \$3400 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3400}

"First, let's calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we have:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight Sandy needs to lose in 4 weeks is 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing the total days by the growth interval for an arm:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing the total days by the growth interval for a leg:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Total expenses = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he has available for the trip is:
Total available = $6000 (initial amount) - $2000 (to be saved) = $4000

Now, we can calculate how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total available - Total expenses
Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, the final numerical answer is $2050."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Calculate Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\). Then, six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 / 4 = 2\).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the ones he bought from Johanna to the ones already in the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add these 8 marbles to the 70 marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 156 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people in total left, and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women (10 total - 3 men = 7 women).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 7.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Adding the 46 pencils that Meg has, we get the total number of pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, we need to consider that each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effect of the cooling and the added liquid separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we need to determine how many ice cubes are equivalent to cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. We do this by dividing 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, cooling the coffee by 65 degrees is equivalent to using 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so using 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much weaker the total volume is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ 60 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"

3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the $8 rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards.
   - Since the rewards used were $8, the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - After applying the $16 coupon, the final cost becomes $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine which job Nick should choose, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before property tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Net income tax rate: 10%
- Net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job.

The final numerical answer is $8,400."

1. Determine how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice.
2. Calculate the total distance he runs in a month.
3. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since he currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance he needs to run is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson runs is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance he runs in June is:

"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors when they made tractors:

Daily earnings from tractors = Number of tractors sold per day * Price per tractor
Daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor
Daily earnings from tractors = $1000/day

Now, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos now that they make silos:

Daily earnings from silos = Number of silos sold per day * Price per silo
Daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo
Daily earnings from silos = $1100/day

To find out what percentage more they are making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:

Percentage increase = (New value - Original value) / Original value * 100%

Substituting the values:

Percentage increase = ($1100/day - $1000/day) / $1000/day * 100%
Percentage increase = $100/day / $1000/day * 100%
Percentage increase = 0.1 * 100%
Percentage increase = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors."

2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga class, which is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours

Now, we sum up the durations of all the activities:
\[ 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \]

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of plant pots needed for the daisies and roses.

For the daisies, the school needs 30 plant pots.
For the roses, they need twice as many as the daisies, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots needed is \(30 + 60 = 90\).

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought:

\(100 - 90 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is 10."
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave her brother $4. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she saved.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( S \):
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 = 21 \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \( 21 \).

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 + 3 = 9 hours

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.

Total time for shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The shows account for 30% of the total time he spent. Let's denote the total time he spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 6 hours:
\[ 0.30 \times T = 6 \]
\[ T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total time \( T \) is 20 hours. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Time spent sightseeing: 40% of 20 hours
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

- Dean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2, so the total cost for the toy cars is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- Dean bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1, so the total cost for the teddy bears is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost of the toys:
\[12 + 5 = 17\] dollars.

Dean initially had $28, and after buying the toys, he had:
\[28 - 17 = 11\] dollars left.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so Dean's total money becomes:
\[11 + 10 = 21\] dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts rides:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for these activities is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens:

- Budgeted amount: $90
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens: $90 - $25 = $65

Since each friend (including Morgan) gets $5 worth of arcade tokens, we can find out how many friends can be invited by dividing the remaining money by the cost per friend:

- Cost per friend for arcade tokens: $5
- Money left for arcade tokens: $65

Number of friends (including Morgan) that can be invited: $65 / $5 = 13

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends (since we are not including herself in the count of friends).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, let's determine how much pocket money Marisa receives each day. She gets $5 every day from her parents.

Now, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves each day by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by 5:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]

Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

The total amount spent on gumballs is $2. Therefore, the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is 5.3333 pounds. Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

5.3333"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third and back to first) is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to determine how many miles the train travels before needing service. The train needs service every 18,000 miles.

We divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles/service = 0.0375 service intervals/day.

Since the train needs service every 18,000 miles, the number of days between services is:
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.6667 days.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is 27."
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ \text{Total detour distance} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Detour distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to return home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total trip duration:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time for detour} + \text{Time to return home} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7} \text{ hours}} \]"

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on her third test. The equation for the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters \( y \) is:
\[ y = 4x - 5 \]
Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation:
\[ y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, the number of people kicked out for physical violence \( z \) is:
\[ z = 3y \]
Substituting \( y = 7 \) into the equation:
\[ z = 3(7) = 21 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as \( w \). According to the problem, the total number of people kicked out is 50. Therefore:
\[ x + y + z + w = 50 \]
Substituting the known values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \):
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + w = 50 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 31 + w = 50 \]
Solving for \( w \):

Millie sells all of the lemonade, so the profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours the lemonade stand is open to sell all 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is made up of 52 members and 50% are girls, the remaining 50% must be boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

So, the choir has 26 girls and 26 boys. When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we first need to determine how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. We know that he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since Ms. Thompson receives 66 messages, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David spends $30 on the ride bracelet.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. Therefore, Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha spends 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36 on tickets.

Now, let's compare the total costs for both David and Dasha. David spends $30, and Dasha spends $36. The difference in their costs is $36 - $30 = $6. This means David saves $6 by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has 12 gifts in total.

Next, we need to divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). The sum of these quantities is given by:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now we can find the number of popsicles each has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will get:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. So, the savings per month for Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $10, which is $2.
- Therefore, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount is $10 - $2 = $8 per month each.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the streaming services:

- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total monthly cost for streaming services = $10 + $8 + $8 = $26.

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. By cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Next, we'll calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Now, we'll calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of slots in the shelving system. Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To find out how much energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the usage of the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the energy consumption per hour in kilowatts is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \]

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
\[ 2.7 \text{ kW} \cdot \text{hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatt-hours of energy saved in 30 days is 81 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each, so \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes.

Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33 \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is approximately 29.33. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100
   \]
3. **Initial number of corns**: The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Since initially there are 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60
   \]
5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis**: Now we add the new number of corns and cannolis together:
   \[
   60 + 100 = 160
   \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets, so the cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, we can calculate the number of dangerous candles as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Since 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect, the remaining 4.9% of the dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Therefore, the number of dangerous candles that also smell like wet dog is:

\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 2,500 \times 0.049 = 122.5 \]

Since the number of candles must be a whole number, we round 122.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 122.

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
- Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- Total distance for the first 4 days = \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
- Distance traveled in the next 2 days = \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

Then, Tom didn't travel at all on the third day of the second week.

For the remaining 3 days of the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day:
- Distance traveled in the last 3 days = \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 900 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the third week.
- Total distance = \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 900 \text{ km} = 1940 \text{ km} \).

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 1940 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is $14 per month.
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$112 = \$184

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's verify the savings from each type of jeans. The savings from the tattered jeans is $4, and the cost of the tattered jeans is $28, so the savings per dollar spent on tattered jeans is:

\[ \frac{4}{28} = \frac{1}{7} \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the cost of the jogger jeans is $22, so the savings per dollar spent on jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{2}{22} = \frac{1}{11} \]

The difference in the original cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum up the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]

"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds, the feeders she made herself attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

Therefore, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the birds attracted by the feeders she made herself. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 + 3 \times 30 = 60 + 90 = 150 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 150."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

To find 25% of $4, we calculate:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cake costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = x \]

We know that after selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash. The remaining amount from selling the cards is:
\[ x - 50 \]

Since the total amount he earns from selling the cards is equal to the amount he has left after spending $50, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = x - 50 + 50 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = x \]

To find the total number of cards \( x \), we need to consider the total earnings from selling the cards. Since he earns $1.5 for each card sold, and he has $50 left after spending $50, the total earnings from selling the cards must be $100. Therefore:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 100 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times \frac{3}{2} = 100 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. There were 36 guests, and he prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs each. Therefore, the caterer prepared:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer needed to provide:

\[ 40 \text{ hotdogs} \]

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this half, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's determine the number of dragons slain by each prince.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur is:
\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter is:
\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5. To find out how much money he spent, we calculate 99% of $5:

\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars. We know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 3 bags of chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

This means George spent $1.20 on chips. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

So, George spent $3.75 on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before the time Wayne leaves. Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 - 5 = -1 \text{ minutes} \]

Since leaving 1 minute before Wayne would still mean she arrives 5 minutes before him, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width as follows:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven being on for 3 hours. Since the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, the total increase in temperature is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after 3 hours of baking is:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the temperature decrease due to the window being open for 30 minutes. The window causes a 2-degree decrease for every 10 minutes it is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature of the house after the window is opened for 30 minutes is:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature of the house is:

\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]

"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to run is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining number of sneakers sold to the department store is:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The department store bought these 31 sneakers for $25 each.

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both sales:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we can calculate the total from the two types of packets separately and then add them together.

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of crayon pieces:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 112."
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This can be expressed as:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the original cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use the new cost per balloon to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

   - Total cost for 20 balloons = $900
   - Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20 = $45

2. **Calculate the new cost per balloon:**
   - New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + $20 = $45 + $20 = $65

3. **Calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - Cost for 170 balloons = 170 * $65 = $11050

So, the final numerical answer is $11050."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

For the first part of the trip:
- Speed = 60 mph
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip:
- Speed = 30 mph
- Time = 1 hour
- Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna initially has 8 sapphires, and she trades 3 of them. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies she receives. Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:
\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"

60% of 15 red cards is:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the red, green, and yellow cards together:
\[ 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. So, after 20 minutes, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \). Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feeds to find the total weight of the feed:
\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Since 2250 pounds is exactly half of 4500 pounds, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Both players can store up to 100 songs.

\[ \text{Number of songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]
\[ \text{Number of songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel.

\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.
2. Determine the total amount of money given up based on the number of oranges eaten.

First, we find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges picked, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money given up is:
\[
\text{Total amount of money given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. This means for every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack:

- The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 packs with the offer is $4.00.

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon:

- The total cost after applying the coupon is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost per individual razor. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

Finally, to find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:

- The cost per razor is \(\frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25\) dollars.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

- \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 25 cents."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. 

The human pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on top of the 4, and 2 girls on top of the 3. The shortest girl is at the top, which means she is 60"" tall.

Let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:

1. The 4 girls on the bottom layer are each 64"" tall, so their total height is \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.
2. The 3 girls on the second layer are each 64"" tall, so their total height is \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches.
3. The 2 girls on the third layer are each 64"" tall, so their total height is \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches.
4. The top girl is 60"" tall.

Adding these together gives the total height of the pyramid in inches:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."

Over 5 days, the total minutes she walks is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this, let's first establish the current age of Brett and then use the information given to find Angela's current age.

Brett is currently 14 years old.

In four years, Brett's age will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years Angela will be:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age can be calculated by subtracting 4 from 42:
\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during the two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides Paul took each day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, each day, Paul took a total of:
\[ 1 \text{ (morning)} + 1 \text{ (afternoon)} = 2 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides over the 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

"Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 25n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 25:
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the question states the farm has 15 sheep, which seems to be a discrepancy with the given information about the zoo having 20 sheep). 

The zoo has 20 cows and 20 sheep (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the question states the zoo has 20 cows, which again seems to be a discrepancy with the given information about the farm having 30 cows).

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and sheep from both the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals
Zoo: 20 cows + 20 sheep = 40 animals

Combined: 45 animals (farm) + 40 animals (zoo) = 85 animals

The final numerical answer is 85."

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies Josh made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, the number of cookies Kelsie made is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time to minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first calculate double the time Rob takes:

\[ 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the additional 40 minutes:

\[ 240 + 40 = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren:

- Hats: 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks

Next, we calculate the number of skeins required for each item:

- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up the total number of skeins required:

6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour by all four is:
\[ 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \]

"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Given that he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we can calculate the number of rows of red tulips as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. Given that he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we can calculate the number of rows of blue tulips as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total number of rows} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device.

First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour.

Next, let's calculate her daily consumption after adding the new device:
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Weekly consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts.
- Weekly consumption after adding the new device: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts.

Next, let's calculate the cost of electricity for a week:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50.
- Weekly cost before adding the new device: 84 kilowatts * $1.50 = $126.
- Weekly cost after adding the new device: 98 kilowatts * $1.50 = $147.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints the house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is 1/10 of the house. Therefore, the rate of one person is 1/10 of the house per day.

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of the house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours for 5 people to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off (which is 21). So, the number of people who get on is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 in 8 years, which means:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

So, Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of the two is:

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( C = 1100 \)
3. \( P = C - 400 \)

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the third equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substituting the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's denote the number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. This means if he saves \( x \) dollars per day in the first half, he will save \( 2x \) dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month can be expressed as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half has 15 days.

The total savings for the month is given by:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 for each day in the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he has to save:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is $7.00."

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy before the discount, then apply the 10% discount, and finally sum up the discounted prices.

1. **Cost of notebooks:**
   - Price per notebook: $1.50
   - Number of notebooks: 5
   - Total cost for notebooks: \( 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \)

2. **Cost of pens:**
   - Price per pen: $0.25
   - Number of pens: 2
   - Total cost for pens: \( 0.25 \times 2 = 0.50 \)

3. **Cost of the calculator:**
   - Price of calculator: $12
   - Number of calculators: 1
   - Total cost for calculator: \( 12 \)

4. **Cost of the geometry set:**
   - Price of geometry set: $10
   - Number of geometry sets: 1
   - Total cost for geometry set: \( 10 \)

Now, we sum up the total cost before the discount:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.10 \times 20.00 = 2.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 20.00 - 2.00 = 18.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered:

- Five hamburgers at $4 each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars
- Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars
- Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\[20 + 3 + 10 = 33\] dollars

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars

The final numerical answer is 17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. Commission for the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 30\% \times \$1000 = 0.30 \times \$1000 = \$300 \]

2. Commission for the amount over $1000:
\[ \text{Amount over } \$1000 = \$2500 - \$1000 = \$1500 \]
\[ \text{Additional commission for } \$1500 = 10\% \times \$1500 = 0.10 \times \$1500 = \$150 \]

3. Total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

So, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has:

He started with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:
\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of water Bill needs for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles:
\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs:
\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water.

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, we calculate twice the time in cold water and then add 2 minutes:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

In cold water, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

In warm water, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost of the lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.

First, calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have two holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have four holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact number of cups, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. But if we assume \( R = 4 \) (which would mean the daily recommendation is 4 cups), then Juan would need to reduce his intake by \( 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

Therefore, the reduction in Juan's coffee intake is 16 cups. 

\[

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at the top of the pyramid.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) degrees upward from the pyramid.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
   - The sun moves 50 degrees upward from the pyramid.
   - Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is \( 32 + 50 = 82 \) degrees.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs to buy. 

The ages of the sons are 12 and 4. The difference in their ages is 12 - 4 = 8 years. This means James needs 8 candles for his sons.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 8 ÷ 5 = 1.6 packs. Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 2 packs to have enough candles.

Now, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 2 packs × $3/pack = $6.

So, James spends $6 on candles.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To solve this, let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for these three teeth, she received $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of money per tooth as she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. So, for these two teeth, she received $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we sum up all the money Sharon received:
- For the first tooth: $5.00
- For the next three teeth: $3.00
- For the last two teeth: $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

"First, let's calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) and each wooden action figure costs $5.

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and he has $50 left.

\[ \text{Total spent on plastic action figures} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

After buying the plastic action figures, the remaining money will be:

\[ \text{Remaining money after plastic action figures} = 50 - 6 = 44 \]

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $44:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{44}{2} = 22 \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he bought wooden action figures. Let's calculate how many wooden action figures he bought:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- 20 roses to the first shop
- 15 roses to the second shop
- 30 roses to the third shop

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- Cost of cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Revenue from selling 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

The error in degrees for 520 degrees is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20.8 \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups, which is 20 more than what Judy bought. This confirms the number of cups Judy bought (40 - 20 = 20, but this is not relevant to the calculation).

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought = Cups Judy bought + Cups her friend brought
\[ = 12 + 40 = 52 \]

Total dishes brought = Dishes Judy bought + Dishes her friend brought
\[ = 24 + 44 = 68 \]

Total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 + 68 = 120 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount applied.

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of one box is reduced by 10% of $100.00.

\[ \text{Discount per box} = 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ \text{Discounted price per box} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, the total cost for 2 boxes at the discounted price is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ \text{Total contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs of contacts is:

\[ \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per pair} = \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked:

- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.

So, Jill's total hours worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked:

- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

So, John's total hours worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John:

- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, the final numerical answer is $40."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]

The number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speed for the third test. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words per minute after the second test, so his speed for the third test will be:

Now we have the three typing speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[ 52 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 52 \]"
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we can calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

"First, let's determine the weights of each dog based on the information provided:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \( 5 \times 44 = 220 \) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake for a week:
\[ \text{Protein intake per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

- The base price for each implant is $2000.
- George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
- One of the implants has an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is therefore 90 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can find the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate the number of months:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is also a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month (since $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month).
   - The new funding per month is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars.
   - Cost for the next 45 months: \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Summing the initial and extended funding: \(100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, so the total is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days it will take to sell the total amount of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we know that the bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is given by the number of rows multiplied by the number of seats per row:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights available.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 4 \text{ intersections} \times 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving some to his sister.

   - After chewing during school, on the way home, and after dinner, Jim has chewed 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.
   - Therefore, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.
   - He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
   - So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age:

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age:

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Adam will need 4 years to grow to the required height. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = $2000 \)
- The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, so \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \).
- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so \( S = G - 400 \).

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \( $4800 \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

\[ \text{Total stamps} = \text{Snowflake stamps} + \text{Truck stamps} + \text{Rose stamps} \]
\[ \text{Total stamps} = 16 + 19 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Total stamps} = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead and Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to close the gap.

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour. This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
2. Now, since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 11 fish, Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Let's denote the number of classes he can miss as \( x \). This means he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

According to the problem, this cost per class must be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Now, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Dividing both sides by -10 (and reversing the inequality sign):

\[
4 \geq x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \leq 4
\]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10, and his parents will not sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) it will take him to dig the hole is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:

Total extra cost = $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package)
Total extra cost = $13,500

Finally, we add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:

Total cost = Base price + Total extra cost
Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500
Total cost = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine the amount of flour in one bag.

Given that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add the distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"

"To find the total number of likes Fishio has on her photo after receiving 20000 more new likes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of likes after three weeks.
2. Add the 20000 new likes to the number of likes after three weeks.

First, we know that after 1 week, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. The initial number of likes was 2000, so:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, Fishio had 140000 likes. She then received 20000 more likes recently, so we add these to the 140000 likes:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Therefore, the total number of likes is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - The total sales in two months were the sum of the sales in the first and second months.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
\[
4S + 2G = 70
\]
\[
S + G = 20
\]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = 20 - S
\]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
\]
\[
2S + 40 = 70
\]
\[
2S = 30
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( G \):
\[
G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Check the total number of legs:
\[
4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70

"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

So, after the first visit, the total number of toys needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ (current toys)} + 4 \text{ (new toys)} = 8 \text{ toys} \]

Next, James went back to see that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 4 dogs, and now there are 8 new dogs, making a total of:
\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dogs} \]

So, twice as many more dogs than when he left would be:

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \times 36}{6} = 192 \text{ hash browns}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is 192."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding load = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ \text{Katarina's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ 68 = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 300 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation for the final length as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the time he spent mowing the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode:
- In ""turtle"" mode, to mow half of the lawn, it would take half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, to mow half of the lawn, it would take half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent in each mode to find the total time:
- Time spent in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we first need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking.

1. They spend 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
2. They spend another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

Adding these times together:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

They have a total of 30 minutes to get to school. Subtracting the time they have already spent walking:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, we can write:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total time he has before dinner:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 100 minutes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years, Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We can represent this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Now, we can solve for Gary's truck capacity:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Subtract 8800 from both sides to isolate Gary's truck capacity:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds of gravel.

"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city.
2. Determine the percentage of the city's water use that is for industrial purposes.
3. Subtract the industrial use percentage from the total city use percentage to find the non-industrial use percentage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

Step 2: 80% of the city's water use is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining 20% is for non-industrial purposes.

Step 3: Calculate the non-industrial use percentage of the total river's water. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water, the non-industrial use within the city's water is 20% of 40%. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Non-industrial use percentage} = 40\% \times 20\% = 40\% \times 0.20 = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

2. Calculate the number of tiles needed:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. 

The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price per pound at the store is $2.5, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid from the cost he would have paid at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself instead of buying them at the store. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each, so the original total cost would be:

\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

The price of each computer was 10% higher than the planned price. Therefore, the new price of each computer is:

\[ 700 \times 1.10 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

- John uses 6 eggs, each with 75 calories, so the total calories from eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.
- He uses 2 oz of cheese, and cheese has 120 calories per ounce, so the total calories from cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.
- He uses 2 oz of ham, and ham has 40 calories per ounce, so the total calories from ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Adding these together, the total calories in the omelet are \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

So, the final numerical answer is 770 calories."

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, so the cost of 6 pencils is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of one eraser is $0.25, so the cost of 8 erasers is:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the pencils and erasers. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5.00 \]"

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{3550}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes:
- Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

So, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is:
$120 + $75 = $195

Now, let's calculate the damage that would be done to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed. The damage is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:
$450 - $195 = $255

Therefore, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is $255."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 3 \times 9 = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
\[ 24 + 27 = 51 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes, so the dog takes:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of Topher's shoe as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in that time.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

A pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he will need, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of these two books is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is 2."
"To solve the problem, let's first determine the number of books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as \( M \) and the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \).

According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Sean has:**
   Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has}
   \]
   Solving for the number of marbles Cal has:
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{336}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. If we divide these students into 12 groups, we can find the number of students per group by performing the division:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form, implying that the current number of groups (6) is insufficient for the activity to be divided into 12 groups.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the current number of groups from the required number of groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, 6 more groups are needed to form.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental pattern and then sum up the totals.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- In a 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
- During the weekdays, Candy rents out \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs.
- During the weekends, Candy rents out \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs.
- Therefore, in a single 4-week month, Candy rents out \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

Since we are looking at two 4-week months, the total number of chairs rented out is:
\[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."
"To determine the final number of bananas in the pile, we will follow the sequence of events step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas**: Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. **Arnold steals half**: Arnold steals half of the bananas, so Gunther is left with half of the initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas**: Gunther adds 25 more bananas to the pile.
   \[
   \text{Bananas now} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas**: Arnold steals 12 bananas from the pile.
   \[
   \text{Bananas now} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. **Gunther adds 6 bananas**: Gunther adds 6 more bananas to the pile.
   \[
   \text{Bananas now} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Thus, the final number of bananas in the pile is 43.

"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses equals \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- He sent 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen plates equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, let's account for the items that were returned broken:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates that were returned:

- The number of glasses returned is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- The number of plates returned is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, let's add the returned items to the initial count to find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now:

- Total glasses now: \(96 - 10 + 86 = 172\).
- Total plates now: \(48 - 6 + 42 = 84\).

So, Jeff now has 172 glasses and 84 plates. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - After trading 27 small stickers, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - She has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - She has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, the 20 large buttons are equivalent to 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - Therefore, the total number of small buttons she has is 60 (from trading large stickers) + 60 (equivalent from large buttons) = 120 small buttons.
   - Adding the 20 large buttons, she has a total of 120 small buttons + 20 large buttons = 140 buttons.

The final numerical answer is 140."
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 133."

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = 6
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):

\[
P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time he spends driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back at the same speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Total number of movies:** 600
2. **Movies in series:** 1/3 of 600 = 200 movies
3. **Remaining movies:** 600 - 200 = 400 movies
4. **Older movies:** 40% of the remaining 400 movies = 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies
5. **Normal movies:** 400 - 160 = 240 movies

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type of movie:

- **Cost of series movies:** Since a third of the movies are in series and he can buy them for $6 each, the cost for these movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.
- **Cost of older movies:** Older movies cost $5 each, so the cost for these movies is 160 * $5 = $800.
- **Cost of normal movies:** Normal movies cost $10 each, so the cost for these movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Finally, we sum up the costs for all the movies to get the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

So, the final numerical answer is $4400."

First, let's determine the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours, but we need to subtract the 1.5 hours they spent hiking to find the driving time:
\[ \text{Driving time} = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]
At a speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we sum the distances driven and hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:

\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 30 points less than Emma for the timer. Let's denote the points Emma gets for the timer as \( T_E \). Then Ava gets \( T_E - 30 \) points for the timer.

The score for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Ava's score: \( 10E_A + 5B_A + (T_E - 30) \)
- Emma's score: \( 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \)

Substituting the expressions for \( E_A \) and \( B_A \) in terms of \( E_E \) and \( B_E \):

\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

So, Ava's score becomes:
\[ 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + (T_E - 30) = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + T_E - 30 = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65 \]

Emma's score remains:
\[ 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65) - (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E) = 65 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 65 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{65} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. If two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, then the combined cost of these two pizzas is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost of the four pizzas gives us the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on 5 days.
   - Twice the usual times on the other 2 days.

2. **Calculate Biking Frequency for 5 Days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - Total biking for these 5 days = 3 times/day * 5 days = 15 times.

3. **Calculate Biking Frequency for the Other 2 Days:**
   - They ride twice the usual times on these 2 days.
   - Usual biking frequency is 3 times/day.
   - Twice the usual times = 2 * 3 times/day = 6 times/day.
   - Total biking for these 2 days = 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

4. **Total Biking Frequency for the Week:**
   - Sum of biking for the 5 days and the 2 days.
   - Total biking = 15 times (for 5 days) + 12 times (for 2 days) = 27 times.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27 times."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week:**
   - Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - Total distance in a week is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG.
   - Therefore, the amount of fuel consumed in a week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ MPG}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed in a week:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3/gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of 140 quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of 10 twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total yield from both types of plants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Total tomatoes} + \text{Total eggplants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}

\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing $100."
"First, let's determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature during the night is 12 degrees, which is below the freezing point of 32 degrees. To find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees, we calculate the difference:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the initial 8 hours of work:

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours she worked, which is:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, we calculate the special hourly rate:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Pay for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the pay for the additional hours to find the total pay for the day:

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10.00. To find the sale price of the jeans, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the $50.00 bill:

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}

Total cost including premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 students.
Total number of students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 0.78 or 78%.

The final numerical answer is 78."

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is then:

\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students have consumed some. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many more candies he needs to sell to have all of his candy, we subtract the number of candies he still has from the total number of candies he has:

200 (total candies he has now) - 150 (candies he has already sold) = 50.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

1. **Beginning of January:** 10 students
2. **End of January:** 10 * 2 = 20 students
3. **End of February:** 20 * 2 = 40 students
4. **End of March:** 40 * 2 = 80 students
5. **End of April:** 80 * 2 = 160 students
6. **End of May:** 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, let's calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students by the end of May = Number of students at the end of May - Number of students at the beginning of the year
- Additional students by the end of May = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this is the total number of branches he climbed during the week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 60 branches per day."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

First, she picks:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Total petals picked: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

She drops 1 of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals

Total petals dropped: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Petals remaining in the vase: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they used 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows and they dropped 3 on the ground, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack plays for 20 minutes. Each of the two friends who are worse than him can play for 10 minutes (half of 20 minutes). The friend who is significantly better can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

Now, let's add up the total play time:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 10 minutes
- Friend 3: 30 minutes

Total play time = 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

They play for a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since they play for 70 minutes, we need to determine how many 70-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240}{70} = 3.4286 \]
This means they can play 3 full intervals of 70 minutes and a portion of the fourth interval. Since they can't play a fraction of a game, we consider only the full intervals.

So, they play 3 full games. Each game costs 1 quarter, so the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars and gives away 16 cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars he remains with is \(40 - 8 - 16 = 16\) cars.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide $125,000 by 20:

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Calculate the total time in hours.
4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time Sandy walked over the two days in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate his daily earnings:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Each task pays $1.20.

So, the earnings per cycle are:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Now, his daily earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Next, to find out his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is:
\[ \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we add the production from the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production in the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and then sum them up.

"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs based on the items she needs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:

- Additional mirrors: Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.
- Additional chandeliers: Angela needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
- Additional pictures: Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

So, the cost for the additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
The cost for the additional chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
The cost for the additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Adding these together, the total cost for the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

Now, we add this to the base installation cost of $129.00.

So, the total cost for Angela is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final numerical answer is $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony's savings can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speeds, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

First, let's establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos and the time it takes for them to cross the highway. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. If we let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \), then the total distance \( D \) of the highway can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same highway. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). Let \( t \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway. The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t \]
\[ D = 2vt \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]
\[ 54 = 2t \]
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ t = 27 \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"If Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, then Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Since Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes. Therefore, the total number of dishes they all made together is 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue left in all three sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has a total of 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the total cost for the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also buys three packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the total cost for the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total cost for the squirt guns and water balloons is $12 + $9 = $21.

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is $40 - $21 = $19.

The final numerical answer is $19."
"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only) + \( B \) (students good at both math and English).
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only) + \( B \) (students good at both math and English).
- The total number of students is 20.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both:
\[ M + E - B = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ (5 + B) + (8 + B) - B = 20 \]
\[ 5 + 8 + B = 20 \]
\[ 13 + B = 20 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, the number of students good at both math and English is 7. Now, we can find the total number of students good at math:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes. Each group takes 10 minutes, so we divide the remaining time by the time per group:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Next, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. We multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to follow these steps:

2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms.

Let's start with the calculations:

- Initial number of goats in Farm X: 55
- Initial number of goats in Farm Y: 45
- Number of goats sold from Farm X: 10
- Number of goats sold from Farm Y: 2 * 10 = 20

Now, let's subtract the sold goats from the initial number of goats:

- Remaining goats in Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45
- Remaining goats in Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms:

- Total remaining goats: 45 + 25 = 70

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the total discount for the red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we sum the homes built each year:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote my age as \( A \), my brother's age as \( B \), and my sister's age as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( A = B - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( A = S + 2 \)
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: Let's denote my mom's age as \( M \). Then, \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
- From \( A = B - 3 \), we get \( B = A + 3 \)
- From \( A = S + 2 \), we get \( S = A - 2 \)

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the sum of our ages equation:
\[ A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6A + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6A = 78 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. Let's verify the solution:
- My brother's age \( B = A + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 \)
- My sister's age \( S = A - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11 \)
- My mom's age \( M = 3B - 1 = 3 \times 16 - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \)

Sum of our ages:
\[ A + B + S + M = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87 \]

The solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount of water on the first day:** 4000 gallons.
2. **Amount of water on the second day:** The amount doubles from the first day, so it becomes \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons.
3. **Amount of water on the third day:** The amount increases by 6000 gallons from the second day, so it becomes \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people day by day, starting with the initial 10 infected people.

**Day 0 (initial):**
- Number of infected people = 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = 10 * 6 = 60
- Total number of infected people = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = 70 * 6 = 420
- Total number of infected people = 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = 490 * 6 = 2940
- Total number of infected people = 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she can bake in those 5 hours:
- Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour.
- Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) banana bread loaves.

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from these 10 loaves:
- Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, 10 loaves will yield \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice:
- Total revenue = \( 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \) dollars.

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

- The number of red cars is given as 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
  \]
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
  \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we get \( A \).
- From \( S = A + 25 \), we substitute \( A = F - 12 \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's verify this:
- If Fawn has 28 books, then Anne has \( 28 - 12 = 16 \) books.
- Sofie has \( 16 + 25 = 41 \) books.
- The total number of books is \( 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \), which matches the given total.

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month, and then find out how much Keenan pays per week.

1. Calculate Madeline's monthly payment:
   Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost.
   \[
   \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly payment:
   Since the total monthly cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate Keenan's weekly payment:
   There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find his weekly payment.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, after the first day, he has \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so the remaining pieces are:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, after the third day, he has \( 26 - 14 = 12 \) pieces left.

The total number of pieces he has eaten so far is the sum of the pieces he ate on the first, second, and third days:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 48."
"To solve this, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00

First, we calculate the cost of one bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 13.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03.

Total cost of 16 bolts = 16 * $0.03 = $0.48

"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles:

Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles.

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

So, Paul now has 80 marbles.

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate 1/4 of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the additional marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Paul has left is 60."
"First, let's calculate the number of correctly answered questions for each type:

- Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 = 0.80 * 10 = 8 questions
- True/false questions: 90% of 20 = 0.90 * 20 = 18 questions
- Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 = 0.60 * 5 = 3 questions

Next, we calculate the total points Amy scores:

- Points from multiple-choice questions: 8 questions * 1 point/question = 8 points
- Points from true/false questions: 18 questions * 1 point/question = 18 points
- Points from long-answer questions: 3 questions * 5 points/question = 15 points

Finally, we sum up the points:

Total points = 8 points + 18 points + 15 points = 41 points

The final numerical answer is 41."
"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have after selling the rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will receive is:

\[
\text{Total money received} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, Sarah plans to use this money to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she received:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bacon} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10, a pack of chicken costs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 196 = -131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the items. She is short by:
\[
131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys. 

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones won't be paired. Since 20% of the microphones won't find space, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
- There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, the number of birds flying overhead is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, the number of birds feeding is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we can add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

So, the final numerical answer is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is 50 / 5 = 10 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for both the orchids and the African daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the African daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\) petals.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of a thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of a thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob, we can determine the speed of a whirligig, which spins five times faster than a thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \text{ meters/second} \]"

- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for her daily diet is given as $11. So, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise:
- His original hourly wage was $10.
- The raise was $2 per hour.
- Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:
- He works 8 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we calculate his total weekly earnings:
- His new hourly wage is $12.
- He works 40 hours in a week.
- Therefore, his total weekly earnings are $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 3x \) lawns for Kamala.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 5x \) lawns for Alba.

The total number of lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( 6 \times 9x = 54x \).

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is $54x, and the earnings from lemonade sales is \( 80 - 54x \).

To find the value of \( x \), we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since the problem does not provide a specific number of lawns mowed for Joe, we can infer that the earnings from mowing lawns alone should be a whole number and fit within the total earnings of $80. 

Let's assume \( x = 1 \) (the simplest case):
- Earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \)
- Earnings from mowing lawns for Kamala and Alba: \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \)
- Total earnings from mowing lawns: \( 6 + 54 = 60 \)
- Earnings from lemonade sales: \( 80 - 60 = 20 \)

Thus, Tasha made $20 from lemonade sales.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times $25/\text{hour} = $750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to find out his profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

\[ $750 - $500 = $250 \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[ \text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

Now, to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

25 - 13 = 12 pages

So, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

1. The pot can fill four adult's bowls.
2. The pot can also fill eight child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining two bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill eight child's bowls, and we have two child's bowls available for the children. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup is:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ time per child}
\]

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch once from the leftover soup.

"To calculate the total amount William spent, we need to multiply the cost of the notebooks by the number of notebooks he bought and then add the cost of the ballpen.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Deepa has purchased. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes left} \]

For the red shoe boxes, he uses 1/3 of them. Since he originally has 9 red shoe boxes, the number of red shoe boxes he uses is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:

\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left} \]

Therefore, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:

\[ 4 \text{ blue} + 6 \text{ red} = 10 \text{ shoe boxes} \]

The final numerical answer is 10."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so he had \(2 \times 9 = 18\) books. After losing 2 books, Joseph currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

"Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives away \( \frac{1}{5} \) of them to Jamie, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \) marbles. He also gives 10 marbles to Donald. Therefore, the total number of marbles Dean gives away is \( 6 + 10 = 16 \) marbles. 

So, the number of marbles left for Dean is \( 30 - 16 = 14 \).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Duncan's age eight years ago as \( D_{-8} \) and Adam's age four years ago as \( A_{-4} \).

Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we can write:
\[ D_{-8} = 60 - 8 = 52 \]

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D_{-8} = 2 \cdot A_{-4} \]
\[ 52 = 2 \cdot A_{-4} \]
\[ A_{-4} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is:
\[ A_{-4} + 4 = 26 + 4 = 30 \]

Finally, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. 

So, the number of packages he completes per hour is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday, he completes:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:
\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he drinks:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there were 20 red balloons. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 2R + 3Y = 58 \)
2. \( R = 20 \)

Substituting the value of \( R \) from the second equation into the first equation, we get:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. 

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups by dividing the total miles driven by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours worked over the three days:
- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

Total hours worked = \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"Let's break down the expenses and calculate the total amount spent by Julia and Nadine.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of balloons**: 1 dozen balloons means 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is \(12 \times 0.25 = $3\).
3. **Cost of ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the cost is \(2 \times 7 = $14\).

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[11 + 3 + 14 = 28\]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowance, the total amount given by their mother is $28. Since they each received the same amount, we divide the total amount by 2:
\[28 \div 2 = 14\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[14\]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's sum up all his pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in total. She has 27 cups in total and uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

Since she divides these 12 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of each is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Now, we know that she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total. She divides these cups into 3 rows, with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Since the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is the same, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ 2 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. 

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to determine how many trips he can make in that time. 

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours and he needs to collect 24 berries, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the popcorn and candy:
- Popcorn costs $8.
- A box of candy costs $2.
- Colby has 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.
- Total cost for popcorn = 2 * $8 = $16.
- Total cost for candy = 4 * $2 = $8.
- Total cost for popcorn and candy = $16 + $8 = $24.

Colby starts with $150 and spends $24 on popcorn and candy:
- Remaining money = $150 - $24 = $126.

Next, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. We know that:
- Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each.
- Tickets for other days cost $7 each.

Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days. Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, he can only see movies on Fridays or Saturdays. Therefore, he can see 5 more movies on Fridays or Saturdays with the remaining $126.

To find out how many more movies he can see:
- Each movie ticket costs $10.
- Number of additional movies he can see = $126 / $10 = 12.6.

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 12 more movies.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories from all the pastries:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40000 + 45000 = 85000

The final numerical answer is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car. Using the same formula:

For the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, let's find the average total distance spat by adding the total distances and dividing by the number of people.

Average total distance = (Total distance Zoey spat + Total distance Sydney spat) / 2
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2
Average total distance = 820 feet / 2
Average total distance = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total production and revenue for each machine over a month (30 days) and then find the difference.

- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets:
- Each widget sells for $6.

Total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 12-hour and the 24-hour options, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The base cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
- Since Cameron stays for 24 hours, there are no additional hours to pay for.

So, the cost for the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour option plus the additional hours:
- The base cost for 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 24 hours, which means he has 12 additional hours.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours is 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.

So, the total cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The cost difference is 1840 pesos - 1600 pesos = 240 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 240 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option plus the additional hours instead of the 24-hour option.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, so the total hay needed for the goats is:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, so the total hay needed for the sheep is:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay needed:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = \text{Remaining after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:

\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = \text{Remaining after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Remaining after pencils}}{\text{Cost of one pen}} = \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled out after ten rounds, we need to calculate the total number of letters Craig spelled and then add the total number of letters his brother spelled.

First, we calculate the total number of letters Craig spelled. Craig spelled 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig spelled is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother to get the final answer:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Adding these together, the total charge is $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75.

Therefore, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for them:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, the rest time is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance to be swum, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new swimming speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time it took James to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission from New York Times sales is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission from Wall Street Journal sales is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Adding the two commissions together gives the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find Leo's age, we can set up the following relationships based on the information given:

1. Marcus is half of Leo's age.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Deanna is 26 years old.

First, let's determine Marcus's age. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can express Leo's age in terms of Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

"Vince starts stapling reports at 8:00 AM and continues until 11:00 PM. The total time he worked is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 hours, there are:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes is:
\[ \frac{900}{15} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \times 30 = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

The final numerical answer is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, which is 5 minutes.

4. **Total time not spent on bed**: Sleepwalking time + Early wake-up time = \(23 + 5 = 28\) minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 24 cups. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has initially is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Since he has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining, the total number of utensils is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people:

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{\text{Reported number}}{1 + \text{Percentage over}} \]

Here, the reported number is 48 and the percentage over is 20%, which can be written as 0.20 in decimal form.

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{48}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can find out how many balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

At the end of the third day, after filling in 2 holes, the number of holes left is:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was:
\[ 10 \]

So, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 27 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:

The travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation:

\[
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
\]

Simplify further:

\[
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation for \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode. It is also stated that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we can write:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:

12 boxes

Next, we determine how many boxes she gave away:

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many boxes that is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 9 \times 20 = 180 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

180"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
India has 4 more than this number = 25 + 4 = 29 states

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together:

Total number of states = Number of states in the USA + Number of states in India
Total number of states = 50 + 29 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Cherries**: There are 60 cherries in total.
2. **Robert's Cherries**: Robert has 30 cherries.
3. **Richard's Cherries**: Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
4. **Jerry's Cherries**: To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries. So, Jerry has \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\) cherries.
5. **Difference in Cherries Between Robert and Jerry**: Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. Therefore, Robert has \(30 - 10 = 20\) more cherries than Jerry.

The final numerical answer is 20."

"To find the cost of the red car, we calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car.

Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as \( D \) and the current age of his brother as \( B \).

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19, he will be 24 in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years.

At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. At that time, Emil will be 24, so his brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old. According to the problem:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Total beads = beads from mother + beads from sister + beads from friend
- Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

So, the final numerical answer is 90."
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size. The total size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie is 5 + 25 = 30. The average size of the boots worn by the two is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower growth. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:

\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, each plant (including the space between them) takes up:

\[ 12 \text{ inches (flower)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} \]

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

- Each basket contains 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 3 \text{ petunias/basket} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{sweet potato vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total amount Katherine will spend:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for roses is:
- Remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
- Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose = \(3 / 1 = 3\).

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can peel and saute simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated, which is 30 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age difference between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet:
- The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

Now, we calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- The time difference between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
- Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Sum the howl durations of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and how they are distributed based on the given conditions.

Let's denote the total number of slices of the watermelon as \( S \).

Given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can say that if each kid gets a slice of size \( x \), then each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices can be expressed as:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total number of slices \( S \) is \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \( 2x \) slices, and the total number of slices is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of slices each adult gets}}{\text{Total number of slices}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed and variable costs, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is 3 days/session * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480/month.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, let's calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 350 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:

\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ G = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so:

\[ \text{Cost} = G \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Matteo}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Shandy}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is:
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is:
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, to find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity:
\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. So, the charge after 5 hours is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. So, the charge after an additional 3 hours is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate the values of \((0.91)^5\) and \((0.93)^3\):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate the product of 0.658 and 0.817:
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ x \times 0.536 \approx 0.28 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.536:
\[ x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 each = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased:

\[ \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 15 \times 60 = 900 \]

Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ \text{Packs given to friends} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} = 15 - 2 = 13 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets each of her 10 friends received. We divide the number of packs given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Packs given to friends} \times \text{Pieces per pack}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{13 \times 60}{10} = \frac{780}{10} = 78 \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Growth Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. 

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. This means each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies and portraits can be calculated as follows:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums * Pictures per album
  \[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

- Number of portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
  \[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits combined is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30

"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Total number of questions**: 60
2. **Easy questions**: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
3. **Average and difficult questions**: The rest are equally divided, so 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Half of these are average and half are difficult, which means 18 questions are average and 18 questions are difficult.

Next, we calculate the points Aries is sure to get:

- **Easy questions**: Aries is sure to get 75% of the 24 easy questions correct. So, she gets 75% of 24 questions correct.
  \[
  0.75 \times 24 = 18 \text{ questions}

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. According to the problem, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 + 0.5 \times 12 = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes. If one dwarf can mine 18 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves can mine:
\[ 40 \times 18 = 720 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Finally, we find out how much ore they can mine in a month with 30 days. If 40 dwarves can mine 720 pounds of ore per day, then in 30 days they can mine:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60

3. **Extension Requests:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there's a 20% or 0.20 chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48
   - The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

   - Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having the normal teacher and not having to turn in homework: 0.48
   - Total probability of not having to turn in homework: 0.50 + 0.48 = 0.98

5. **Probability of Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - Probability of having to turn in homework: 1 - Total probability of not having to turn in homework = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02

6. **Percentage Chance:**
   - Convert the probability to a percentage: 0.02 * 100 = 2%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 2%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This is calculated by subtracting the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

So, the number of tickets to be distributed is:
\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Now, these 4750 tickets are to be split equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are \( n \) graduates. Each graduate would receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

However, the question does not specify the number of graduates, so we can only express the number of tickets each graduate would receive in terms of \( n \). If we assume the number of graduates is known, we can substitute \( n \) with that number to get the exact number of tickets per graduate.

Since the number of graduates is not provided, the final numerical answer in terms of \( n \) is:
\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

If we assume the number of graduates is a specific number, for example, 500 graduates, then each graduate would receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{500} = 9.5 \]

So, if there are 500 graduates, each graduate would receive 9.5 tickets. But without the specific number of graduates, the answer in terms of \( n \) is:
\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

Since the question asks for a final numerical answer and does not specify the number of graduates, I will provide the answer in terms of \( n \) as requested."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out her net earnings after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books and pencils.

Ted buys 3 books at $16 each:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he buys 3 pencils at $6 each:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \]

Richard will take 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since he needs to do this 8 times (from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth), the total time is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
2. Determine how many packs of eight apples can be made from the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples. Therefore, two boxes contain:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples can be made from 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18
\]

Now, let's find the total cost of both types of cheese.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} + \text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = \$22 + \$18 = \$40
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount.

\[
\text{Money left} = \$50 - \$40 = \$10
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income during college. Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job. During college, his income tripled, so his income during college was:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

The amount of money he lost from not working while in college is the difference between his pre-college income and his income during college:

\[ 25,000 - 75,000 = -50,000 \]

This negative value indicates that he actually gained $50,000 in income during college compared to his pre-college income. Therefore, the total amount of money he gained during college is the sum of the money he earned during college and the money he borrowed:

\[ 75,000 + 200,000 = 275,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate how long it would take for him to earn back the $275,000 he borrowed and the $50,000 he lost from not working while in school. His post-college income is triple his pre-college income, which is $75,000 per year. To find out how many years it would take to earn $275,000, we divide the total amount by his post-college income:

\[ \frac{275,000}{75,000} = \frac{275}{75} = \frac{55}{15} = \frac{11}{3} \approx 3.67 \]

Since he can't work for a fraction of a year in this context, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 4 years to earn back the money.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Each piece of fabric is an 8 feet by 10 feet rectangle. To find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply its length by its width:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Then, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average loss per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.1667 \]"
"To find the total population in South America, we can multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city

Plugging in the numbers:

Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now, let's calculate the total population:

Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total population in South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. He grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they divided is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, let's convert the fraction of a day into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days the painters worked over the 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} = 3 \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the total hours of work for the team over these 21 days:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters working together, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 47.25 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 2:
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{4x + x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The depreciation rate is 21% per year, which means the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
\[ \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the car in 2009:
\[ \text{Price in 2009} = \text{Price in 2008} \times 0.79 = (20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79 \]

Finally, we calculate the price of the car in 2010:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = \text{Price in 2009} \times 0.79 = ((20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79) \times 0.79 \]

We can simplify this calculation by recognizing that the price in 2010 is the initial price multiplied by \(0.79^3\) (since 2010 is 3 years after 2007):
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \(0.79^3\):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.624119 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.624119 = 12482.38 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{12482.38} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate how far she has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

Now, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance to New York City:

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance Bernice has already driven: 325 kilometers

Distance still needed to drive: 1955 - 325 = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.

First, we calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

3. **Second stop**: 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \)) board the train.
   - People who disembark: 50.
   - People who board: 100.
   - New number of people: \( 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \) people.
4. **Third stop**: 80 more people disembark.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6
Total cost = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to determine how many tiles are required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet. Given the kitchen floor area is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the additional cost as follows:

\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads = 2 (for twin beds) + 1 (for king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:
- Total loads in a year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is:
156"

In 4 weeks, they watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

The final numerical answer is 24."
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to calculate the number of stickers he has each year and then sum them up.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, the number of stickers he had at the end of last year would be:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
So, the number of stickers he has at the end of this year would be:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is:
\[ 250 \]

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."

2. Becky ate 10 slices.
3. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \(J\). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so \(10 = J + 3\). Solving for \(J\), we get \(J = 7\).
4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.
5. The total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia is \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's determine how many emails James doesn't respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails don't require any response, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails a day. This means he responds to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add them step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score he received across all 4 tests. 

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for these 3 tests is:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \]

He scored 80 on his 4th test. Adding this score to the total:
\[ 300 + 80 = 380 \]

Now, to find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

And they ate 80% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after the new order is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that successfully delivered.

First, we know that Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks that failed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- For the first pound, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the second pound, he gets the second pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, he gets the fourth pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, he gets the sixth pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
- First pound: $4.00
- Second pound: $2.00
- Third pound: $4.00
- Fourth pound: $2.00
- Fifth pound: $4.00
- Sixth pound: $2.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[ \boxed{18.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Guests who could not come: 4
- Guests who will come: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- Base fee for renting the theater: $125
- Additional fee per guest: $6
- Total additional fee for 41 guests: 41 * $6 = $246

Finally, we add the base fee and the additional fee to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $246 = $371

The final numerical answer is $371."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it. So, the amount Maggie spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Therefore, the amount Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it. So, the amount Riza spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Therefore, the amount Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. The florist offers roses by the dozen at $15 each, so Jenny can buy one dozen roses for $15 and still have $10 left. This means she needs to buy an additional 3 roses to reach 15 roses. The cost for 3 roses is:

\[ 3 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$6 \]

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 (for the dozen) + $6 (for the additional 3 roses) = $21. Since Jenny has $25, she will have:

\[ \$25 - \$21 = \$4 \]

After paying for the roses, she will have $4 left. Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters she will receive is:

\[ \frac{\$4}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = 6 \times 5.50 = \$33.00 \]

\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the totals to find the overall amount of money Terry makes:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$162.00 \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine how long Paul will wait for his train. Since Paul arrives at the station at the time the fourth train arrives (85 minutes), and the fourth train is the one he needs to board, he will wait 0 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage based on the original price.

**Step 1: Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount percentage based on the original price.**

The discount amount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.

2. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per spring per hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one jellyfish is created every second, in one hour, one spring creates \( 3600 \) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per spring per 4 hours:**
   - In 4 hours, one spring creates \( 4 \times 3600 = 14400 \) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \( 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72000 \]"
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the question. Binkie's score is 90. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, we perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 195 \]"
"To solve this, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the time taken for each segment.

1. **First Segment (Halfway to the Store):**
   - Distance: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

2. **Second Segment (Back Home):**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total Time = Time for First Segment + Time for Second Segment = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so its growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply its growth rate by the number of years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

So, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the net number of bales produced or removed each hour and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales, and the truck picks up 3 bales. Therefore, the net number of bales produced each hour is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

Over a 6-hour workday, the total number of bales produced is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Since no bales are added to the field during this time, the number of bales left in the field after the 6-hour workday is:
\[ 0 + 12 = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in classes and the additional time he spends learning on weekends.

First, let's determine the total number of periods John has to attend each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the time spent in classes each day is:
\[ 8 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the time spent in classes each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the time spent on weekends is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the time spent on weekends:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce, the height after the first bounce will be:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 48 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. 

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

According to the problem, the Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means:

\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1080 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

3. Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then determine how many people he helps.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Next, we calculate the number of days Billy takes off. He takes 20% off, so:
- Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

Therefore, the number of days he works is:
- Number of days he works = Total days - Number of days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Finally, the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works is:
- Total people helped = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people.

So, the final numerical answer is 240."

"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the card is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the card:

Remaining balance: $70.00
Frying pan: $16.00
Set of towels: $27.00

Total charge: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \) dollars.

Now, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement. We'll assume she wants to retire after 20 years of saving, and she will live for 20 years after retirement.

Let \( n \) be the number of years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement.

The total amount she needs to save for her retirement is:
\[ \text{Total retirement savings} = \text{Annual living expenses} \times \text{Number of years after retirement} \]
\[ \text{Total retirement savings} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount she needs to save over \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Total savings} = \text{Annual savings} \times n \]
\[ \text{Total savings} = 20,000 \times n \]

We set the total savings equal to the total retirement savings:
\[ 20,000 \times n = 800,000 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:

   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cut parts is 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
5

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys short of the order.

However, since the first 4 workers only produced 200 toys, it's clear that the problem statement might have a slight inconsistency or misinterpretation, but we'll proceed with the given data to find the production rate of the fifth worker.

The fifth worker needs to produce the remaining \(400 - 200 = 200\) toys in the remaining 10 hours. Therefore, the fifth worker needs to produce \(200 \div 10 = 20\) toys per hour.

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms/bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 50 days."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age (14) was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) (since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is \( S + (S + 12) = 2S + 12 \).

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of each box (which includes both the crayons and the box itself) is:

\[ \text{Total weight of each box} = 8 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 8 \text{ ounces (box)} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the boxes. Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight in ounces is:

\[ \text{Total weight in ounces} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 16 \text{ ounces/box} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]

Let's confirm this with a final line:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk separately, and then sum them up to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time for the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Lastly, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. After pouring, the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the second mug is \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce is poured from the 5-ounce mug).

The final temperature of the water in his water bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. Since he has 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( \frac{T}{5} \) degree water, the final temperature \( F \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ F = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times \frac{T}{5}}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + \frac{T}{5}}{5} = \frac{660 + T}{25} \]

We know that Donny can only drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need to find the minimum temperature \( T \) such that the final temperature \( F \) is at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{660 + T}{25} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 25 to clear the denominator:

\[ 660 + T \geq 1000 \]

Subtracting 660 from both sides:

\[ T \geq 340 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 340 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 340 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add that to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(20 \times 7 = 140\) cows.
- For three weeks, they bring \(140 \times 3 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(10 \times 7 = 70\) chickens.
- For three weeks, they bring \(70 \times 3 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[470 + 230 = 700\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out the cost of each single bagel after ordering 4 packs with a 10% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

- Each pack costs $10.00.
- Russell orders 4 packs.
- Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

Next, step 2:

- The discount is 10%.
- Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.
- Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, step 3:

- Each pack contains 9 bagels.
- Russell orders 4 packs.
- Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

Finally, step 4:

- Total cost with discount is $36.00.
- Total number of bagels is 36.
- Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00/bagel.

So, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is $1.00."
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, 3 less than 6 is:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to calculate how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

Next, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

Finally, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Since he sells each mobile device for $40, the total revenue from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the 6 mobile devices. Each mobile device costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

2. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
   \[
   11500 - 4200 = 7300
   \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
7300
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to 1 for practical purposes)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows = \( 0.6667 + 2 = 2.6667 \approx 3 \) (rounding to 3 for practical purposes)

Now, we calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
- Percentage chance = \( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \times 100 \)
- Percentage chance = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final numerical answer is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham initially owned. He owns 80 square meters of unused land.

He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

The price per square meter for the first sale is:
\[ \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

The price per square meter for the second sale is:
\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from the first two sales:
- Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \text{ square meters} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 50 \text{ dollars} \)
- Revenue from the second sale: \( 20 \text{ square meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \)

Total revenue from the first two sales:
\[ 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining land after the first two sales is:
\[ 80 \text{ square meters} - 40 \text{ square meters} - 20 \text{ square meters} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
\[ 20 \text{ square meters} \times 3 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total money Abraham will earn after selling all his land is:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day. Since he changes his mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, we calculate:
\[ 2 \text{ masks/time} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days. Since he uses 6 masks in one day, in 2 days he will use:
\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\).

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\).

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of garbage collections per week is:
- \(1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections}\).

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his weekly earnings are:
- \(3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1248}

   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5. \]

And the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Ronnie received $5, so the total amount of money Rissa had initially was $15.

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the total area of the bedrooms and the living room. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, we can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
240

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The chalk piece was 5 inches long initially.
   - 45% of 5 inches is \( 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - Therefore, 2.25 inches of chalk was used on Monday.

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The initial length of the chalk piece was 5 inches.
   - After using 2.25 inches, the remaining chalk is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Determine the rate of chalk usage:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means that each day, 80% of the chalk is recycled.

4. **Calculate the remaining chalk after each day:**
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after day \( n \) as \( R_n \).
   - Initially, \( R_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
   - After the first day, \( R_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - After the second day, \( R_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.
   - After the third day, \( R_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \) inches.
   - After the fourth day, \( R_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \) inches.
   - After the fifth day, \( R_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.89952 \) inches.

5. **Determine the number of days before the chalk has to be recycled:**
   - The teacher will have to recycle the chalk when it is less than 2 inches.
   - From the calculations above, we see that after 4 days, the remaining chalk is 1.1264 inches, which is less than 2 inches.
   - Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 4 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from cheese pizza = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from pepperoni pizza = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Next, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we can add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from both sets of days together:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3.33 \]"
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we need to determine Jim's age at that time. 

Let's denote Jim's age when the show came out as \( J \). According to the problem, John's age at that time was \( 2J \). Given that John is 28 years old now, we can infer that the difference in their ages has remained constant over the 20 years since the show came out.

So, when the show came out, John was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years older than Jim. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 8 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old when the show came out. Since 20 years have passed, Jim is now:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Thus, Jim is 24 years old now. 

The final numerical answer is:
24"
"Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which means she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices. 

The total number of slices they all ate is 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38, they have \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They start the day with 38 bandages used plus the 50 they ordered, which totals 88 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They have \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages left, which means they borrowed 16 bandages from the previous day's order.
   - They start the day with 28 bandages used plus the 50 they ordered, which totals 78 bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, totaling 100 bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - They have \(78 - 25 = 53\) bandages left at the end of the third day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages they started with on the first day:

- On the first day, they started with 38 bandages used plus the 50 they ordered, totaling 88 bandages.
- On the second day, they started with 28 bandages used plus the 50 they ordered, totaling 78 bandages.
- On the third day, they started with 53 bandages left, which means they borrowed 25 bandages from the previous day's order.

To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to account for the borrowing from the second day:

- They borrowed 25 bandages from the second day's order, so they actually started the second day with \(78 - 25 = 53\) bandages.
- Therefore, they started the first day with 88 bandages.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 88.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

So, the total cost for the haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final numerical answer is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not miss any days in April, she receives this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Adding her regular pay and the bonus together gives her total earnings for April:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$310.00 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

For doing laundry:
- Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each laundry.
- So, he earned $3.00.

For cleaning his room:
- Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each cleaning.
- So, he earned $1.50.

For taking the trash out:
- Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each trip.
- So, he earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

For emptying the dishwasher:
- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time.
- So, he earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
- $3.00 (from laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning his room) + $1.50 (from taking the trash) + $3.00 (from emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00.

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in a single shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, we sum these numbers:
\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spends in total:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was left after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:

- On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons.
- On the second day, his children drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the third day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the fourth day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person could drink:

\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of fish**: 66

2. **Fish with red stripes**:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Therefore, the number of fish with red stripes is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

3. **Remaining fish after accounting for red-striped fish**:
   - The remaining fish are \( 66 - 22 = 44 \).

4. **Fish with blue stripes**:
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Therefore, the number of fish with blue stripes is \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

5. **Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes**:
   - We already know there are 22 fish with red stripes.
   - We also know there are 20 fish with blue stripes.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes is \( 22 + 20 = 42 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of 6 colors is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one of the makeup sets. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor itself, which is 240 inches.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is 168."
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total miles walked by all dogs per day is the sum of the miles walked by each dog:

"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed over the specified periods:

- For the low setting, Brian ran it for 3 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the low setting is \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters}\).
- For the medium setting, Brian ran it for 3 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters}\).
- For the high setting, Brian ran it for 5 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the high setting is \(5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Finally, we sum up the total amount of water removed over all the settings:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many Jordan changes.

First, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan makes per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers after the first stop**: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers after the second stop**: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
6. **Number of passengers who entered at the third stop**: The number of passengers doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
7. **Total number of passengers after the third stop**: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of passengers who need to be removed to fill the remaining spaces is:
\[270 - 200 = 70\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it has increased by 150%. The increase in cost is calculated as follows:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \]
So, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for the first 5 years. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years, she makes:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits} \]
The total cost for these 15 visits is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

Then, calculate the total cost for the next 3 years. In these 3 years, she makes:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]
The total cost for these 9 visits is:
\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \]

Finally, add the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years to find the total amount spent:
\[ 75 + 45 = 120 \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 6th).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students.

2. **Number of students per group:**
   - Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.

3. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Total students = 30 students.
   - Students per group = 8 students.
   - Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 30 / 8 = 3.75 groups.
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which is 4 groups.

4. **Time each group takes:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes.

5. **Total time required:**
   - Number of groups = 4.
   - Time per group = 45 minutes.
   - Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. 

The final numerical answer is 180 minutes."
"To calculate how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost for the wooden tables is:
4 wooden tables * $20 per table = $80

The cost for the roof frames is:
2 roof frames * $10 per frame = $20

Adding these together gives the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, the final numerical answer is $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of meat needed:**
   Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the amount of meat required as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning required is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Amount of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]
(There are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is 10.)

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional charges:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if both services are purchased together. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. Since there are 10 fingers (2 hands), and each nail art costs $3, the total cost for nail art is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the discounted total cost of the services to the cost of the nail art:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase from the November price.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price in December is:
\[ 40 + (0.80 \times 40) = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

So, the price in December is $72.

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December was $72. A 50% decrease means the price in January is:
\[ 72 - (0.50 \times 72) = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is $36.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. He has 4 such lessons:

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80/\text{hour} = \$320 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

\[ 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60/\text{hour} \]

Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate:

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60/\text{hour} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours he travels is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Grapes Madeline ate**: 
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother**:
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother**:
   Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes remaining**:
   Let \( x \) be the total number of grapes at the beginning. After Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the remaining grapes are:
   \[
   x - 36
   \]

5. **Grapes used for pies**:
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

6. **Setting up the equation**:
   The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their share must equal the grapes used for the pies:
   \[
   x - 36 = 48
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 48 + 36 = 84

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese per week:
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $9.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per week for making macaroni and cheese:
- The pasta costs $1.00 a box.
- The total cost of cheese per week is $9.00.
- Therefore, the total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

To find out how much Bud spends in one year, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- So, the yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final numerical answer is $520.00."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Total hours spent cleaning}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unrealistic because it exceeds 100%. This indicates that the custodian is working more than one full day to complete the cleaning. Given the 5-day work period, we can conclude that the average percentage of their day spent cleaning is:

\[ \text{Average percentage of day spent cleaning} = \frac{250\%}{5} = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50\% \]"
"Let's break down the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \text{Total capacity of one bookcase} = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. 

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal 60 eggs.

Now, let's determine how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. 

To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since each set is sold for $1, the total selling price will be:

Total selling price = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:

- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms.
- Therefore, the number of flashlights for the rooms is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
- Adding the flashlights for the people, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- In these 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- In the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights used, we add the total number of flashlights and the total number of candles:
- Total number of flashlights and candles is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is:
56"
"To determine how many chips each person gets, we first need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell bought. He bought two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. Therefore, the total number of chips is:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

Mitchell's family consists of five members. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ \frac{110}{5} = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and then sum them up.

1. **First side**: It takes John 5 minutes.
2. **Second side**: It takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. **Third side**: It also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. **Fourth side**: It takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. **Fifth side**: It also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for all sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube is \(\boxed{30}\) minutes."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were \(20 / 2 = 10\) robots.

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish:
- The difference in drying time is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = Water for half-cup plants + Water for one-cup plants + Water for quarter-cup plants
- Total water = \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming separately, and then sum these times.

First, we note that the total distance Phineas needs to cover is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part:
- Distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time spent hopping on land. Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the time spent swimming in water. Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we sum the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming to find the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the cost for Bob to buy the popsicle sticks, we first need to calculate how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs. Since each box contains 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs \( 2x \).

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone, there are four additional phones. The total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones, we get:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ 60 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts made per day by the number of days in June:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

For the blouses:
5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00

For the pants:
2 pairs of pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00

For the skirt:
1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Now, we add these amounts to find the weekly cost:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Finally, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the cost over 5 weeks:
$47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

\[ \text{Total Words} = 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, to find out how long it would take him to speak 10 pages at his new speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500}{375} \]

Let's calculate the time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which means he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, which means he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days:
\[50 + 70 + 140 = 260\]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day for the entire week (7 days) is 60. Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw over the week is:
\[60 \times 7 = 420\]

Since we already know the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 260, the total number of people he saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days combined is:
\[420 - 260 = 160\]

Since the number of people Conor saw each day for the rest of the week is the same, the number of people he saw each of the next three days is:
\[160 \div 3 = \frac{160}{3}\]

However, we don't need to calculate the exact number for each of the last three days to find the total for the week. We already know the total for the week is 420.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[
\boxed{420}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the previous rate, so \(60 \times 4 = 240\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(240 \div 2 = 120\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat. The number of kernels that pop due to residual heat is:
\[120 \div 4 = 30\]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[440 + 30 = 470\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[470\]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart:
\[ 1 \text{ cup} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed is:
\[ 6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to find out how much food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume per day, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day \(\times\) 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Number of pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

So, the final numerical answer is 43."
"To calculate the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel stay is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus travels:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- The cost of one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the end of the third street, there are 30 children following the truck. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group, but this does not affect the number of children following the truck, as they have already left the group.

So, the final number of children following the truck is 30.

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she planned to distribute.

The total number of meals planned to be distributed is 1,360.

The number of meals given out on Friday is 64.
The number of meals given out on Saturday is 30.
The number of meals given out on Sunday is 48.

First, we calculate the total number of meals given out over the three days:
\[ 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals planned:
\[ 1360 - 142 = 1218 \]

So, the number of meals left to distribute is 1218."

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

Given:
- Each of the 3 sisters is 16 years old.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- The other brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, which means he is 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age:

- Total age of the sisters: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.
- Total age of the brothers: \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.

Adding these together gives the total age of all the siblings:

\[48 + 36 = 84\]

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Meditation Time:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
   - Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
   - Since she meditates 5 days a week, the total meditation time per week = 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time = 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

2. **Yoga Time:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
   - Total yoga time per week = 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time = 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   - Total time spent on meditation and yoga = Total meditation time + Total yoga time = 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Total time in hours = 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 30 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
11 small t-shirts * 3 square feet per small t-shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium t-shirts:
8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet per medium t-shirt = 32 square feet

For the large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet per large t-shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage from all the t-shirts:
33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, Timothy has \(3 \times 18 = 54\) pens.
2. Determine how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, Sarah has \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\) pens.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, Anne's height is:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3"" growth from her current height:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie's height before the summer was:

\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in 14 days, the company will produce \(5000 \times 14 = 70000\) bars.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is \(70000 \times 2 = 140000\).

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

\[
\boxed{140000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% off the original price, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.4 = $16.

So, the final price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

Total amount spent = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:

\[ \text{Allowance per week} = \$6 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time and then determine how long it takes to fill them all.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day at night. The net change in the number of holes per day is:
- Net change per day = 6 holes dug - 9 holes filled = -3 holes.

This means that every day, the number of holes decreases by 3. We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes.

Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes. The total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is:
\[ 9d \]

We set this equal to the total number of holes dug:
\[ 9d = 84 \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = \frac{84}{9} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \]

Since \( d \) must be a whole number of days, we round up to the next whole number, which is 10 days. This means it takes 10 days to fill in all the holes.

To find out how many weeks this is, we divide the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.43 \]

Since we are asked for the number of weeks, we take the integer part of the division and round up if necessary. Therefore, it takes 2 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300. So:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can sum up the total amount raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed and distance:**
   - Let Aaron's speed be \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per minute.
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 4 miles (since Vanessa ran 4 miles and they were partners).
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed \( v \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     v = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

2. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed:
     \[
     \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time taken by Vanessa to run 4 miles is given by:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we calculate 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price:

\[
\text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The total cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. Let's confirm this by checking the total number of legs:
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- The total number of legs is \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given information.

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices each person can have if Henry and his 3 friends (4 people in total) share the pizzas equally. We divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
