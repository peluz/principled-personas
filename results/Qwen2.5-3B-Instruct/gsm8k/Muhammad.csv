"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and then multiply that by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has each day:
- The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs to make muffins.

The number of eggs remaining after breakfast and making muffins is:
16 eggs - 3 eggs - 4 eggs = 9 eggs

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. Each egg sells for $2. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Thus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for one robe is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value due to the 150% increase.

The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh's repairs cost $50,000, so the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, Josh sells the house for $200,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, in one session, he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Thus, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses. Therefore, the total cost is 8 pairs times $8 per pair.

Let's calculate the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, I will follow the relationships given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has 160 sheep.

Adding these together: \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\).

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts:

1. First, we calculate the amount of data downloaded before the restart. Since the restart happens at 40% of the way through the download, we calculate 40% of the total file size:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

2. The download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time taken to download 80 GB is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

3. After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the file from the beginning again. The remaining data to be downloaded is:
\[ 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \]

4. The time taken to download the remaining 120 GB at a speed of 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

5. The total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time before the restart, the restart time, and the time after the restart:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
- First segment: 180 miles
- Second segment: 0 miles
- Third segment: 15 miles
- Fourth segment: 120 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"Eliza's regular rate per hour is $10. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Therefore, her total earnings for the week are:

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is \$460."
"The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. 

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180, which is 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, I will calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen.
   Cost of donuts = 3 * $68 = $204

2. Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen.
   Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 * $80 = $160

3. Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen.
   Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 * $55 = $330

Now, I will sum up the costs:
Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \( 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \( 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \( n \) years is \( 7.5n \) dollars. We set this equal to the initial cost to find \( n \):
- \( 7.5n = 90 \)

Solving for \( n \):
- \( n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \)

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):

\[
2x = 36
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the purchase plan that yields the higher return. Let's calculate the returns for both options.

For the jewelry:
- Initial value: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- Return: $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
- Total value after increase: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- Return: $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
- Total value after increase: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

The profit for the jewelry purchase is:
- $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

The profit for the electronic gadgets purchase is:
- $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the jewelry purchase yields a higher profit, the merchant should choose to purchase the jewelry. The maximum profit the merchant can achieve is $125."
"The distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances traveled in each direction. 

In the first part of the journey, each train travels 80 miles westward. In the second part of the journey, each train travels 150 miles northward. 

Therefore, the total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from teaching per year = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from coaching per year = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Finally, we sum up the earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary.

Let's calculate these values:

Earnings from teaching per year = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Earnings from coaching per year = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in a week, and then multiply that by 4 to find the total for 4 weeks. Finally, I will convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so she makes 3 omelets per day. Therefore, in a week, she makes:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, to find out how many eggs she consumes in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we need to determine the total time she should take to cover the entire distance.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles, we can calculate the total time she should take:
\[ 4 \text{ miles/hour} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, which totals 2 hours. Therefore, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is 6 miles per hour."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of the 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of the 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered as \( x \). The cost of the \( x \) boxes of pizza is:
\[ 8.50x \]

The total cost of all the items is given as $50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides:
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Divide both sides by 8.50:
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then the total cost.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period she is buying ice cream, so she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Each carton of ice cream contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she will need, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ 16 \text{ dollars} \]

\(\boxed{16}\)"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

First, Henry made his first stop after traveling 20 miles. This means he had already covered 20 miles.

Next, his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can calculate the distance of his second stop from the start of the trip as follows:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost 104 dollars."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age. Then, I will calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:

Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)

Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To calculate the total hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, I will first calculate the total hours he spends on one dog in a week and then multiply that by the number of dogs.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. There are 7 days in a week.

So, for one dog in a week:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 3.5 \text{ hours/week} \]

John takes care of 10 dogs, so for all 10 dogs in a week:
\[ 3.5 \text{ hours/week/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

Given:
1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\( (S + 30) + S = 110 \)

This simplifies to:

\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\( 2S = 80 \)

Divide both sides by 2:

\( S = 40 \)

Now, we can find \( G \):

\( G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \)

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many jewels Aaron has.
2. Use the number of jewels Aaron has to determine how many jewels Siobhan has.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Therefore, the total cost for 60 yogurts is 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is 13 * $15 = $195. 

He then spends $20 on each of the 8 video games, which totals to 8 * $20 = $160. 

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. Therefore, the total amount of money he spent on video games and the money he has left is $160 + $5 = $165.

To find out how many lego sets he still has, we note that he started with 13 lego sets and has not sold or given away any of them. Therefore, he still has 13 lego sets. 

The final numerical answer is 13."
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and divide it by the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Total time spent running in a week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

To find his speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the speeds at which Dana can walk and run, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - The skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) miles per hour.
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, which is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Total time is six hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance traveled while running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance traveled while walking: \( 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking.
   - Total distance = \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles."
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Without the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200 feet."
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies into 8 pieces each, so the total number of pieces was 5 * 8 = 40 pieces. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26 pieces."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in a single serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 200 grams."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, I will first calculate the total cost of making 20 candles and then subtract the total revenue from selling 20 candles.

Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. Therefore, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Thus, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then the total number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days.

1. **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday.
3. **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

Now, I will calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days.

- **Monday**: 5 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 20 hours
- **Tuesday**: 7 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 28 hours
- **Wednesday**: 14 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 56 hours

Adding these up, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is \( 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 \) hours.

The final numerical answer is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She ended up with 23 Post-it notes remaining.
3. This means she used 80 - 23 = 57 Post-it notes.
4. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used 220 Post-it notes.
5. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased must be the difference between the number of Post-it notes she used and the number she had left, which is 220 - 57 = 163.

The number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[ \$800 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"First, I will convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet of wire is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Next, I will divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day as follows:

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens of eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the daily revenue. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, the daily revenue is:

21 dozens of eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day.

Finally, to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week:

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week.

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know that he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

First, we need to determine the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance he traveled is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for him to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"Uriah's comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Therefore, the remaining weight to be removed from the toys is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To determine the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday, I will first calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The charges are $60 per truck tire and $40 per car tire.

Thursday's revenue:
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The charges are $40 per car tire.

Friday's revenue:
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Now, to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the total revenue of Thursday from the total revenue of Friday.

Difference in revenue:
- Friday's revenue: $480
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Difference: $480 - $520 = -$40

The mechanic earned $40 less on Thursday than on Friday. Therefore, the day with higher revenue is Friday, and the difference in revenue is $40. 

The final numerical answer is $40."

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight the bridge can carry and subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be added, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83. Therefore, the final answer is:

- Number of sour oranges = 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Next, subtract the number of unripe oranges and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - 5 - 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Now, Janet pays 10% of the total cost for insurance:

Insurance cost = 10% of $1300
Insurance cost = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, the total amount Janet paid is the sum of the total cost before insurance and the insurance cost:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Insurance cost
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two different rates of pension payment she is entitled to: the initial rate of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years, and the increased rate of 5% of the pension value after the 20th year.

1. **Calculate the pension value after 20 years:**
   - Marcy's pension is $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
   - The total pension value after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

2. **Calculate the pension value after the 20th year:**
   - Starting from the 21st year, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension after the 20th year is 5% of $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the increased pension rate of $50,000 per year for the remaining 10 years.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the total amount for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The initial amount is $140.
   - The reduced amount is:
     \[
     140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Adding the amounts from the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate the total amount of gas in her tank when it is full. According to the owner's manual, her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. She has already used 4 gallons, so the remaining amount of gas in the tank is:

12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons

Sophia has already traveled 100 miles with the 4 gallons of gas she used. To find out how many miles she can drive per gallon, we divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive with the full tank of 12 gallons, we multiply the number of miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's calculate the time Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, in one session, Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, which totals 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems in the treasure chest, I will calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, I will sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:
\[

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

If there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 36."

Adding these amounts together gives the total money raised:
$129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the interest on the total cost.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much Shiela will pay each month.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost before interest is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

2. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Therefore, the interest on the total cost is:
\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

3. The total amount to be paid, including the interest, is:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

4. Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months, so the amount she will pay each month is:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"To calculate the total amount Artie will make, I will first round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then multiply by the number of pots sold for each type of flower.

Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Now, I will calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, I will add up the total revenue from all the flowers:

Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

Therefore, Artie will make $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, Level 3 will have \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: Level 2 will have half the square footage of Level 3, so it will have \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: Level 1 will have half the square footage of Level 2, so it will have \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level: 16, 8, 4, and 2 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life:
- After the first 180 days, the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life.
- Since the problem does not specify the duration of the puppy's life, we assume the rest of its life is beyond the first year. For the first year, we only need to consider the first 180 days.

Thus, the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is the amount needed for the first 180 days:
\[
180 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, determine how many bags of dog food are needed:
- Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- The number of bags required is:
  \[
  \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636
  \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

   \[
   \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds of laundry}
   \]

3. **Determine how much laundry David does:**
   Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David does:
   \[
   \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds of laundry}
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:**
   The difference is:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, I will first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of the grooming is $100. The discount is 30% of $100.

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original cost:

Cost after discount = $100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"Two girls each got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, so each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \) liters. Therefore, the two girls together got \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) liters of water.

A boy got 6 liters of water.

So, the total amount of water taken is \( 8 + 6 = 14 \) liters.

The amount of water left is \( 24 - 14 = 10 \) liters.

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. 

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

So, 4 times Grace's weight is \( 4 \times 125 = 500 \) pounds. 

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, so Alex's weight is \( 500 - 2 = 498 \) pounds. 

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\( 125 + 498 = 623 \) pounds.

Therefore, their combined weights are 623 pounds. 

\(\boxed{623}\)"

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be denoted as \( W = L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting \( W = L + 8 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost is 7, we can find the number of games they won:
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he has been vacationing since he was 23. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each subsequent vacation, he adds another quilt block. Therefore, for 4 shirts per vacation, he has 11 * 4 = 44 quilt blocks from his 4 vacations. Adding the quilt blocks from the first vacation, the total number of quilt blocks is 44 + 11 = 55. 

The final numerical answer is 55."
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the total number of rings for each alarm instance and then sum them up.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, I will sum the total number of rings:

- First instance: 4 rings
- Second instance: 12 rings
- Third instance: 6 rings

Total number of rings = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The final numerical answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to determine her salary after the initial 5 years of service, which is a 10% increase from her initial salary.

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10%:
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (600 \times 0.10) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Now, we need to calculate her salary after an additional 3 years of service. Since the salary increase is based on the new salary after 5 years, we will apply the 10% increase to $660 for each of the next 3 years.

First, calculate her salary after the 6th year:
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (660 \times 0.10) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

Next, calculate her salary after the 7th year:
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (726 \times 0.10) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Finally, calculate her salary after the 8th year:
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 798.6 + (798.6 \times 0.10) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, let's calculate the number of guests who will attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. 

1/4 of 16 is 4, so 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is 16 - 4 = 12 guests.

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is 12 * .75 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the adults and then by the children.

1. **Calculate the potato salad consumption by adults:**
   - Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total potato salad for adults = 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

2. **Calculate the potato salad consumption by children:**
   - Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total potato salad for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

3. **Calculate the total potato salad needed:**
   - Total potato salad = Potato salad for adults + Potato salad for children
   - Total potato salad = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Amy's age = A
- Jackson's age = J
- Corey's age = C
- James' age = 10

From the information given:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: A = J + 5
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: A = C - 2
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: 10 = C - 1

From the third piece of information, we can solve for Corey's age:
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now, using the second piece of information, we can solve for Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now, using the first piece of information, we can solve for Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles, and then use that information to find out how fast Gerald can now run it.

Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Since Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, we can calculate how fast Gerald used to run it:

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's time (before diet change): 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to his diet. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of Gerald's original time: 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds

Now, subtract this from Gerald's original time to find his new time:

Gerald's new time: 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits can be calculated as:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can sum up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times

"To determine the number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks one glass of water with each meal:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner

He drinks one additional glass of water before he goes to bed.

Therefore, he drinks 4 glasses of water each weekday.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. There are 2 days in the weekend, so he drinks 0 glasses of water on each of those days.

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends, we get:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is therefore:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 3 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 \text{ cubic inches} = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 108 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:

1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 0.5 hour (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the difference between the total hours watched and the hours calculated from the given days is the hours watched on Wednesday:

7 hours (total) - 6 hours (calculated) = 1 hour

Since the 1 hour is a 1-hour episode, the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday is:

1 hour / 0.5 hour per episode = 2 episodes

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 2."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

"To calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to calculate the total cost before the cashback and then subtract the total cashback.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

The cashback is $.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtracting the total cashback from the total cost gives us the final amount after the cashback:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount after the cashback rewards is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, we first calculate the number of roll-ups each of them had.

Marcell's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total number of roll-ups: \(3 \times 14 = 42\)

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total number of roll-ups: \(2 \times 24 = 48\)

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups they both ate together:
- Total roll-ups: \(42 + 48 = 90\)

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average number of roll-ups: \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\)

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore. Since she rows at a speed of \(\frac{5}{4}\) feet per second, the time it takes her to row 64 feet is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second}} = 64 \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{256}{5} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. Since she rows 64 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 6.4 \times 2 = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[ 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Let's separate the final numerical answer in a line:

12.8"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of lessons the whiteboard is used in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned based on the number of lessons and the number of cleanings per lesson.

First, we know that there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. Therefore, the total number of lessons the whiteboard is used in a day is:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 24 \]"

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can find the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6:

\[
\text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
\]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
300 = 50x
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 50:

\[
x = \frac{300}{50} = 6
\]

Thus, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought ten of them at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought five of them at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

Total cost of all lumber = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has ten of them.
- She sells each at the same price as when she bought them, which is $10 each.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has five of them.
- She sells each at the same price as when she bought them, which is $16 each.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

Total revenue from all lumber = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons and cups of water.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now that we have \(x = 6\), we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, which is \(7x\):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[\boxed{42}\]"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, which means he buys a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is 6 * $60 = $360.

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each having 5 vehicles inside. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day was:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day was 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Adrien's salary four years ago and then calculate his salary four years later. We will then find Lylah's salary four years ago and her salary four years later, and finally, we will sum up their salaries.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago to now. Therefore, his current salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \). Then:
   \[
   40000 = L \times 1.3
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]
4. Lylah's salary increased by 40% from four years ago to now. Therefore, her current salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92
   \]
5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, let's break down the information given:

1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than the previous day. So, on Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours, and on Wednesday, she also slept 6 hours.
3. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days. So, on Thursday, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours, on Friday, she slept 7 hours, and on Saturday, she also slept 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept over the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours

"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

After running for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, Rosie has 4 hours left to run at 5 miles per hour. Let's calculate the distance she can run in the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

So, the final numerical answer is 50 miles."
"Let's denote the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began as \( x \).

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) letters.

After stamping, the number of letters needing stamps is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

We are told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began plus the 20 letters she stamped equals 30.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 30 - 20 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is 10."
"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Julia initially had some number of spoons, but we don't know how many. After buying the package, she had \( x \) spoons. Her husband then gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x + 5 \) spoons. While Julia was making the stew, she used 3 spoons, so she had \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \) spoons left. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \( 10 \). 

\(\boxed{10}\)"

"To solve this problem, I will first determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as 15$.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Three times the cost of a pepper, so 3 * 15$ = 45$.
3. **Cost of an orange**: 5 less than the cost of a watermelon, so 45$ - 5$ = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying:

- **Total cost for watermelons**: 4 watermelons * 45$ = 180$.
- **Total cost for peppers**: 20 peppers * 15$ = 300$.
- **Total cost for oranges**: 10 oranges * 40$ = 400$.

Finally, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the above costs:

- Total cost = 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880$."
"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients' visits:

1. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
2. The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
3. Therefore, the revenue from each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.
4. With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the doctors' services:

1. Each doctor is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
2. The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
3. Therefore, the cost to the hospital from each doctor is $150 * 0.4 = $60.
4. With 500 patients a day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

1. Total revenue = $40,000
2. Total cost = $30,000
3. Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. W = 2B (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. B = 2Q (There are twice as many baby bees as queens)
3. W + B + Q = 700 (The total number of bees is 700)

From the second relationship, we can express B in terms of Q:
B = 2Q

From the first relationship, we can express W in terms of B:
W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q

Now, substituting B and W in terms of Q into the third relationship:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens (Q), we can find the number of baby bees (B) and worker bees (W):
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles of bleach. The total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs of cloths.

The cost of the bleach is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32. The cost of the cloths is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40. Therefore, the total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To calculate the number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year.

Second, since there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ harvests/year} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4000."
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces to find the total number of lego pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

Therefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return to the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 3 sets of 6 hours return to the hive. This means all 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours, all 15 bees that returned in the next 6 hours, and all 60 bees that returned in the next 6 hours.

So, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that returned in the next two 6-hour periods:

30 (first 6 hours) + 15 (second 6 hours) + 60 (third 6 hours) = 105 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 105."
"The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22. Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received. Thus, the amount of money she gave the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has on Facebook. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To calculate the earnings, we need to determine the total cost of inflating the tires for all the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 10 tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 9 tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, so there is 1 * 1 = 1 tire to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 1 tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, we sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- Total cost in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
- Carl buys ten packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains six cookies.

Total number of cookies = 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Carl buys 60 cookies.

Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00.

Finally, let's calculate the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.00.

Change received = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
$4.00"
"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon stole the fries, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.

2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate the fries, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.

3. Dave ate fourteen fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate the fries, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.

Therefore, the pack of fries that Dave bought originally contained 45 fries."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the weekly hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both groups of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays + hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Total weekly hours = 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Finally, we calculate the total hours for the entire semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- Total semester hours = total weekly hours \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total semester hours = 17 \(\times\) 16 = 272 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours."
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this purpose.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls every day. Therefore, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants every day. Therefore, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day. Therefore, the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together to get the total length in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[ 280 \text{ feet} \]

Let me now present the final numerical answer in a separate line:
\[ 280 \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in the zoo over that period.

First, let's calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we sum the monthly requirements:
\[
200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month}
\]

Now, we need to find the total requirement for 2 months:
\[
700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 1 \times 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Comparing the distances, Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. When 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. Then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"On Tuesday, the depth of the water in the tank was 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is 24 feet * (2/3) = 16 feet.

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we will first calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin and then sum up all the fish caught by both.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, we will sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Total starfish:
- Anakin: 10
- Locsin: 5
- Total: \(10 + 5 = 15\)

Total sea horses:
- Anakin: 6
- Locsin: 3
- Total: \(6 + 3 = 9\)

Total clownfish:
- Anakin: 3
- Locsin: 5
- Total: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught:
- Total starfish: 15
- Total sea horses: 9
- Total clownfish: 8
- Total fish: \(15 + 9 + 8 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 32."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the price increase every two months and then apply it for the total period of 36 months.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. So, the increase in price every two months is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

Therefore, the price after two months will be:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]

The price increases by 4 every two months. To find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the number of price increases in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, there will be:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]
price increases in 36 months.

Each price increase is 4 dollars, so the total increase in price after 36 months will be:
\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Adding this total increase to the original price, the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months will be:
\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 92 \]"
"To solve this, let's first establish the cost of the red car and the doll based on the information given.

1. One red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. An action figure costs $5.

From point 2, we can calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since one red car costs $4 and one red car is equivalent to 3 action figures, we can deduce that one action figure costs $4/3.
- Therefore, the doll, which costs as much as 3 action figures, would cost $4.

Now, let's calculate the total value of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars * $4/car = $20
- Action figures: 3 figures * $4/3/figure = $4
- Doll: $4

Adding these values together:
- Total value = $20 (red cars) + $4 (action figures) + $4 (doll) = $28

Thus, the total value of all the toys is $28."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour from freelance work if she does her taxes herself. If we assume she works 1 hour on her taxes, the missed income is $35. If she hires an accountant, she pays $90.

The difference in cost between doing her taxes herself and hiring an accountant is:
$90 - $35 = $55

Therefore, Jackie will have $55 more if she hires the accountant."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €991."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs \(15 \times 3 = 45\) eggs. Since she receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, she needs to babysit \(45 \div 9 = 5\) times. 

The final numerical answer is 5."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is $8 * 2 = $16. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking pattern:

- He walks 20 miles a day for 5 days a week (Monday through Friday).
- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day.

So, the total miles walked during the weekdays is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

And the total miles walked during the weekends is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each component of the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to multiply the number of each type of creature by the number of legs they have and then add all the results together.

For the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

For the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, we add all these together:
640 legs (from spiders) + 540 legs (from insects) + 30 legs (from invertebrates) = 1210 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of the birds based on the information provided:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of the four birds:

Sally Two: 19 years
Granny Red: 16 years
Sally Four: 8 years
Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years

The total age of the four birds is 51 years."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the amount she pays each month and then multiply that by 12 to get the annual payment.

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300/month
   - 50% more than the minimum: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200/month
   - 50% more than the minimum: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500/month
   - 50% more than the minimum: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Now, we add up the monthly payments for all debts:
- Student loans: $450/month
- Credit card: $300/month
- Mortgage: $750/month

Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

Finally, to find the annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
- Annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months = $18000/year

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to peel and cut all 60 potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel and cut each potato.

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, let's convert the time to peel one potato into seconds:
1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:
90 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

Next, let's calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:
5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Finally, let's add the total time to peel and cut all the potatoes:
5400 seconds (peeling) + 300 seconds (cutting) = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time back into minutes:
5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost Juan and Carlos spent on lemons given their profit and the cost of ingredients.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:
- They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
- Each glass is sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = \$10 \).

Next, we know their profit is $25. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \).

The profit equation is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in our interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the cost components.

The total cost \( C \) includes:
- Cost of lemons: \( 3 \) dollars per gallon
- Cost of sugar: \( 2 \) dollars per gallon

Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 3x + 2x = 5x \]

Given the profit is $25, we have:
\[ 25 = 10 - 5x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 5x = 10 - 25 \]
\[ 5x = -15 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

Since \( x \) cannot be negative, we need to recheck the problem statement and calculations. The negative value suggests an error in the profit calculation or the given values. However, if we assume the profit is correctly given as $25, then the cost calculation should be re-evaluated.

Given the correct profit and revenue, the cost of lemons alone can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3x \]

Since \( x = 3 \) (correcting the negative value to a positive one):
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."

1. Rent: 1/4 of his salary = 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
2. Car fuel: 1/3 of his salary = 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
3. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$
4. Donation to charity: 1/2 of the remaining amount = 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
5. Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
6. Amount given to daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900$
7. Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife: 1250 - 900 = 350$

Therefore, the final amount Zaid will still have is 350$."
"To solve the problem, let's first determine the number of crabs each person has.

1. **Bo's Crabs:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's Crabs:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Rani's Crabs:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Total Crabs:**
   To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we sum the crabs of Rani, Monic, and Bo.
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = 46 + 36 + 40
   \]

5. **Calculation:**
   \[
   46 + 36 = 82

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4W \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5W = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( W \):
\[ 5W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"If Jan is 30 years old, then two years ago Jan was 28 years old.

Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, so Mark was 28 / 2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Therefore, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds less than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds less than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds less than the third). The total time taken by the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( R \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of pieces of straw distributed:

\[ 3R \times 6 + 10 \times 5 + 20 = 160 \]

This equation accounts for the straw given to the rats (3 cages with \( R \) rats each, 6 pieces per rat), the straw given to the hamsters (10 cages with 5 pieces each), and the straw given to the rabbits (20 pieces).

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 18R + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

\[ 18R + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:

\[ 18R = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[ R = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months, including the interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes Benedict is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

First, we calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest for one month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for the second month is calculated on the new principal, which is the initial amount plus the interest from the first month:
\[ \text{New principal after first month} = 100 + 2 = 102 \]
\[ \text{Interest for the second month} = 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

Similarly, the interest for the third month is calculated on the new principal, which is the amount after the second month:
\[ \text{New principal after second month} = 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]
\[ \text{Interest for the third month} = 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

Now, we add up all the interest and the initial amount to find the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + 2 + 2.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ 106.12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106.12 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total cost of transporting \( n \) bags is \( 2n \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for the trader is \( 20n + 2n = 22n \) dollars.

The trader sells all the bags at a rate of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To solve this, let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25
2. **Cost of food**: $4.50 less than the cost of tickets, so $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
3. **Cost of rides**: $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so $33 * 2 = $66

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost of tickets and food: $20.25 + $15.75 = $36
- Total cost of rides: $66
- Total cost: $36 + $66 = $102

They agreed to split all the costs evenly, so each person pays:
- $102 / 3 = $34

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $34."
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute and he collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is 2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck. Since a duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week, we divide this by 7 to find the daily requirement:
   \[
   \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

2. Now, to find out how much insects ten ducks need per day, we multiply the daily requirement for one duck by the number of ducks:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Net increase in trees each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees would be:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die after 10 years, so the number of dead trees is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years:
130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is 6 flamingos. So, they took back 6 flamingos and left 12 flamingos on the yard.
3. The neighbors then painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. Now, there are 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos from Friday plus 18 new pink flamingos, totaling 30 pink flamingos. The number of white flamingos remains 6.

Thus, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of Pokemon cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection:**
   In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Second month collection:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Third month collection:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards collected:**
   To find the total number of cards collected over the three months, we sum the cards collected each month:
   \[
   60 + 40 + 200 = 200
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total collected:
   \[
   20 + 200 = 220
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 220."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

First, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A each week, his earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B each week, his earnings from Publisher B are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find Mark's total earnings for the week, we add his earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- 5% of $2000 is calculated as follows:
  \[
  0.05 \times 2000 = 100
  \]
- Therefore, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
  \[
  2000 + 100 = 2100
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the raise over the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His new weekly salary is $2100.
- Therefore, his total earnings from the raise over the year is:
  \[
  2100 \times 52 = 109200
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from the monetary reward:
- The monetary reward is $5000.
- This reward is given only once at the beginning of the year.

Finally, let's add the total earnings from the raise and the monetary reward to find John's total earnings for the year:
- Total earnings from the raise: $109200
- Total earnings from the monetary reward: $5000
- Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, which is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her first five test scores and then determine the score required on the sixth test.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:

\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). The average of the six test scores will be:

\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} \]

We want this average to be 93, so we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Then, we subtract 440 from both sides:

\[ x = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total kilometers Michael rode his bike is 860 kilometers."
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \text{ grams} \]"

- On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cakes she bought over the three days:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The final numerical answer is 76."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates:
- The cost of one plate is $6000.
- Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
- Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
- Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup:
- Twenty dozen cups means there are \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
- The cost of 240 cups is $34800.
- Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Let's calculate the cost of one cup:
\[
\frac{34800}{240} = 145

- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:

- Sara earns $5 for each babysitting session, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 for each lawn mowing session.

Let's denote the number of times Sara mows the lawn as \( x \). The total money she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * x = $4x.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total money she will have after mowing the lawn is $10 + $4x. We need this amount to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes.

So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 10 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 4x \geq 60 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x \geq 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = R + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected every day can be expressed as:

\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8R = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ W = R + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Total eggs collected:

\[ 3R + 5W = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to determine the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is the perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles, and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. So,

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the second day, Sloane counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers counted on the third day is 500 - 100 - 150 = 250 customers."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the problem constraints and equations. The negative value indicates an inconsistency in the problem setup or interpretation. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the current amount of water in the small pool, we can use the consistent equation \( B = 4S \) and the leak rate to find the current amount of water in the small pool.

Since the pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, the current amount of water in the small pool \( S \) can be found by considering the rate of leakage. If we assume the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago (since it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes), then the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S = (S + 16) - 4 \times 4 \]
\[ S = S + 16 - 16 \]
\[ S = S \]

This confirms the consistency. Now, using \( B = 4S \) and the leak rate, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, and the big pool is losing water at the same rate, we can use the consistent equation to find \( S \).

Given \( B = 4S \) and the leak rate, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S = 16 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work, I will first determine the total cost of her purchase and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the borrowed amount plus an additional 10% of the borrowed amount. The borrowed amount is $2000.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, we can calculate the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old} \]

Harriet is half the age of Zack:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add three years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
\[ \text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \]
\[ \text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \]
\[ \text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages in three years and divide by three:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
5. The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's score is:
   \[
   \text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To calculate the total time Carmen spent playing these games, I will first calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and then on sudoku puzzles, and then add these two times together.

For crossword puzzles:
Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and she solved 3 crossword puzzles.
So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For sudoku puzzles:
Carmen spends 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle and she solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, I will add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles:
30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

"The amount spent on advertising for the first year is $15000. For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is the sum of the amounts spent in each year:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for, and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos: $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji: $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost: $90 + $90 = $180

Therefore, Carlos and Benji will pay $180 for their rentals altogether."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Now, Andrew plans to travel by bus to Rochester and then return from Rochester by car. The total number of days he will travel is the sum of the days for the trip by bus and the days for the return trip by car:

\[
6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days}

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes, and then determine the percentage of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34 (increased by 14)
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32 (decreased by 8)

The total number of cards now is:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The percentage of water type cards is calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage of water type cards} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]
\[ = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito before any upgrades or discounts:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Now, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for upgrading his meal, so we add this to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Watermelons**: The farm initially produced 120 watermelons.

2. **First Harvest**:
   - 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \)
   - Number of watermelons not ready for harvest: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \)

3. **Second Harvest**:
   - Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \)
   - Number of watermelons not ready for harvest: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \)

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"First, I will calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees.

Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars:
\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, I will calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%:
\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, I will add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, I will calculate the total registration fees. Each car costs $1,000 for registration:
\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, I will add the total cost of the cars (including tax) to the total registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays:
\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Mark pays is:
\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"If there were 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Thus, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, let's determine the number of penguins that jump into the ocean. One-third of the 36 penguins jump in, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12

Next, let's determine the number of penguins that go into the cave. Another one-third of the 36 penguins go into the cave, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

Now, let's find the total number of penguins that have either gone into the ocean or the cave. This is the sum of the penguins that went into the ocean and the penguins that went into the cave:

\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]

Finally, to find the number of penguins that are still left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that went into the ocean or the cave from the original number of penguins:

\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week): 9 * 7 = 63 cherry tomatoes per week.

A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total weekly consumption by the weekly production of a vine: 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He can make one new pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new pen.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we divide the number of empty pens by five:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{\text{Number of empty pens}}{5} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens.

3. Now, we add the original pens to the new pens he made:

\[ \text{Total pens} = \text{Original pens} + \text{New pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram has is 30."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, Robert has:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James."

"Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them, so he is now penpals with 5 - 2 = 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is 3 * 10 = 30 pages. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Thus, Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing a week."
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for his boss's calls is:
  \[
  15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}

Thus, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write the equation as:

\[ 32 - 4 = 2F \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 2F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[ F = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 14."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.
2. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
3. Apply the 10% discount.
4. Calculate the final amount Jean pays.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.
- She requires 6 hours each day.
- She needs it done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost before the discount.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Step 3: Apply the 10% discount.
- The discount is 10%, so the artist keeps 90% of the total cost.

Discounted cost = $30,000 * 0.90 = $27,000

Step 4: The final amount Jean pays is the discounted cost.

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays is $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, I will first calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies and then divide that total by three, since she split the cost evenly with her two parents.

The total amount spent is:
$12 (ingredients) + $43 (birthday presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now, I will divide the total amount by three to find out how much each person paid:
$96 / 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"First, I will calculate the total weight of the onions the chef bought. Since the chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, I will calculate the total cost of the onions. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50 \text{ per pound} = \$300 \]

Therefore, the chef spent $300."
"To solve this, let's first determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)

Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Each cookie has 200 calories, so we can calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the sister's total calories from Sue's total calories.

Difference in calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.

Given that each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

The first class has 20 students and 15 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

The second class has 20 students and 12 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first and second classes from the total number of boys in the school:
\[ 30 - 5 - 8 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 17 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

17"
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had 61 - 9 = 52 apps left. After downloading 18 more apps, he added 18 to the 52 he had, resulting in 52 + 18 = 70 apps. Therefore, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( W_1 \) be the number of wolves killed last night.
- Let \( C_1 \) be the number of cougars killed last night.
- Let \( W_2 \) be the number of wolves killed today.
- Let \( C_2 \) be the number of cougars killed today.

From the problem, we know:
- \( W_1 = 10 \)
- \( C_1 = 15 \)
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \( W_2 = 3C_2 \)
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night: \( C_2 = C_1 - 3 \)

First, we calculate \( C_2 \):
\[ C_2 = C_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate \( W_2 \):
\[ W_2 = 3C_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( W_1 = 10 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( W_2 = 36 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( C_1 = 15 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( C_2 = 12 \)

Total number of animals killed:
\[ \text{Total} = W_1 + W_2 + C_1 + C_2 = 10 + 36 + 15 + 12 = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals killed by Rick is:
\[ 73 \]"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find the floor he ends up on, we calculate: \(4 \times 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18\).

Therefore, Bill is on the 18th floor now.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to 10 * 20 = 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows from the new purchase.

Therefore, each stall now has 20 (original cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 176."
"To calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to sum the value of each type of coin and bill.

1. Pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00
2. Nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00
3. Dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.00
4. Dollar bills: 40 pieces * $1.00/piece = $40.00

Adding these amounts together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage by termites.

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the entire 200-foot redwood tree is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, so 70% of the wood remains. 

\[ \text{Weight remaining} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is 5600 pounds."
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. Therefore, the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book overdue, which is $2.00.

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can determine the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from Andrea's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to the number of apples Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which we can verify by checking:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]

Adding these together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the number of cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \text{Cups of flour} = \frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies per dozen}} \times 2 \text{ cups per dozen} \]

Simplifying the above expression:
\[ \text{Cups of flour} = \frac{66}{12} \times 2 = 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, Carla will need:
\[ \boxed{11} \text{ cups of flour} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6,200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, which totals to 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. After getting 20 more marbles from her friend, she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

"First, let's determine the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees in Harry's yard} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, Harry's yard has 8 more trees than Ferdinand's yard. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400."
"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, I will first calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then subtract her budget from this total.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

The total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee is:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Now, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees and the brokerage fee from the selling price, and then subtract the remaining loan amount he paid.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees:
Transfer fees = 3% of $400 000 = 0.03 * $400 000 = $12 000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400 000 = 0.05 * $400 000 = $20 000

Now, let's subtract the transfer fees and the brokerage fee from the selling price:
Amount after fees = $400 000 - $12 000 - $20 000 = $368 000

Finally, we subtract the $250 000 loan amount he paid:
Net proceeds = $368 000 - $250 000 = $118 000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118 000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. The time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
Cost of newspaper ads = Number of newspaper ads * Cost per newspaper ad
Cost of newspaper ads = 50 * $5
Cost of newspaper ads = $250

The cost of the television ads is calculated as follows:
Cost of television ads = Number of television ads * Cost per television ad
Cost of television ads = 15 * $75
Cost of television ads = $1125

Now, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
Total amount spent = $250 + $1125
Total amount spent = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, I will calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, I will sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 (first bag) + 312 (second bag) + 150 (third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To calculate the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Next, we add the additional windows:
- Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

Now, we calculate the total number of windows in one house:
- Windows in bedrooms: 6
- Additional windows: 4
- Total windows in one house: \(6 + 4 = 10\)

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
- Total windows in 2 houses: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, I will first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170
   \]

4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the two sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

5. Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Thus, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 315."

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   Adding the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene, we get:

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D on them, are 9. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ 9 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, I will first calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

For small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, I will add the total time for small holes and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To solve this problem, I will use the information given and apply the rules of arithmetic.

Mico and Marco's current combined age is 20 years. 

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we can calculate the sum of their ages in 10 years by adding 10 years to each of their current ages and then summing the results.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). We know that:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 \]
\[ M + R + 20 \]

Since we know that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 20 + 20 \]
\[ 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, in 9 years:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"First, I will calculate the cost of the popsicles and then the cost of the ice cream bars, and finally add these two amounts together to find the total cost.

The cost of the popsicles is:
20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00

The cost of the ice cream bars is:
4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00

$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7.00."
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding the total spots of the cobras and mambas together gives:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests.

The total number of people is:
12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people.

Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:
13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in the necklace.

Given:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Each necklace uses 8 topaz gemstones.

Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the remaining length of the necklace that is filled with sterling silver beads. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches. Thus, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ 68 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 68 \]"
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. Therefore, Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories, Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories, and Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:

- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these totals together, we get \(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\) stories.

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is twice her age, so if Ann is 9 years old, her brother is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old. In 3 years, her brother will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

"Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equal to 5 * 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equal to 2 * 10 = 20 cents. Therefore, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left. 

The final numerical answer is 90."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, which totals:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each, which totals:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, we subtract the stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:
\[ 76 - 24 - 12 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each of these remaining rows has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and has traveled a total of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is:

\[ \text{Speed}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same 480 miles, we use the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 17 medals, so together they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.
3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

The total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The number of chocolate bars for the adults is 24.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left for the children is \(40 - 24 = 16\).

Finally, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 16 chocolate bars left.
- There are 8 children, so each child will get \(16 \div 8 = 2\) chocolate bars.

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate how much money Susan earns, we need to determine the total time she works and then calculate her earnings based on her rate of earning.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, we subtract this from the total time to find out how much time she actually works:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to convert the working time into minutes because Susan earns money every 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's calculate the points for each player after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's consider the fourth round. In this round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point, and his total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's sum up the points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike has 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 43 points.

The total points for all three players is \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 83."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The sons together washed as many oranges as their combined ages. So, the total number of oranges washed is 8 + 4 = 12.

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons washed 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 3."

On the second day, he did:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total for the two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of rice consumed per week and then calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members of the household:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 5 \, \text{members} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Finally, we determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many crates of bread Sam was off from his target, I will first calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, he sold 12 crates, and on Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Let's add up the crates sold during the days he was open:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering the sequence of bids and the increments.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   Carmen's initial bid is $200.

2. **Bids from Others:**
   There are 3 other people who each bid once. Each of these bids is $50 higher than the previous bid.

   - The first other person's bid: $200 + $50 = $250
   - The second other person's bid: $250 + $50 = $300
   - The third other person's bid: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people. Therefore, she bids on the $350 bid.

   - Carmen's first bid: $350 + $50 = $400
   - Carmen's second bid: $400 + $50 = $450
   - Carmen's third bid: $450 + $50 = $500
   - Carmen's fourth bid: $500 + $50 = $550

4. **Final Bid:**
   Carmen's final bid is the fourth bid, which is $550.

Thus, the total amount Carmen spent to win the desk is the sum of all her bids:

\[
200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 450 + 500 + 550
\]

Let's calculate this sum step by step:

\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750
\]
\[
750 + 350 = 1100
\]
\[
1100 + 400 = 1500
\]
\[
1500 + 450 = 1950
\]
\[
1950 + 500 = 2450

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives the driver in a year:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for driving."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
16 minutes (Monday) + 23 minutes (Sunday) = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 78."

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the current year.
3. Calculate the total number of books sold in the first and second years.
4. Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year.

First, let's find the number of books sold in the first year. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Next, we know the total number of books is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first and second years combined is \(250 - 50 = 200\). Since 90 books were sold in the first year, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 90 = 110\).

Now, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so the total amount earned in the second year is \(110 \times 20 = 2200\).

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{2200}\)."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week.
- He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.
- Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

So, his total weekly earnings are $500 + $300 = $800.

Next, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and assuming the company performed well every week, we need to calculate his earnings for 4 full weeks and the first 2 days of the 5th week.

- For 4 full weeks, his earnings are 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200.
- For the first 2 days of the 5th week, he works 2 days * 10 hours/day = 20 hours, so his earnings for those 2 days are 20 hours * $10/hour = $200.

Adding these together, his total earnings for April are $3200 + $200 = $3400.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
3400"
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

4"
"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
- The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:
\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:
\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Joey loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Thus, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. The final numerical answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the savings on the ice cream and then on the milk, and finally add the savings together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, to find the total savings, we add the savings on the ice cream and the savings on the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

Therefore, the total savings if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The serum grows an extra arm every three days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 3, which is 5.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The serum grows an extra leg every five days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 5, which is 3.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Extra arms: 5
- Extra legs: 3
- Total new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend is:
Total amount - Amount to save = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, we subtract the total costs from the amount he can spend:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total costs = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's determine the daily egg consumption for the family:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs per day.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption:
- Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Then, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) and the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for those who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for those who had previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to the store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles Solomon added to the store is:
\[ 20 + 50 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to find the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) to fill the pool is:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, and the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and knowing that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can find the number of electric poles by setting up a proportion.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:

\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can cross-multiply:

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men out of the 40 people who were there initially must have stayed. Therefore, the number of men who left is 40 - 22 = 18 men.

Since 10 people in total left, and 18 men left, this means that 10 - 18 = -8 men left, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the interpretation of the question. The correct interpretation should be that 22 men stayed, so 40 - 22 = 18 men left, and since 10 people in total left, 10 - 18 = -8 men left is not possible, but we know that 18 men left, so the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which again indicates an error in the question's setup.

Given the question's setup, if 22 men stayed, then 18 men left, and since 10 people in total left, the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. However, if we consider the total number of people who left (10) and the number of men who left (18), the number of women who left must be recalculated based on the total number of people who left.

Since 18 men left, and 10 people in total left, the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the question's setup. If we assume the question meant to say that 18 men left and 22 men stayed, then the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. 

Given the constraints of the question, the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. 

However, if we consider the total number of people who left (10) and the number of men who left (18), the number of women who left must be recalculated based on the total number of people who left. Since 18 men left, and 10 people in total left, the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. 

Therefore, the correct answer, considering the constraints of the question, is that the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible. 

The final numerical answer, considering the constraints and the logical flow of the question, is 0 women left, as the number of women who left cannot be negative."
"A magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. Therefore, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1. 

The final numerical answer is $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Since Jam has three boxes, the total number of pencils Jam has is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the 2 loose pencils to the 24 pencils in the boxes to get the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first add the total number of pencils they have:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effect of the cooling and the added liquid separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee; it simply adds more liquid. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is still 60 milliliters weaker.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]

Shannon’s iced coffee is 60 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 7 * 2 = 14. 

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are told that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. He then buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the 8 lollipops he had left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats a total of 3 + 2 = 5 lollipops. Subtracting these from the 36 lollipops, Oscar has 36 - 5 = 31 lollipops. 

The final numerical answer is 31."
"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charge. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. 

To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from the full charge: 100% - 60% = 40%.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to fully charge the phone.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60: 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has:

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Rewards Calculation for the First Trip:**
   - The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they would get $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Rewards Application for the Second Trip:**
   - The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.
   - They used the $8 rewards from their last trip.
   - The coupon applied to the price is twice the amount of rewards, so the coupon is $16 (since $8 * 2 = $16).

3. **Calculating the Final Price Paid:**
   - The customer spent $43.
   - They used $8 in rewards.
   - They used a $16 coupon.
   - Therefore, the total amount deducted from the $43 is $8 + $16 = $24.
   - The final price paid is $43 - $24 = $19.

Thus, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

For Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Total state tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income before property tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Net income tax rate: 10%
- Total net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay rates:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles:
   - 40 percent of 220 castles are ruined.
   - 40% of 220 = 0.40 * 220 = 88 ruined castles.

2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Half of 88 ruined castles = 0.5 * 88 = 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, I will first calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each
- Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
- Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350) = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
- Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, to find the cost difference:
- Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
- Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To share the paintball guns equally, we first need to determine the total number of guns they have together.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns.

To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns."

Therefore, the total amount of sugar needed is 310 ounces."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year.
2. Calculate the value of Maria's shares after the second year.

Step 1: Calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year.
Maria initially bought 8 shares at $8 each, so the total value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

Step 2: Calculate the value of Maria's shares after the second year.
In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 72 \]"
"Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs. 

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is 1."
"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:

\[ \text{Total number of legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). Therefore, the total number of balls he would have is 3 (initial) + 4 (added) = 7 balls. However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls, 2 of which are caught by people in the crowd and 1 is lost. Thus, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is 7 - 3 = 4 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and 10 pounds less than a yellow snake. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, a blue beetle and a green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.
2. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird. Therefore, a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we add the weights of the animals and the weight of the container:
- Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds

Therefore, the total weight is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

The final numerical answer is 260."
"To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we will add the outfits she received from her friend, her baby shower, and her mom.

First, Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of outfits her friend gave her. Therefore, the number of outfits she received at the baby shower is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Next, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add all the outfits together:
\[ 24 \text{ (from her friend)} + 48 \text{ (from the baby shower)} + 15 \text{ (from her mom)} \]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]

"To calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to determine how many meters he runs each day after taking his coach's advice.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters a day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. To find out how much more he should run, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson should run an additional 1000 meters each day. Therefore, the total distance he runs each day now is:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days. To find the total distance Tyson runs in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

- Juice Box C costs 11 dollars, and Juice Box B costs 9 dollars, so Juice Box C costs 11 - 9 = 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

The final numerical answer is 2 dollars."

40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Adding these together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a week.

1. **Total number of cookies in a week:**
   - Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.
   - Each bag contains 36 cookies.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies in a week is 36.

2. **Cookies consumed by her son:**
   - Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies her son consumes in a week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week}
     \]

3. **Cookies consumed by her husband:**
   - Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies her husband consumes in a week is:
     \[
     1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week}
     \]

4. **Total cookies consumed by her son and husband:**
   - Sum the cookies consumed by her son and her husband:
     \[
     20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week}
     \]

5. **Cookies left for Jenny to eat:**
   - Subtract the total cookies consumed by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in a week:
     \[
     36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week}

"To calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount.

Step 1: Total cost without discount
The cost of one shirt is $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = 2 * $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount
The discount is 40%, so the discount amount is 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount
Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Total cost with discount = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts with the discount."
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money made per day, we first need to calculate the daily earnings from tractors and silos.

When they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, they make silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find the percentage increase in the amount of money made per day, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]"

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Madeline spends $25 per week on food.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is $25 * 4 = $100.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $120.

5. **Total Yearly Cost:**
   - Yearly cost = Total monthly cost * 12
   - Yearly cost = $120 * 12 = $1440.

Therefore, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"To calculate the total time of all Peyton's after-work activities, I will first determine the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours

Now, I will sum up the durations:

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours for all of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of plant pots needed for the daisies and roses.

For the daisies, the school asked for 30 plant pots.
For the roses, they asked for twice as many as the daisies, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots needed is \(30 + 60 = 90\).

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center.

To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought:

\(100 - 90 = 10\)

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is 10."
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

Andrea started with $36. She spent some money on a sweater and gave some to her brother. The total amount spent on the sweater and given to her brother is $11 + $4 = $15.

Therefore, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ 36 - S - 15 = 0 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ 36 - 15 = S \]
\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating: 6 hours
Swimming: Half the time spent boating, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Total time spent on boating and swimming: 6 + 3 = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The shows and boating/swimming together make up 30% of the total time spent on his vacation. Therefore, the total time spent on his vacation is:

6 hours (shows) + 9 hours (boating and swimming) = 15 hours
15 hours is 30% of the total time spent on his vacation.

Let's denote the total time spent on his vacation as T. Then we have:

15 hours = 0.30 * T

To find T, we divide both sides by 0.30:

T = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

0.40 * T = 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours

So, the time John spent sightseeing is 20 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the earnings from both jobs to find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs:
\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. Adding the money she will earn from her jobs to her current savings gives:
\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

- Dean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2, so the total cost for the toy cars is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- Dean bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1, so the total cost for the teddy bears is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the toys is \(12 + 5 = 17\) dollars.

Dean's mother initially gave him $28, and he spent $17 on toys, so the amount of money Dean has left after buying the toys is \(28 - 17 = 11\) dollars.

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10, so Dean's total money becomes \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has is 21 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to subtract the costs of the activities she wants to do from her total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the activities she wants to do:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
- She also wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.

Now, let's add up these costs:
- Cost of mini-golf: $5
- Cost of go-karts: $20
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5

Total cost = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money is left for her and her friends:
- Total budget: $90
- Total cost: $30

Money left = $90 - $30 = $60

Since she wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, we need to subtract the cost of one round of mini-golf from the remaining money:
- Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5

Money left after one round of mini-golf = $60 - $5 = $55

Now, we need to determine how many friends she can invite. Each friend will get $5 in arcade tokens, so we divide the remaining money by $5:
- Money left: $55
- Cost per friend: $5

Number of friends = $55 / $5 = 11

Therefore, she can invite 11 friends to her birthday party."
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the lollipops.
2. Calculate the daily change Marisa saves.
3. Calculate the total savings over 5 days.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of the lollipops:
- Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents, which is equivalent to $0.25.
- Therefore, the cost of 4 lollipops is \(4 \times 0.25 = 1.00\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily change Marisa saves:
- Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.
- The cost of the lollipops is $1.00.
- Therefore, the daily change she saves is \(5.00 - 1.00 = 4.00\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total savings over 5 days:
- Marisa saves $4.00 each day.
- Over 5 days, she saves \(4.00 \times 5 = 20.00\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:
\[
\boxed{20.00}
\]"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Billy started with $10 and spent it on candy. After buying candy, he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This means Billy had $8 left after buying the candy (since he spent half of his remaining $10 on gumballs).

2. **Calculate the cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Since he had $8 left after buying the candy, the cost of the candy is:
   \[
   10 - 8 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds Billy bought, we divide the total cost of the candy by the cost per pound:
   \[
   \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds of candy, which is approximately 1.33 pounds.

\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}

"To find the age of Carver's son, let's denote the son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

\(\boxed{25}\)"
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city, which is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance at which the train needs service, which is 18,000 miles.

So, the number of days between services is:
675 / 18,000 = 0.0375 days.

Since the question asks for the number of days between services, the final numerical answer is 0.0375 days."
"To determine the amount of stuffing Mark needs, I will first calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed, and then calculate the total for the chihuahua and collie beds.

A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.

The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and the Chihuahua beds. Therefore, the stuffing for a collie bed is:
\[
\frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the total stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:
\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per chihuahua bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per collie bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To solve this problem, I will break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each segment of the trip.

1. **Initial Trip to Friend's House:**
   - Distance: 200 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours

2. **Detour:**
   - Additional Distance: 10 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.143 hours

3. **Trip Home:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, I will add up the times for all segments to get the total trip time.

- Total Time = Time to Friend's House + Time for Detour + Time Home
- Total Time = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours + 3 hours = 5.000 hours

The total trip took 5 hours."
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent. Since the total number of absentees is 5 girls and 4 boys, the number of absent boys is 4. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then the number of boys is 6 * 2 = 12 boys.

"To pass to the next school year, Jane must score a total of at least 42 points across her three tests. She has already scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. 

Let's calculate the total points she has scored so far:
15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33 points.

To find out the minimum score she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required:
42 (total required) - 33 (points already scored) = 9 points.

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"To solve this problem, I will follow the steps outlined:

1. Let the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of shoplifters \( y \) is:
   \[
   y = 4x - 5
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]

3. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, the number of people for physical violence \( z \) is:
   \[
   z = 3y
   \]
   Substituting \( y = 7 \):
   \[
   z = 3(7) = 21
   \]

4. The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is given as 50. We can now calculate the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of customers for refusing to wear masks, shoplifters, and those for physical violence from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for other reasons} = 50 - (x + y + z)
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \), \( y = 7 \), and \( z = 21 \):
   \[
   \text{Number of people for other reasons} = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19

"To determine the total cost of making one's own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. 

First, calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means the DIY option saves $80. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper would be:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Thus, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount sold on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.

Six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

To find the total number of pairs sold over the weekend, we add the pairs sold on each day: \(14 + 28 + 8 = 48\) pairs.

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 48."

"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Let's denote the total number of pieces as \( N \). Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

Step 2: Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces, which is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.
The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the cost is distributed proportionally to the number of pieces, the cost of the functioning pieces is \( 0.6 \times 400,000 \).

"First, let's determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed. A pair of socks consists of 2 socks.

She has washed 10 pairs of socks, which means she has washed:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment for a loan with a principal of $3,650, a term of five months, and an interest rate of 10%.

First, let's calculate the total interest:
- The interest rate is 10% per year, which is 0.10 per year.
- The loan term is five months, which is 5/12 of a year.
- The total interest for the loan is $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167 = $152.50.

The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
- Total amount to be repaid = $3,650 + $152.50 = $3,802.50.

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
- Monthly payment = $3,802.50 / 5 = $760.50.

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month."

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Axel's friend Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is:

36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Now, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue to find the profit:

$36 - $18 = $18

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of cups sold per hour:

$18 / 4 cups/hour = $4.50/hour

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is $4.50."
"Let's denote the total land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \) hectares.

Given that he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he was left with \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land.

So, \( \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \) hectares.

To find \( L \), we can set up the equation and solve for \( L \):

\[ \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \]

Multiplying both sides by \( \frac{5}{2} \) to isolate \( L \):

\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ L = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ L = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is split evenly between boys and girls, the number of boys is also:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 26
\]

When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
\]

This means the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can make it} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we first need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost for both David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which includes 9 rides.
- Therefore, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Dasha buys tickets to ride all 9 rides.
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost for one ride is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- For 9 rides, the total cost is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in their costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30
- The amount David saves is \(36 - 30 = 6\) dollars.

Thus, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, I will first calculate the total number of gift bows she needs to make and then divide the total inches of ribbon by this number.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Therefore, the total number of gift bows she needs to make is:

6 (family gifts) + 4 (friends gifts) + 2 (teachers gifts) = 12 gift bows.

She has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the gift bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gift bows:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gift bows = 12 inches of ribbon per gift bow.

Thus, the number of inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow is 12 inches."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually, and then find the difference between the number of popsicles they have.

Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles is 165, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( B \) be the number of popsicles Betty has, and \( S \) be the number of popsicles Sam has. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ B : S = 5 : 6 \]

This can be written as:
\[ B = 5x \]
\[ S = 6x \]

The total number of popsicles is:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 5x + 6x = 165 \]
\[ 11x = 165 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{165}{11} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
\[ B = 5x = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
\[ S = 6x = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to first determine the total cost of the streaming services he will be using.

1. **Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Hulu**: Normally $10 per month, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost is reduced to $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8 per month.
3. **Disney Plus**: Normally $10 per month, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost is reduced to $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

Now, we add the monthly costs of the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total cost of streaming services per month = $10 + $8 + $8 = $26.

Tim's cable package cost $60 per month. Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves per month by switching to streaming services is:
- Cable package cost: $60
- Streaming services cost: $26

Savings per month = $60 - $26 = $34.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. I will use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = 240 (writing) + 120 (recording) + 90 (editing) = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of spaces available in the shelving system, and then determine how many books Wendy needs to place.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. Let's denote the number of books Wendy wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, this number is 20 more than double the number of spaces in the shelving system:

"To calculate the builder's earnings for a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

First, the builder works for 6 days every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the builder works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.

Next, to find out how many days the builder works in a year, we multiply the number of days worked in a month by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the builder works for 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, his total earnings for the year would be 288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year.

Thus, the final numerical answer is $14,400."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to multiply the quantities of flour and milk by 4.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups

Now, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour:
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
- For 12 cups of flour, Mark needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

Milk:
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
- For 4 cups of milk, Mark needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

- Bags of flour: 6

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original conditions and then under the reduced conditions. Finally, I will find the difference in energy consumption over 30 days.

Under the original conditions:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
- It is used for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily energy consumption is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.
- To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000, so the daily energy consumption is 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

Under the reduced conditions:
- The air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).
- The daily energy consumption is 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.
- Converting to kilowatt-hours, the daily energy consumption is 2.7 kilowatt-hours.

Now, to find the energy saved in 30 days:
- The energy saved per day is 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.
- Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

Therefore, the number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours."

- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, I will add up all the stripes:
\(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes

There are a total of 4 zebras, so the average number of stripes is:
\(88 / 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the total number of sandwiches needed, then calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required, and finally, the total cost.

Tyson needs to serve 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches needed is:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding these costs together gives the total amount Tyson would spend:

"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of corns Allan has.
2. Calculate the number of cannolis after he bought more.
3. Determine the number of corns he bought.
4. Calculate the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has now.

Step 1: Initial number of corns
Given that there is twice as much corn as cannolis, and Allan initially has 40 cannolis:
\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Step 2: Number of cannolis after buying more
Allan bought 60 more cannolis:
\[ \text{Total cannolis after buying} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Step 3: Number of corns bought
Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying:
\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Step 4: Total number of corns and cannolis
Now, we add the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
\[ \text{Total corns} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]
\[ \text{Total cannolis} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Combined total} = 140 + 100 = 240 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 240."

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, let's determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it will take to read the book is:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby plans to leave the place where he is reading the book as soon as he finishes the book. It takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read the book until he reaches the airport is:
30 minutes (to finish the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees who worked in May.
2. Calculate the total number of employees who worked in June.
3. Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in May.
4. Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in June.
5. Sum the amounts from May and June to get the total amount paid.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Total number of employees in May:**
   - Carolyn hired 40 employees in May.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees in May is 40.

2. **Total number of employees in June:**
   - In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
   - 1/4 of 40 employees is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) employees.
   - Therefore, 30 employees' contracts did not expire in June.
   - The total number of employees in June is 30.

3. **Total amount of money paid to the employees in May:**
   - Each employee works 40 hours per week.
   - Each employee is paid $15 per hour.
   - Therefore, each employee is paid \( 40 \times 15 = 600 \) dollars per week.
   - The total amount paid to all employees in May is \( 40 \times 600 = 24000 \) dollars.

4. **Total amount of money paid to the employees in June:**
   - Each of the 30 employees works 40 hours per week.
   - Each employee is paid $15 per hour.
   - Therefore, each employee is paid \( 40 \times 15 = 600 \) dollars per week.
   - The total amount paid to all employees in June is \( 30 \times 600 = 18000 \) dollars.

5. **Total amount of money paid to the employees in the two months:**
   - The total amount paid in May and June is \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a special deal: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 3 - 1.50 = 1.50). Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, so she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is:

\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:

\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10 she was given:

\[ 10.00 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"First, I will calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. Each pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, I will apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, the discounted cost of the two packs is:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, I will add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packs of fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 1110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples, which is 15, from the shortest trees.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."

4. The total number of humps is 304.

From the information above, we can set up the following system of equations:
\[ C + D = 180 \]
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56."
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we will break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
- Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days.
- Total distance for the first 4 days = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days:
- The total distance for the first 4 days was 800 km.
- The distance traveled in the next 2 days is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
- Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

Then, we calculate the distance traveled on the 6th day:
- Tom did not travel at all on the 6th day.
- Distance traveled on the 6th day = 0 km.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the last 6 days of the trip:
- Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for the next 6 days.
- Total distance for the last 6 days = 300 km/day * 6 days = 1800 km.

Finally, we sum up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip:
- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the 6th day + Distance for the last 6 days
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 1800 km = 2840 km.

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 2840 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, let's work backwards from the information given.

1. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cubic inches.

2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at an elevation of 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 3,000 feet."
"The second bank gave Mr. Josue twice the amount of the first bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000. 

Adding the capital from both banks to his initial capital, we get $4000 + $8000 + $5000 = $17000.

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats. Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the pricing changes.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months:
- The cost for the first 6 months was $8 per month.
- Therefore, the cost for the first 6 months is \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost for the next 2 months was $12 per month.
- Therefore, the cost for the next 2 months is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the remaining 8 months (months 9 through 16):
- The cost for the remaining 8 months was $14 per month.
- Therefore, the cost for the remaining 8 months is \(8 \times 14 = 112\) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- The total cost for 2 years is the sum of the costs for the first 6 months, the next 2 months, and the remaining 8 months.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(48 + 24 + 112 = 184\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 184."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the jeans Cole bought. The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine how much he saved from each. The total savings is $6, so 1/3 of $6 is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, which is $4, from the tattered jeans. Now, let's verify the savings. The jogger jeans cost $22, and he saved $2 from them, which is indeed 1/3 of $22. The tattered jeans cost $28, and he saved $4 from them, which is indeed 2/3 of $28.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already calculated that the jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Finally, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. 

Therefore, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 180 birds. 

\[

"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards, as he keeps \( \frac{1}{3}x \) cards. He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

Kenny uses this money to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100, and he also has $50 in spending cash. Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $150. This can be expressed as:

\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with \( x = 150 \) cards.

\[
\boxed{150}

"First, let's determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if the number of guests was 36. Half of 36 guests would be 18 guests, and each of these guests would eat two hotdogs. Therefore, 18 guests would eat 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

Since 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

The caterer prepared enough for 36 guests to have two hotdogs, which is 36 hotdogs. Since 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, the caterer was short by 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, which means her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, which totals to $25.00

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, the items are 20% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, Prince Arthur slew:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew:

\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, Prince Bruce slew:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how much money George spent on chips.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. To find out how much money he spent, we calculate 99% of $5:

\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, we can calculate the number of bags of chips he bought:

\[ \frac{4.95}{0.40} = 12.375 \]

Since George can only buy whole bags of chips, he bought 12 bags of chips. The cost for 12 bags of chips is:

\[ 12 \times 0.40 = 4.80 \]

This means George spent $4.80 on chips. The remaining amount of money he had after buying the chips is:

\[ 5.00 - 4.80 = 0.20 \]

This remaining $0.20 is the amount he spent on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can calculate the number of candy bars he bought:

\[ \frac{0.20}{0.75} = \frac{20}{75} = \frac{4}{15} \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, and \(\frac{4}{15}\) is less than 1, he did not buy any candy bars. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"

The final numerical answer is 5."
"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces. Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 2 \text{ pieces} \times \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends, which makes a total of 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

Oranges per person = 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater from his hotel.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- Therefore, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, he will arrive at the theater in \(4 + 4 = 8\) minutes after he leaves his hotel.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave her apartment 5 minutes earlier than Wayne will arrive at the theater. Since Wayne will arrive at the theater in 8 minutes, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before 8 minutes, which is 3 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 3 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width as follows:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's total from Margareth's total:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"When Marcus wakes up, the house temperature is 40 degrees.

He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees. Therefore, the temperature increase over 3 hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, after baking, the temperature in the house is:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature in the house is:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time it takes James to run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is 75 minutes.

Movie C was 75 minutes long.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A was 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:

Cost price per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
Cost price per sneaker = $576 / 48
Cost price per sneaker = $12

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale:

Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold at flash sale * Price per sneaker at flash sale
Revenue from flash sale = 17 * $20
Revenue from flash sale = $340

Now, let's calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:

Number of sneakers sold to department store = Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold at flash sale
Number of sneakers sold to department store = 48 - 17
Number of sneakers sold to department store = 31

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold to the department store:

Revenue from department store = Number of sneakers sold to department store * Price per sneaker at department store
Revenue from department store = 31 * $25
Revenue from department store = $775

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. Therefore, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and one soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

Given that you saved $2 by buying the super ticket, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the cost per balloon before the price increase, then calculate the new cost per balloon after the increase, and finally, compute the cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

1. **Determine the cost per balloon before the price increase:**

   The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   \[
   \text{Cost per balloon before increase} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**

   The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   \[
   \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Compute the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**

   \[
   \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
   \]

   To calculate \(170 \times 65\):
   \[
   170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
   \]
   \[
   170 \times 60 = 10200
   \]
   \[
   170 \times 5 = 850

   \[
   10200 + 850 = 11050
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is $11050."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

The total distance traveled is \(120 + 30 = 150\) miles.

The total time taken is \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. The value of the sapphires she traded is:

3 sapphires * $800 per sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left. The value of the 5 sapphires is:

5 sapphires * $800 per sapphire = $4000

She receives two rubies in the trade. The value of the two rubies is:

2 rubies * $1200 per ruby = $2400

The total value of all her jewels (5 sapphires and 2 rubies) is:

$4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is $6400."
"To calculate the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days."
"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob's raised beds, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \text{ cubic feet} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.
Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1920 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of green cards.
2. Determine the number of yellow cards.
3. Sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

First, let's find the number of green cards. The problem states that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. Since there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards to find the total number of cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies became 50 (initial) + 25 (added) = 75 fairies. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies. 

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies that have spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To calculate the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to determine the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes, each 1 pound, so 2 pounds.
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags, each 12 pounds, so 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
3. **Hay**: 42 bales, each 75 pounds, so 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks, each 65 pounds, so 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth two cents.
- She drinks three aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth three cents.
- She drinks five plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants.

To find 60% of Frederick's plants:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Thus, Shondra has 9 plants.

\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this, let's break down the laundry items per room:

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of laundry items per room:

- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry pieces is:

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank gains and then subtract the number of shoes he gets rid of.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gains 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes gained from Monday to Friday is 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

Now, we add the shoes gained to the initial number of shoes: 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Therefore, the number of shoes he will have on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final numerical answer is 120."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 6 inches = 12 inches

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

First, the cost of the plane tickets:
- Each plane ticket costs $5000.
- Tom and his wife each have a ticket, so the total cost for the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Next, the cost of the hotel:
- The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500.
- Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the price per day is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.
- They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Finally, the total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel:
- Total cost = $10000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15400.

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15400."

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. Therefore, the total capacity of the trays is:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray is 16."
"First, let's determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost of Razors:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Discount:**
   - The discount is ""buy one get one free.""
   - This means for every 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.

3. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost for 1 pack is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost for 2 Packs:**
   - Since she only pays for 1 pack, the total cost for 2 packs is $2.00.

5. **Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

6. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - To find the cost per razor, divide the total cost by the number of razors: \( \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \) dollars.

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 0.25 dollars is \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount and coupon is 25 cents."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. 

First, let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:

- There are 4 girls on the bottom level.
- There are 3 girls on the second level.
- There are 2 girls on the third level.
- The shortest girl is at the top, which is 60"" tall.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the girls:

\[ \text{Total height} = 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \]

The total height of the pyramid is 636 inches. To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma works for 8 hours every day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes each day.

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 8 * 5 = 40 minutes every day.

After 5 days at the office, the total minutes she has walked is 40 * 5 = 200 minutes."
"Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, which means Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old in four years. Therefore, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old. 

The final numerical answer is 38."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for morning rides is \(28 \times 6 = 168\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for afternoon rides is \(28 \times 2 = 56\).

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = $168 + $56 = $224.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $224."
"Ashley brought 5 boxes with ten oranges in each box, so Ashley brought \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges. Together, they brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of greek orange pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\). 

\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions for the total costs equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects."
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

To calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"To calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to sum the gifts for her friends and the additional gifts she bought as a surprise.

First, let's calculate the gifts for her friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts.
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts.

Adding these together, the total number of gifts for her friends is:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Next, Cherrie bought 10 more random gifts as a surprise.

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

The final numerical answer is 26."
"If the chair is 3 feet wide, then the rug, which is 5 feet wider than the chair, is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Therefore, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. 

The final numerical answer is 18."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \) dollars. Since she bought four packs of gum in total, and two of them were strawberry, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. And she bought a small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood and then determine the optimal combination of wood to maximize the number of sticks he can make with his $24.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
  - 200 sticks can be made from one 2 x 4 piece of wood.
  - Cost of one 2 x 4 piece of wood is $4.
  - Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick.

- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
  - 400 sticks can be made from one 2 x 8 piece of wood.
  - Cost of one 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6.
  - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs less per stick, Frederick should use as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible to minimize the cost per stick.

Now, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
- Cost of one 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6.
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces.

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make:
- 400 sticks per piece * 4 pieces = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his $24 is 1600."
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that Mario has 6 sled dogs and each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, the number of pairs of legs is the same as the number of legs:
\[ 24 \text{ legs} = 24 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 24 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 24 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To calculate how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to determine how much she spends on bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the amount she would save is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the question states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm).

The zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the question states the zoo has 20 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having 40 cows).

The total number of animals on the farm is 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals.
The total number of animals on the zoo is 40 cows + 20 sheep = 60 animals.

Therefore, the combined total number of animals on the farm and the zoo is 45 + 60 = 105 animals."
"Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and \( S_p \) respectively.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

\[ 4 \times S_o = 12 \]
\[ 4 \times S_p = 4 \]

To find the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we solve these equations:

\[ S_o = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ S_p = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is:

\[ S_o + S_p = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought at the market is 4."
"To reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories less than he consumes.

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 208 days (including both the start and end dates).

To find the daily calorie deficit required, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days:

\[ \text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{208 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Daily calorie deficit} = 504.808510617 \text{ calories} \]

Rounded to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of 505 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance in kilometers is:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 kilometers, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \text{ ml} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will follow the steps as described:

1. Julie initially had $500.
2. She spent 20% of it on clothes. The amount spent on clothes is 20% of $500, which is \( 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \) dollars.
3. After spending $100 on clothes, the remaining amount is \( 500 - 100 = 400 \) dollars.
4. She then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. The amount spent on CDs is 25% of $400, which is \( 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
5. After spending $100 on CDs, the remaining amount is \( 400 - 100 = 300 \) dollars.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let the cost of the lot be \( L \) and the cost of the house be \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we have:

\[ H = 3L \]

Also, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack cost $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her canvas bags is $288."
"To calculate the total number of punches Joe threw, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total duration of the fight in minutes.
2. Calculate the total number of punches thrown based on the rate of punches per minute.

Step 1: The fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 2: Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Therefore, in 15 minutes, he throws:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

The total amount of money from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount of money from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time to minutes. Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob's time in minutes is:

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour by all four is:

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold:
- In the morning, they sold 93 loaves.
- In the afternoon, they sold 39 loaves.

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

Next, we add the loaves returned by the grocery store:
- The grocery store returned 6 loaves.

Total loaves accounted for = 132 (sold) + 6 (returned) = 138 loaves.

Now, we subtract the total loaves accounted for from the total loaves baked:
- Total loaves baked = 200 loaves.

Loaves left = 200 - 138 = 62 loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 62."
"First, I will calculate the number of rows of red tulips Jackson can plant with 36 red tulips, given that he can fit 6 red tulips in a row.

Number of rows of red tulips = Total number of red tulips / Number of red tulips per row
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 6

Next, I will calculate the number of rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant with 24 blue tulips, given that he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.

Number of rows of blue tulips = Total number of blue tulips / Number of blue tulips per row
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 3

Finally, to find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, I will add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips.

Total number of rows = Number of rows of red tulips + Number of rows of blue tulips
Total number of rows = 6 + 3
Total number of rows = 9

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, I will first divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three recipes.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. If she divides these equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, each recipe will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. Therefore, the number of batches she can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix."

- Weekly cost before: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126
- Weekly cost after: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

**Step 5: Difference between the two weekly electric bills**
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which one person paints the house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is a quarter of a house. Therefore, the rate of one person is 1/4 of a house per day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\) of a house per day.

To paint a whole house, they would need to paint 1 house. Since they can paint \(\frac{5}{4}\) of a house per day, the number of days required for them to paint a whole house is the reciprocal of \(\frac{5}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{5}\) days.

To convert this into hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[
\frac{4}{5} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{4 \times 24}{5} \text{ hours} = \frac{96}{5} \text{ hours} = 19.2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house."
"To solve the problem, let's first establish the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia has. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \).

Given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]

Solving for \( C_O \):
\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Next, we need to determine the number of sofas and chairs Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \).

\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together.

Total number of sofas:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J \]
\[ \text{Total sofas} = 20 + 64 \]
\[ \text{Total sofas} = 84 \]

Total number of chairs:
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = 22 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = 88 \]

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Total sofas} + \text{Total chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 84 + 88 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 172 \]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

With $4, Tom could have bought:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ CD} \]

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom would have been able to buy is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 people get off the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:

\[ 48 - 8 = 40 \]

At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off the bus get on. Since 8 people got off, the number of people who get on the bus is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:

\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]

On the second stop, 21 people get off the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after 21 people get off is:

\[ 80 - 21 = 59 \]

At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 people got off, the number of people who get on the bus is:

\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:

\[ 59 + 7 = 66 \]

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Now, let's consider the cousin's age in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. First, we need to find Jame's age in 8 years:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

The cousin's age in 8 years will be 5 years less than this:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

Now, we need to find the cousin's current age. Since the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55 to find the cousin's current age:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Finally, to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin now, we subtract Jame's current age from the cousin's current age:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of years separating the age of the two now is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( C = 1100 \)
3. \( P = C - 400 \)

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the third equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substituting the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

\(\boxed{300}\)"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are ten boys and ten girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are ten girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ 84 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"To find the total thickness of the four books, I will calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, I will add the thicknesses of the four books:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

The total number of vlogs she has made so far is:
18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:
72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs already made) = 18 vlogs.

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal."
"To solve this, first calculate the tip on the $50 dinner bill. The tip is 20% of $50, which is:

\[ 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount to be paid, including the tip, is:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, I ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the initial share of each boy. The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy's initial share is:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

The eldest boy's initial share is $6. He then adds $5 to his share, making it:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

The following day, he adds another $10 to his share, making it:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

He then spends $8 from his total, so his share becomes:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. Let's denote the amount he had left after spending the $8 as \( x \). So, \( x = 13 \). Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 3 \times 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[ 39 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves in the second half of April, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half, and that his total monthly savings target is $1125.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings in the first and second halves of April:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's total monthly savings target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he saves:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, I will calculate the total cost of the apples, then the total cost of the oranges, and finally the total cost of the peaches. After that, I will sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits. Finally, I will subtract this total cost from $20 to find the change Verna received.

Cost of apples: 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
Cost of oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
Cost of peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Total cost of fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Change received: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $7.00."

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. If she finishes 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the difference between Jairus's earnings and Jenny's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of toys needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.

James's play set has 80 toys. Therefore, a play set five times larger would have:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. This means that Jonathan needs 400 toys in total. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, I will first calculate the cost of each item he wants to buy, then sum them up, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 each = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25 each = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00 = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00 = $10.00

Now, I will sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

Next, I will apply the 10% discount:
Discount amount = 10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

Finally, I will subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Final amount = $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water.

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. 

Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

In cold water, the time to swim 3 miles is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

In warm water, the time to swim 3 miles is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:

\(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"To calculate how many weeks it will take John to save $80, I will first determine his weekly earnings.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia and Juan.

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \). Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee per day.

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee per day.

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

4. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended daily intake from Juan's current intake:
   \[
   5R - 4
   \]

5. Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, we need to express the reduction in terms of \( R \). However, the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), but it is not necessary to know the exact value of \( R \) to find the reduction in terms of \( R \).

Therefore, the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake is:

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of the three friends:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

Adding the weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

Dividing by 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours.

The angle of the sun from the ground when it starts at the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house every hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle of the sun from the ground after 10 hours will be the sum of the initial angle from the ground and the angle the sun has moved upward:

"To solve this, first, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means he is 8 years old.

So, the total number of candles needed is 12 (for the older son) + 8 (for the younger son) = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night, she read for 7 nights. Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read each night. Since she read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read per minute:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages Judy read in the first week:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Adding the pages read in the second week:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 240 \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

"To solve this, let's denote Shiloh's age in 7 years as \( S_{7} \) and his nephew's age in 7 years as \( N_{7} \).

Given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years he will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old. So, \( S_{7} = 51 \).

It is also given that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S_{7} = 3 \times N_{7} \]

Substituting the value of \( S_{7} \):
\[ 51 = 3 \times N_{7} \]

To find \( N_{7} \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ N_{7} = \frac{51}{3} = 17 \]

So, in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be 17 years old. To find his current age, we subtract 7 from 17:
\[ N = 17 - 7 = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the first three teeth: $1.00.
   - Half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   - Total for the last two teeth: \( 0.50 \times 2 = 1 \) dollar.

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Therefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we first need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

From the information that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored:
\[ \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

From the information that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored:
\[ \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding their individual goals:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonade than Liam, we first need to calculate the amount of money Mitchell made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, and then how much he spends on plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday. Finally, I will determine the total number of action figures he can buy.

Peter has $70 to spend. He spends $5 on wooden action figures each day from Sunday to Wednesday, which is 4 days. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $20 on wooden action figures, Peter has:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has 4 days left (Thursday through Sunday), so the total amount he can spend on plastic action figures is:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:
\[ 20 \text{ (wooden)} + 4 \text{ (plastic)} = 24 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 24 \]"

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of repairing the 4 broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Adding these together, the total cost is $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

Therefore, the total cost for Leah is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, I will first calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week, and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

The total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 100."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total amount removed from the account over the 2 years, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Katina starts with $3000. She removes $100 every month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 24 months.

Total amount removed in 2 years = $100/month * 24 months = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
Remaining amount = $3000 - $2400 = $600

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $600."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bread and cheese/condiments:

- Cost of bread: $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. To make 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
- Cost of cheese/condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of cheese/condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese/condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."

"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the cost of padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: The first operation is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The result of the first operation is then divided by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: The result of the second operation is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12:

"To solve this problem, I will first determine the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. Then, I will apply this same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

The oven is off by 14 degrees when set to 450 degrees. The percentage off is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual temperature} - \text{Set temperature}}{\text{Set temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage off} = 0.04 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage off} = 4\% \]

Now, we apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe:

\[ \text{Adjusted temperature} = \text{Set temperature} - \left( \text{Set temperature} \times \text{Percentage off} \right) \]

\[ \text{Adjusted temperature} = 520 - \left( 520 \times 0.04 \right) \]

\[ \text{Adjusted temperature} = 520 - 20.8 \]

\[ \text{Adjusted temperature} = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 499.2 degrees to compensate for the 4% off temperature."

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes, it is 2 * 60 + 5 = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long.

Adding the durations of the two movies together, we get 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's price.

Herb's house price is $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's price gives us the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $100.00:
\[ 10\% \times 100 = 0.10 \times 100 = 10 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

So, one box of contacts costs $90.00 after the discount.

Now, Pete is buying 2 boxes of contacts. The total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{180} = 1 \]

So, each pair of contacts costs $1.00. 

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

- For every 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- To find out how many 200 calorie units are in 1600 calories, we divide 1600 by 200.
- 1600 calories / 200 calories/unit = 8 units.

Since each unit of 200 calories requires 100 ml of water, for 8 units, she needs:
- 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml of water.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans is:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can determine the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ 90 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, I will calculate the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, I will add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, I will divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Adding these together, the total number of legs is \(20 + 8 + 20 = 48\).

\[
\text{Total number of legs} = 48

"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Determine the new weight after increasing the original weight by 50%.
2. Subtract 2 pounds from the new weight to find the final weight.

Step 1: Increase the original weight by 50%.
The original weight is 8 pounds. To find 50% of 8 pounds, I calculate:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]
So, the new weight after a 50% increase is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Subtract 2 pounds from the new weight.
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We can calculate the time required by dividing the additional distance by the speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the plane would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make in 12 hours. Since Ruiz works at a rate of 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours he makes:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Similarly, since Marissa works at a rate of 45 pounds per hour, in 12 hours she makes:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the totals together, the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ \text{Total chocolate} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1260 \]"
"On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is $8 * 2 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is $16 * 4 = $64.

The total amount spent over the three days is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If Howard originally had $100, then the amount of money he has left after these expenditures is $100 - $88 = $12."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, I will first calculate the earnings for each period and then sum them up.

For the first four hours:
Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
Earnings for the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30.00

For the next two hours:
Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Earnings for the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.00

Total earnings = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours
Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo in a month and then determine how many months the tires can last before needing replacement.

First, we calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month:
- The car drives 400 miles a month.
- For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
- Therefore, for 400 miles, the tires rotate \( \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \) times.

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before needing replacement. We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. We divide the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations they make in a month:
- \( \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \) months.

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
- Since there are 12 months in a year, \( 72 \) months is \( \frac{72}{12} = 6 \) years.

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years."
"To find the cost of each pump in cents, we first need to determine the total number of washes that can be achieved with one bottle of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washes. Therefore, 1 pump of shampoo will give 120 / 2 = 60 washes.

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump in dollars, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps in the bottle:

\[ \text{Cost per pump in dollars} = \frac{24.00}{2} = 12.00 \]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12.00 \times 100 = 1200 \]

Thus, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the sale price of the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required for that number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. A week has 7 days.

First, calculate the total number of dozens of croissants:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how much butter is needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving both streets and then find the difference.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it took 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 - 5) each month cost 50% more than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The increased funding per month for the extended period is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total funding for the extended 45 months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the initial 5 months funding and the extended 45 months funding.
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, I will calculate the meat consumed by each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total meat consumed by the second player is 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, I will sum the meat consumed by the first three players:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the number of days in March and the average number of posts per day per member.

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jim starts with a 20 pack of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school hours (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
4. He chews 1 piece after dinner.
5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed.

Let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews during the day:

- Chews 4 pieces during school hours.
- Chews 1 piece on the way home.
- Chews 1 piece after dinner.
- Total chewed during the day: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has left after chewing 6 pieces:

- Initial pack: 20 pieces.
- After chewing 6 pieces: 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Next, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

- Half of 14 pieces: 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
- Remaining after giving half to his sister: 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."

"To calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, let's convert the speed from kb to Mb:
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second.
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide 20 kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per second:
  \[
  \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second}
  \]

Next, we convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour:
- There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
- To find the speed in Mb per hour, we multiply the speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
  \[
  0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds per hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour}

"To solve this problem, I will break it down into parts and calculate the total number of cars towed over the week.

First, let's calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days:
- On the first day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- On the second day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- On the third day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.

The total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week. There are four days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), and on each of these days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars on the first three days, on each of the remaining days it pulled:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ cars} \]

The total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 + 24 = 54 \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Adam is 40 inches tall, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, we have:

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars:

30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the total sales minus the cost the company paid to acquire the cars:

$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, we calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, we calculate the number of women as follows:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price of the gold jewel.
2. Determine the price of the silver jewel.
3. Sum the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, the price of the silver jewel is:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by summing the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}
\]"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, I will calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Snowflake stamps: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. Truck stamps: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.
3. Rose stamps: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, I will sum up the stamps:
- Snowflake stamps: 16
- Truck stamps: 19
- Rose stamps: 10

Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means that every hour, Tom closes 15 miles on Bob. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is closing the gap:

\[ \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"If Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, then Darren caught:

17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, Tommy caught:

11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 classes:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per class if the total cost is more than $10 per class. We set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} > \$10 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ \$6 > \$10 \]

This inequality is false, which means the total cost of $60 is not more than $10 per class. Therefore, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the given condition.

Since the total cost of $60 is not more than $10 per class, Manny can miss all 10 classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to establish how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the weekly customers processed by both Julie and Jewel to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Jewel's weekly customers} + \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

"To solve this problem, I will first determine the cost of one apple and one orange, and then calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

First, let's find the cost of one apple:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Therefore, one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange:
- Three oranges cost $3.30.
- Therefore, one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- The cost for 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
- The cost for 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price to the cost of the additional features.

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the raise and bonus, I will first calculate his monthly salary after the raise and bonus, and then multiply that by 12 to get the annual salary.

His monthly salary before the raise and bonus is $20000.

The raise is 5% of $20000, which is:
\[ 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:
\[ 0.5 \times 20000 = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
\[ 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find his annual salary, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
\[ 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year."
"To calculate the total cost, I will first determine the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. Cost of suits:
   James buys 10 suits at $750 each.
   Cost of suits = 10 * $750 = $7500

2. Cost of dress pants:
   The cost of a dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   Cost of a dress pant = 1/5 * $750 = $150
   James buys 10 dress pants at $150 each.
   Cost of dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500

3. Cost of dress shirts:
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits.
   Total number of dress shirts = 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts
   Cost of each dress shirt is $60.
   Cost of dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1800

Now, I will sum up the costs of all items:
Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

Therefore, the total cost is $10800."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the average daily publications and the number of days in February.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Therefore, in February, which has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Therefore, in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Adding the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we get:

"To calculate the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, we sum the times to get the total time:
Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the final price Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday, and then calculate the final price Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday. Finally, I will find the difference between the two final prices.

On Tuesday:
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- She got a $2 discount.
- The total cost before discount is 20 * $20 = $400.
- After the $2 discount, the total cost is $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday:
- The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
- The total cost before discount is 20 * $30 = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = $60.
- The final cost after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

The final numerical answer is $142."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the sales from green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from red hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find the total sales in the second month. According to the problem, the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total sales in the first month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, to find the total sales over the two months, we add the sales from the first month and the sales from the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales over two months} = \text{Total sales in the first month} + \text{Sales in the second month} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is:

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The second hour costs twice that, which is $30. The third hour also costs twice the first hour, which is $60.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

1. Sally's bank account at the start of the week: $200
2. Sally's bank account at the end of the week: $420
3. Sally's weekly wage should be: $300

First, we calculate the total amount Sally should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage:
\[ \text{Total amount Sally should have} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Weekly wage} = 200 + 300 = 500 \]

Next, we find the difference between the amount Sally actually has in her bank account and the amount she should have:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Actual amount in bank account} - \text{Total amount Sally should have} = 420 - 500 = -80 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Sally has received $80 less than her full weekly wage. Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 80 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \times 2 \text{ whole eggs per deviled egg half} = 96 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs this is. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, I will break it down into the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for renting a hanger and fuel, then sum them up.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Costs:**
   - James pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger.
   - He spends twice as much on fuel, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 a month.

3. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of renting a hanger + Cost of fuel
   - Total monthly cost = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

4. **Annual Cost:**
   - Annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12 months
   - Annual cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - Total cost = Initial cost of the plane + Annual cost
   - Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the cooking times for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Rice Cooking Time:**
   - Given: 30 minutes.

2. **Pork Cooking Time:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Therefore, pork cooking time = rice cooking time + 20 minutes.
   - Pork cooking time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Beans Cooking Time:**
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, beans cooking time = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total time = rice cooking time + pork cooking time + beans cooking time.
   - Total time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, and then the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Finally, I will find the difference between these two costs.

1. Cost of 1/2 pound almonds:
   1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5

2. Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
   1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5

3. Total cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds + 1/3 pound walnuts):

"To solve this problem, I will use the information given and set up a system of equations.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads is 20.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( S \) and \( G \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The numbers match the given conditions, so the solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate 20% of $5: \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \)
2. Add this to the original price: \( 5 + 1 = 6 \)

So, the more expensive coffee costs $6 per pound.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and there are 7 days in a week.

1. Total coffee cost for a week: \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \)

Now, let's add the cost of the donut. The donut costs $2.

1. Total cost of the donut: \( 2 \)

Finally, let's add the total cost of the coffee and the donut:

1. Total cost: \( 42 + 2 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total cost for Roger's coffee and donut is $44."
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 in total.

He bought:
- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each, which totals $2.00 x 2 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the items he bought:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209 = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the number of recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours John attends.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total class hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks. Therefore, the total number of class hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, the number of recipes he learns is:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \text{Total time sleeping} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the amount of money each person has, and then calculate how much each would have if they shared equally.

Given:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to analyze the given information and calculate accordingly.

Christina's mood over the past thirty days is as follows:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

This leaves the last eight days of the month to be analyzed.

We know:
- Total days: 30
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

The first eight days were all good, so the number of good days left is:
12 - 8 = 4

The second eight days were all bad, so there are no good days left from this period.

The third eight days were neutral, so there are no good days left from this period.

The next three days were: Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the number of good days left in the month is:
4 (from the first eight days) + 1 (from the next three days) = 5

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 5."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ J = 21 \]

Substituting the value of \( J \) into the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"First, I will convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches, as the growth rate is given in inches per day.

1 foot = 12 inches

Therefore, 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To reach a height of 600 inches, the bamboo needs to grow an additional 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Now, to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days.

Therefore, the bamboo will be 600 inches tall in 12 days."
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.
   - Therefore, James needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James buys 8 toys.
   - Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys.
   - There are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in the shelter.

3. **Second Purchase:**
   - James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs means 12 * 2 = 24 more dogs.
   - Therefore, there are 12 (original dogs) + 24 (new dogs) = 36 dogs in the shelter now.
   - James needs 36 toys to have one toy per dog.
   - He already has 12 toys.
   - Therefore, he needs to buy 36 - 12 = 24 more toys.

4. **Third Purchase:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - Therefore, there are 36 - 3 = 33 dogs in the shelter now.
   - James no longer needs toys for these 3 dogs.
   - He still needs toys for the remaining 33 dogs.
   - He already has 12 + 24 = 36 toys.
   - Therefore, he needs to buy 36 - 33 = 3 more toys.

5. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - First purchase: 8 toys
   - Second purchase: 24 toys
   - Third purchase: 3 toys
   - Total: 8 + 24 + 3 = 35 toys

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 35."

"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We want to find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes.

So, we have the proportion:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} \]

\[ x = \frac{3456}{6} \]

\[ x = 576 \]

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add the number of cookies each person has:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can set up the following equation to represent the final length of the dress:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 centimeters."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half of his lawn in each mode, and then sum these times to find the total time.

In ""turtle"" mode, Chris takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since he is mowing half of the lawn, it will take him half of 1 hour, which is 30 minutes.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn. Again, since he is mowing half of the lawn, it will take him half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, I will add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn:

30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write the equation:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 13."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month, then find the total number of coins each has saved after ten years, and finally add these totals together.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong per month. To find out how many coins Neil saves per month, we calculate:

\[ \text{Neil's coins per month} = 20 + \left(20 \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved after ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings after ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings after ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding their total savings together:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:

"To calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to consider the fireworks she will see in the city display and the fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city display:
- Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks.
- They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Therefore, the total number of fireworks in the city display is \(15 \times 20 = 300\) fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Therefore, the total number of fireworks in her backyard display is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) fireworks.

Now, we need to consider that Hannah will see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks she will see, we calculate 40% of 300:
- 40% of 300 is \(0.40 \times 300 = 120\) fireworks.

Finally, we add the number of fireworks Hannah will see in the city display to the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard:
- Total fireworks Hannah will see is \(120 + 15 = 135\).

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. Therefore, the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person will have a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks for one person:

\[ \text{Cost for one person} = 2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2/\text{drink} + 3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2/\text{snack} = 4 + 6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for drinks and snacks for the entire group is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10/\text{person} = \$200 \]

Therefore, the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:

\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

"First, let's determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. 

\[

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the amount raised per hour and then determine the total number of hours needed to reach the goal.

The total amount raised after 3 hours is $2100. Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\$2100}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$700 \text{ per hour} \]

The goal is to raise $6300. The amount still needed to reach the goal is:

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = \$6300 - \$2100 = \$4200 \]

To find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\$4200}{\$700 \text{ per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours needed to reach the goal is the sum of the hours already raised and the additional hours needed:

\[ \text{Total hours needed} = 3 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by Colorado City is:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:

\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

Thus, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

\[ 68\% \]

Let me now present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ 68\% \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To solve this, let's first understand the deal: for every 2 scoops of ice cream bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops of ice cream, she only pays for 2.

Given that each scoop costs $1.50, let's calculate how many scoops she can get for $6.00.

First, let's find out how many scoops she can buy with $6.00:
\[ \text{Number of scoops she can buy} = \frac{\$6.00}{\$1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how many free scoops she gets with 4 scoops bought:
\[ \text{Free scoops} = \frac{4 \text{ scoops bought}}{3} = 1 \text{ free scoop} \]

So, with $6.00, she can get 4 scoops bought and 1 free scoop, which totals to:
\[ 4 \text{ scoops bought} + 1 \text{ free scoop} = 5 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them consumes over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total bathroom area.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's calculate:

1. The area to be covered is two thirds of 36 sq ft:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

2. Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, the total number of tiles needed is:
\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. 

The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price per pound at the store is $2.5, and he picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid for picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

2. **Total number of pizzas**: 5 friends * 1 pizza each = 5 pizzas.
3. **Total number of pizza slices**: 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices.

Now, let's calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends:

4. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**:
   - Each of the 3 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices, so 2/3 of a pizza is 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.
   - Therefore, each of the 3 friends ate 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the 3 friends = 3 friends * 8 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Next, let's calculate how many slices were eaten by the remaining two friends:

5. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends**:
   - Each of the remaining 2 friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices, so 3/4 of a pizza is 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices.
   - Therefore, each of the 2 friends ate 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the 2 friends = 2 friends * 9 slices per friend = 18 slices.

Now, let's sum up the total number of slices eaten:

6. **Total slices eaten**:
   - Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends: 24 slices.
   - Slices eaten by the remaining two friends: 18 slices.

"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. 

To find the time it takes the dog, we calculate:
\[
\text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of animals (which is 2 in this case):
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 

Adding the 4 inches to the 96 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches. 

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. 

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. 

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. 

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \times 1 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:

The total number of spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

The number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her spools that are blue is 40%."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.

First, calculate the number of people who had voted by midday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday was:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 was:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, I will first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days, and then determine how many packs are required.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

A pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Thus, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. We know that each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- To make 24 smores, we need \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves of graham crackers.

Since each box contains 3 sleeves of graham crackers, they will need 1 box to have 3 sleeves.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 1."
"To solve the problem, let's first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother based on the information provided.

1. **Dora's age**: 15 years old.
2. **Dora's father's age**: Eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - Twice Dora's age: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \)
   - Eight more than twice Dora's age: \( 30 + 8 = 38 \)
   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.

3. **Dora's mother's age**: Four years younger than Dora's father.
   - Dora's father is 38 years old.
   - Four years younger than Dora's father: \( 38 - 4 = 34 \)
   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
- Dora's age: 15 years
- Dora's father's age: 38 years
- Dora's mother's age: 34 years

Total combined age:
\[ 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"To find the total weight of all of Cindy's books, I will first calculate the weight of each book and then sum them up.

1. Math and Science books: Each weighs 2 pounds, and there are two of them.
   - Weight of Math book: 2 pounds
   - Weight of Science book: 2 pounds
   - Total weight of Math and Science books: 2 + 2 = 4 pounds

2. French book: Weighs 4 pounds.

3. English book: Weighs 3 pounds.

4. History book: Weighs twice as much as her English book.
   - Weight of English book: 3 pounds
   - Weight of History book: 2 * 3 = 6 pounds

Now, I will sum up the weights of all the books:
- Total weight of Math and Science books: 4 pounds
- Weight of French book: 4 pounds
- Weight of English book: 3 pounds
- Weight of History book: 6 pounds

Total weight = 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 0.50 \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"Boris originally has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total amount of water used for the giant, medium, and small cubes, and then subtract this from the total amount of water Peter has.

Peter has 32 ounces of water.

For the giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

For the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

For the small cubes:
8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, I will add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Finally, I will subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water Peter has:
32 ounces (initial amount) - 30 ounces (used) = 2 ounces

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is 2 ounces."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, Steven has half the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of students who like to play music. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the total number of students in the class is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10. The rest of the students like to play video games or play music. We have already calculated that 10 students like to play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 50 - 10 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 30 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away 1/3 of that number. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mara initially had 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. She added 3 more slices to the plate, so the total number of slices became 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she had. So, 5 slices * 3 = 15 slices.
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend then stole 5 slices, so the number of slices left is 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals.

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day.

Thus, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the packs of old magic cards that Mark bought. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[ 1100 \]"
"To calculate the savings, we first need to determine the total cost for Jake's family at each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $26 = $52.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $12 = $24.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $14 = $28.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $10 = $20.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the total costs at the two parks:
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28.

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the cost per day before the switch:**
   - He used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $0.5 each.
   - Cost per day = 500 tomatoes * $0.5/tomato = $250.

2. **Calculate the cost per day after the switch:**
   - He now buys 500 tomatoes a day at $0.4 each.
   - Cost per day = 500 tomatoes * $0.4/tomato = $200.

3. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   - Daily savings = Cost per day before - Cost per day after
   - Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

4. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7 days
   - Weekly savings = $50 * 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, Cal has \( 56 \times 2 = 112 \) marbles.
3. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Carl has \( 56 \times 4 = 224 \) marbles.

Now, to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Thus, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 336."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. We need to divide these students into 12 groups of equal size. To find the number of students per group, we perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, it is clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups of equal size. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, implying we need to find the minimum number of groups that can accommodate all 54 students with each group having an equal number of students.

To find the minimum number of groups, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can divide 54 students into groups of whole numbers. The smallest number of groups that can do this is 54 itself, which would mean each group has 1 student. However, since the question specifies 12 groups, we need to find the next possible number of groups that can divide 54 students into equal groups.

The factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. The factors that are greater than 12 are 18, 27, and 54. The smallest factor greater than 12 is 18. Therefore, the minimum number of groups needed to divide 54 students into equal groups is 18, with each group having 3 students.

Since the activity is currently divided into 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 18 groups:

\[ 18 - 12 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental numbers for weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
- Therefore, in one week, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekend:
- There are 2 days in a weekend.
- Candy rents 100 chairs each day of the weekend.
- Therefore, in one weekend, the number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- In one month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(4 \times 300 = 1200\) chairs.
- In one month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(4 \times 200 = 800\) chairs.
- Therefore, in one month, the total number of chairs rented is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- In two months, the total number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs.

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:

\[ 24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas} \]

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas:

\[ 49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas} \]

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:

\[ 37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1200 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Since there are 4 roommates, each will pay:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ dollars/year}}{4 \text{ roommates}} = 300 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates sent to the party:

- 8 dozen glasses: 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates: 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates that were returned:

- 10 glasses were broken, so 96 - 10 = 86 glasses were returned.
- 6 plates were broken, so 48 - 6 = 42 plates were returned.

Now, let's add the returned items to the original count:

- Total glasses now: 96 + 86 = 182 glasses
- Total plates now: 48 + 42 = 90 plates

So, Jeff now has 182 glasses and 90 plates. The final numerical answer is:

182 glasses and 90 plates."
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so 27 small buttons are worth 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - 10% of 30 small stickers = 0.1 * 30 = 3 small stickers remain.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers remain.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Total buttons = 9 (large) + 20 (large) + 60 (small) = 89 buttons.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 89."

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

Given that there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes cast is 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the big race. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 people is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \text{ are Pomeranians} \]

We are also informed that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}P = 6 \]
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 3 \times 9 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so the third house will need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[
x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house, needing double the first house, will need:

\[
2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100
\]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles."
"To calculate the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, I will calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then sum them up.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each:
3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each:
5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each:
1 head of lettuce * $3/head = $3

Now, I will sum up the amounts:
$6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14

Therefore, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck is $14."
"If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, then the number of pears can be calculated as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of Number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is the sum of the bananas and the pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

The final numerical answer is 490."
"First, I will calculate the amount of money Marissa has left after buying the ball.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball.

So, the remaining money is:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, I will determine how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

To find the number of candy bars, I will divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 times the amount of oranges required for 1 liter. Therefore, Sam would need 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges. Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, Sam would have to spend 20 * $3 = $60 to make 4 liters of juice. 

The final numerical answer is $60."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed must have read half of that amount:

Ahmed's books = Ezra's books / 2
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know that Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. If Ezra decided to read 150 more books, the total number of books Ezra read would be:

Ezra's total books = Ezra's books + 150
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

Now, to find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add the total books read by each:

Total books read = Ahmed's books + Ezra's total books
Total books read = 150 + 450
Total books read = 600

Therefore, the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 600."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales of each type of scent and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents by the end of the day.

The difference in sales is calculated as follows:
5 (vanilla scents sold) - 2 (fruity scents sold) = 3

Therefore, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet has earned from selling the eggplants.

He sold 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the total earnings from the eggplants are:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to earn from the corn, we subtract the earnings from the eggplants from the total desired earnings:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs to earn by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total time Tatiana has available over the weekend, then determine how much time she spends on video games and reading, and finally calculate the time she spends on soccer. After that, I will find the percentage of her weekend spent on soccer.

First, let's calculate the total time available over the weekend:
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
Total time = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, we know that Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time after reading is:
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time spent on soccer:
Time spent on soccer = Remaining time after reading - Time spent on video games
Time spent on soccer = 9 - 3 = 6 hours

Finally, to find the percentage of her weekend spent on soccer, we use the formula:
Percentage of weekend spent on soccer = (Time spent on soccer / Total time) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent on soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is 50%."
"To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, I will follow the steps of the problem:

1. Anthony initially had 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. Therefore, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   So, the number of pencils Anthony has left after giving to Brandon is:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25
   \]
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. Therefore, the number of pencils given to Charlie is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]
   So, the number of pencils Anthony has left after giving to Charlie is:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10
   \]

Thus, Anthony kept 10 pencils. The final numerical answer is:

10"
"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \text{ hours} \]"
"To determine how many wheels Henry will have left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, I will first calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles, and then subtract this from the total number of wheels he has.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles together gives the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels he has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find the amount of the discount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \frac{\text{Discount percentage}}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 \]

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 200 \]

Now subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

\[ \text{Final price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} \]

\[ \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 \]

\[ \text{Final price} = 800 \]

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \]

This means there are 200 movies in series. Therefore, the number of movies that are not in series is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

This means there are 160 older movies. Therefore, the number of movies that are not older movies is:

\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the non-series movies that are not older is $10 each. The cost of the older movies is $5 each.

The total cost for the series movies is:

\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

The total cost for the non-series movies that are not older is:

\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

The total cost for the older movies is:

\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

\[ 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4400 \]"

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the distance they drove and then the distance they hiked, and finally sum these distances to find the total distance to their vacation spot.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
   - Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies. Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects \( B - 3 \) berries. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has 4 seconds less than the maximum time.

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Ava's score: \( 10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B - 3) + 30 \times (t - 4) \)
- Emma's score: \( 10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times t \)

Where \( t \) is the time left on the timer when they finish the level.

Let's simplify the expressions for their scores:
- Ava's score: \( 10E + 80 + 5B - 15 + 30t - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30t - 55 \)
- Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30t \)

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30t - 55) - (10E + 5B + 30t) = -55 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is -55 points. This means Emma scores 55 points more than Ava."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is 30 + 30 = 60 dollars.

Subtracting the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost gives us the cost of the other two pizzas:
64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, each of these pizzas costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on a regular day. They ride their bikes thrice a day, so:
\[ 3 \text{ times/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many times they ride their bikes on the two days when they ride twice as much as usual. On these days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ times/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes over the 5 days. For the 3 days when they ride 3 times each day, the total is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 9 \text{ times} \]

For the 2 days when they ride 6 times each day, the total is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ times/day} = 12 \text{ times} \]

Adding these two totals together gives the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week:
\[ 9 \text{ times} + 12 \text{ times} = 21 \text{ times} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding the fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we first need to determine the total distance Andy travels in a week and then calculate the amount of fuel he consumes.

Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 10 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance Andy travels in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Given that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the amount of fuel he consumes in a week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the cost of the fuel Andy consumes in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times $3/\text{gallon} = $15/\text{week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent in quarters and twenties.

Carrie has 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. She was given ten twenties, so the total amount of money from the twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts spent on quarters and twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then add them together.

From the tomato plants:
Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
So, the total yield from tomato plants is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \) tomatoes.

From the eggplant plants:
Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
So, the total yield from eggplant plants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) eggplants.

Adding the total yield from both types of plants:
\( 110 \) tomatoes + \( 32 \) eggplants = \( 142 \) fruits.

Therefore, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales are 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has agreed to cover half of this cost, which is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the school will cover $150 of the trip's cost. This means John still needs to cover the remaining half of the trip's cost, which is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he still needs:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing $100."
"First, let's determine the temperature inside the house during the night. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. Therefore, the temperature at night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since the temperature during the night is 12 degrees, which is below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The difference between the current temperature and the temperature needed to prevent freezing is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."

"To calculate the total money Damien makes in a 30-day month, I will first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply by the number of days in the month.

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day. Therefore, his daily earnings are:

\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in the month:

\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

So, the total money Damien makes in a 30-day month is $75.00."
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour for regular hours.

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours she worked, which is 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours.

Her special hourly rate for overtime is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate 150% of $20.

\[ \text{Overtime hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her pay for the additional 3 hours of work.

\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total pay for the day.

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on last Tuesday."

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.
3. Multiply the total salary paid in one month by the number of months (three months).

First, let's calculate the number of employees after three months:
- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Number of new employees hired in three months: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

Total number of employees after three months: \( 200 + 60 = 260 \)

Next, we calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month:
- Salary per employee per month: $4000
- Total number of employees: 260

Total salary paid in one month: \( 260 \times 4000 = 1040000 \)

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months:
- Total salary paid in one month: $1,040,000
- Number of months: 3

Total amount of money paid after three months: \( 1040000 \times 3 = 3120000 \)

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"To find the total time they will be caroling, I will add the duration of ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the duration of ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so twice it will be:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Adding these together:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

Therefore, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate Billy's total earnings over the period of time mentioned, and then calculate Sally's starting salary and her total earnings. Finally, I will find the difference between their total earnings.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise to $10.50 per hour, and on his first anniversary, he received another raise to $11.00 per hour. Assuming he worked 20 hours per month, we can calculate his total earnings over the period of time mentioned.

Billy's earnings over the period:
- For the first 2 months, he worked at $10 per hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month * $10/hour = $400
- For the next 2 months, he worked at $10.50 per hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month * $10.50/hour = $420
- For the next 2 months, he worked at $11.00 per hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month * $11.00/hour = $440

Total earnings for Billy = $400 + $420 + $440 = $1260

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10 per hour. Therefore, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour. Assuming Sally also works 20 hours per month, her total earnings over the same period of time would be:

Sally's earnings over the period:
- For the first 2 months, she worked at $10.50 per hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month * $10.50/hour = $420
- For the next 2 months, she worked at $10.50 per hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month * $10.50/hour = $420
- For the next 2 months, she worked at $10.50 per hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month * $10.50/hour = $420

Total earnings for Sally = $420 + $420 + $420 = $1260

Now, we can find the difference between Billy's and Sally's total earnings:

Difference = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $1260 - $1260 = $0

Therefore, Billy will earn $0 more than Sally over the period of time mentioned."
"To solve this, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and the cost of 2 bagels, then find the difference.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is:
3 loaves * $2/loaf = $6

The cost of 2 bagels is:
2 bagels * $1/bagel = $2

Now, to find how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:
$6 - $2 = $4

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to calculate Nikita's score based on the information given.

Pierson's score is 278 points.

Nikita's score is 11 more than half of Pierson's score. So, we first calculate half of Pierson's score:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Then, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers at Ashley's school.

First, let's determine the total number of students and teachers at the school:

- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Each class has an average of 3 teachers.

The total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

The total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, and then determine how many stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of all her stuffed animals.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30(14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the hours Kris has already played.

First, calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
- Therefore, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, calculate the hours played in the following week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total hours played in the following week is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the following week:
- Total hours played = 7 hours (first 2 weeks) + 14 hours (following week) = 21 hours.

Finally, to find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal:
- Hours needed = 30 hours (goal) - 21 hours (played) = 9 hours.

Therefore, the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement is 9 hours."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, I will calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
\[ 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

The difference in the distance traveled by the two cars after 2 hours is:
\[ 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added:

Cost of diamond = $600
Cost of gold = $300

Total cost before premium = $600 + $300 = $900

Now, let's calculate the premium:

Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, let's calculate the total cost including the premium:

Total cost = Total cost before premium + Premium
Total cost = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on its height and the area.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has. He has two bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we use the area formula for a rectangle (length times height):
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is 4 inches."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon equals 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short of 50 candies at this point. He then ordered 100 more candies. Therefore, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy. 

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference from the initial number of students.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

At the end of the first month, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.

At the end of the second month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

At the end of the third month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

At the end of the fourth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

At the end of the fifth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

At the end of the sixth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 320 * 2 = 640 students.

At the end of the seventh month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 640 * 2 = 1280 students.

At the end of the eighth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 1280 * 2 = 2560 students.

At the end of the ninth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 2560 * 2 = 5120 students.

At the end of the tenth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 5120 * 2 = 10240 students.

At the end of the eleventh month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 10240 * 2 = 20480 students.

At the end of the twelfth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20480 * 2 = 40960 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students who have joined by the end of May (which is the end of the fourth month), we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of the fourth month:

320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix made $105 and he charges $.25 for each branch he climbs, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day} \]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and then subtract the petals of the flowers she lost.

First, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picked:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she loses:
\[ 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtract the petals she lost from the total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they have used 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Jack and his friends play. They play for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. Therefore, the number of quarters Jack uses is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Jack's two friends who are significantly worse than him can play for half as long as Jack, which is 10 minutes per quarter. The total time they play is:
\[ 2 \times 10 \text{ minutes/quarter} = 20 \text{ minutes/quarter} \]
So, the number of quarters they use is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

The friend who is significantly better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes per quarter. The total time he plays is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes/quarter} \]
So, the number of quarters he uses is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \]

Now, we sum the quarters used by Jack, his two friends who are significantly worse, and the friend who is significantly better:
\[ 12 + 12 + 8 = 32 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces."
"John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so the cost for the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500. He also bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so the cost for the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000. Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cars Joe has initially.
2. Calculate how many cars Joe sells.
3. Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother.
4. Subtract the number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars Joe has.

Step 1: Determine how many cars Joe has initially.
Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Step 2: Calculate how many cars Joe sells.
Joe sells 20% of his cars:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Step 3: Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother.
Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Step 4: Subtract the number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars Joe has.
Joe's remaining cars after selling and giving some to his mother:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the students is the total amount raised by the charity minus the amount raised by organizations. 

The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total time Sandy walked in hours, and then convert that time into minutes.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.

On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy walked in two days is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes."
"During the lunch break, half the number of cars that were in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class had gone. Initially, there were 50 cars in the morning and 20 more cars arrived during the first break, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70 cars. When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of these 70 cars had gone, which means 70 / 2 = 35 cars had left the parking lot. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars."
"To calculate John's earnings for a full 7 day week, I will first determine his daily earnings and then multiply by 7.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20. Therefore, the earnings from one cycle are:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Now, to find out how much he earns in a day, we multiply the earnings from one cycle by the number of cycles he does in a day:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Finally, to find out how much he earns in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
\[ \$180.00/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260.00/\text{week} \]

Therefore, John makes \$1260.00 if he works a full 7 day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game to the points from the second game: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:

\[
5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
\]

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00 \]

The loss Milly will incur is the total shipping cost minus the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:
\[ \$3.00 - \$24.00 = -\$21.00 \]

Since the loss cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:
\[ \$21.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gives her an additional $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140. She then spends $30 on the first pair of jeans, $30 on the second pair of jeans, and $20 on the bag. The total amount spent is $30 + $30 + $20 = $80. Therefore, the amount of money she has left is $140 - $80 = $60. 

The final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

First, let's calculate the production for each of the first three weeks:
- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equals \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
- Time spent on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent on makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks is 1128 minutes."
"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the base cost and the additional cost for the extra items.

First, let's calculate the base cost. The base cost includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost for this base installation is $129.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs. She needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

The cost for the additional mirrors is:
\[ 6 \text{ mirrors} \times \$15.00 \text{ per mirror} = \$90.00 \]

The cost for the additional chandeliers is:
\[ 2 \text{ chandeliers} \times \$15.00 \text{ per chandelier} = \$30.00 \]

The cost for the additional pictures is:
\[ 20 \text{ pictures} \times \$15.00 \text{ per picture} = \$300.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the additional items to the base cost:
\[ \$129.00 + \$90.00 + \$30.00 + \$300.00 = \$549.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is:
\[ \$549.00 \]

Let me now present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[
\boxed{549.00}

"Eva has saved $20.00. 

Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + (40% of $30.00) = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final numerical answer is $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from Pompei's lifting capacity to Naruto's.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high.

To convert 480 inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, which is 8 * 4 = 32 miles. Then he travels for another 6 hours, which is 8 * 6 = 48 miles. Therefore, the total distance he has traveled is 32 + 48 = 80 miles. 

\[
\text{Total miles traveled} = 80

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the time it takes them to cross the highway.

Let's denote the speed of each kangaroo as \( v \) and the distance across the highway as \( d \).

Given that it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can write the equation for the distance \( d \) as:
\[ d = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ d = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( d \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t \) be the time it takes for the 4 turtles to travel the distance \( d \). The equation for the distance \( d \) in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \( t \) is:
\[ d = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t \]
\[ d = 2v \times t \]

Since the distance \( d \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set the two expressions for \( d \) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]

We can solve for \( t \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 2v \):
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} \]
\[ t = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway."
"Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes 2 * 40 = 80 clay dishes. Together, they make 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 clay dishes. 

The final numerical answer is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to find in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the apples Adam sliced.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam decided to slice 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam decided to slice 5 small apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ slices} + 15 \text{ slices} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam ate 15 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we need to determine the difference between the desired amount and the current amount:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, I will calculate the length of each partially used glue stick and then subtract that from the original length.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the length of the used part is 1/6 of the original length. The length of the used part is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the unused part is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the length of the used part is 2/3 of the original length. The length of the used part is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the unused part is:
   \[
   12 - 8 = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the length of the used part is 1/2 of the original length. The length of the used part is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the unused part is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, I will add the lengths of the unused parts of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has a total of 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the total cost for the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also buys three packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the total cost for the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total cost for the squirt guns and water balloons is $12 + $9 = $21.

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is $40 - $21 = $19."
"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2S \) socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{D}{2} \) dishes. Since \( D = 60 \), Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Since \( D = 60 \), we can solve for \( S \) as follows:
\[ 60 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]
So, Jack has 30 socks.

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.
- Peter has 30 socks and 30 dishes.

The total number of socks is \( 30 + 30 = 60 \).
The total number of dishes is \( 60 + 30 = 90 \).

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 60 + 90 = 150 \).

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- Total students = 20

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = M + E - \text{Total students} \]
\[ B = 5 + 8 - 20 \]
\[ B = 13 - 20 \]
\[ B = -7 \]

This calculation seems incorrect because it results in a negative number, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the overlap directly.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of those good at math only, those good at English only, and those good at both:
\[ \text{Total students} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only} + \text{Students good at both} \]
\[ 20 = 5 + 8 + B \]
\[ 20 = 13 + B \]
\[ B = 20 - 13 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is 7. Therefore, the total number of students good at math (including those who are good at both) is:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time for one group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time available for the concert:
- Total concert duration: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Subtract the intermission time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform in the available time:
- Total time available: 110 minutes
- Time required for one group: 10 minutes

Number of groups that can perform = Total time available / Time required for one group
Number of groups that can perform = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 3/4 of the original amount = 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

Then, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean those rooms in minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned.
One-half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms.

Step 2: Calculate the total time required to clean those rooms in minutes.
It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so for 45 rooms, it would take 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the homes built in each year: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

Thus, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as \( x \).

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of glue sticks needed and then determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy.

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
   - There are 27 students in the class.
   - Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
   - Therefore, the total number of glue sticks needed is \(27 \times 2 = 54\).

2. Determine how many packs of glue sticks are needed:
   - Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack: \(54 \div 8 = 6.75\).
   - Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

3. Verify the number of glue sticks in 7 packs:
   - 7 packs of 8 glue sticks each will provide \(7 \times 8 = 56\) glue sticks.
   - This will give Mr. Jackson 56 glue sticks, which is 2 extra glue sticks beyond the 54 needed.

Thus, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"The amount of water passing through the river on the first day is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons. On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons from the amount on the second day, which was 8000 gallons.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

"Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns 12 badges in a year.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, Amber earns \(12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6\) badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, in a year, Wendy earns \(12 \times 3 = 36\) badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns: \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she can bake in those 5 hours:
- Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour.
- Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) banana bread loaves.

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from these 10 loaves:
- Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, 10 loaves will yield \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) slices.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 80 slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars.

Given:
- The number of red cars is 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
- The total number of cars is 75.

First, calculate the number of green cars:
\[
\text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of blue cars:
\[
\text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
\]

Now, sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

Finally, subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

First, substitute \( S = A + 25 \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation \( 2A + F = 60 \):
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. To verify, we can find the number of books Anne and Sofie have:
\[ A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \]
\[ S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \]

Now, let's check the total:
\[ S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

1. **Total monthly cost**: $400
2. **Madeline's share**: 60% of $400
   \[
   \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240
   \]
3. **Keenan's share**: The remaining 40% of $400
   \[
   \text{Keenan's share} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160
   \]
4. **Monthly cost per week**: Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month,
   \[
   \text{Monthly cost per week} = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
5. **Keenan's weekly cost**: Since Keenan's share is $160 per month, we divide this by 4 weeks to find the weekly cost.

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use the $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[
\text{Number of meters of the new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since the rope is sold in whole meters, Sarah can buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, let's calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope.

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters of the new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah has to find out how much money she will have left over.

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her present age as \(x\). Therefore, in \(x\) years, her age will be \(8 + x\). We want this to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[8 + x = 3 \times 8\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[8 + x = 24\]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 24 - 8\]

\[x = 16\]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age. The final numerical answer is:

16"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost of the bacon is $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon = $10
- Total cost of chicken = $24
- Total cost of strawberries = $12
- Total cost of apples = $14

Total cost of all items = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is $5."
"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual concerts run for 25 minutes. Let's confirm this by calculating the total runtime of the final concert with this value:

\[ 2 \times 25 + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65 \]

This confirms that the calculation is correct. Therefore, the length of her usual concerts is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones won't be paired. Since 20% of the microphones won't find space, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are to be arranged in pairs, we divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes:

- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the African daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Thus, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Now, we calculate the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Finally, we find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants is 25%."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot per day, let's first establish the costs of the other items Ellen consumes daily.

2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for these items is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot per day is $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's establish the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times and Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6. Since she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the total payment for mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6x \).

Next, we need to find the total earnings from mowing lawns. The total payment for mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for each lawn:
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3x \times \text{price per mow} \)
- Alba's lawn: \( 5x \times \text{price per mow} \)

Since the price per mow for each lawn is not specified, we assume the price per mow is the same for all lawns. Let's denote the price per mow as \( p \).

The total payment for mowing lawns is:
\[ 6 + 3xp + 5xp = 6 + 8xp \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns were $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:
\[ 80 - \text{earnings from lemonade} \]

Since the earnings from lemonade are not specified, we can denote the earnings from lemonade as \( L \). Thus, the earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 80 - L \]

We know the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 6 + 8xp \). Therefore:
\[ 80 - L = 6 + 8xp \]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 80 - (6 + 8xp) \]
\[ L = 80 - 6 - 8xp \]
\[ L = 74 - 8xp \]

Since the problem does not provide the price per mow \( p \), we cannot determine the exact numerical value of \( L \). However, we can conclude that the earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[ \boxed{74 - 8xp} \]

Given the information provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for the earnings from lemonade sales without knowing the price per mow."
"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 per hour, so:

30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from the total earnings:

$750 (total earnings) - $500 (car payment) = $250

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is $250."
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. Therefore, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we first calculate 1/5 of the distance Dijana rowed, and then add that to Dijana's total distance.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

1/5 of 50 miles is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is the sum of the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 110."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get after her husband takes some for himself.

First, Susan made 100 cookies and was going to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. This means we need to divide 100 by 6:

\[ 100 \div 6 = 16 \text{ R } 4 \]

This division tells us that each nephew would get 16 cookies, and there would be 4 cookies left over. However, before Susan could package the cookies, her husband took 4 of the cookies for himself. This means the 4 leftover cookies are now taken by her husband, and the remaining cookies are still to be divided equally among the 6 nephews.

Since the 4 leftover cookies are now taken by the husband, the 100 cookies minus the 4 cookies taken by the husband is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among the 6 nephews:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday, which means she read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today. Daniel was not able to read any pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we add the pages Denise read yesterday and today to the pages Daniel read yesterday and today:

Denise's total pages: \(10 + 18 = 28\)
Daniel's total pages: \(13 + 0 = 13\)

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is in the pot and how much will be left after Calvin, his wife, and their two children have eaten.

First, let's establish the capacity of the pot:
- The pot can fill four adult's bowls.
- The pot can also fill eight child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will eat one bowl of soup as well. This means that two adult bowls of soup have been consumed.

Now, we have two child's bowls of soup left in the pot. Since there are two children, each child can have one bowl of soup.

Therefore, each child will be able to have one bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, I will first calculate the material needed for the small masks and then for the large masks, and then sum them up.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total material needed:**
   - The total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks is \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has purchased. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

9 movies * 3 times each = 27 tickets

Deepa has spent $216 on these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

$216 / 27 tickets = $8 per ticket

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, I will calculate the total time he spends on various activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, I will add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 5."
"Tim originally has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoe boxes, then the number of blue shoe boxes left is:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

If he uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, then the number of red shoe boxes used is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:

\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box. The total number of shoe boxes left is:

\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

The final numerical answer is 10."

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the ages of Duncan and Adam in the past.

Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Let Adam's current age be \( A \). Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. In 8 years, Adam will be:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Therefore, the size of Farmer Smith's farm is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \times \text{Size of Farmer Brown's farm} + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \times 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

The total size of both farms is the sum of the sizes of Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms:

\[ \text{Total size} = \text{Size of Farmer Brown's farm} + \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} \]
\[ \text{Total size} = 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. Therefore, the time spent on an extreme sudoku is:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we divide 180 minutes by 30:

180 minutes / 30 minutes/half-hour = 6 half-hour intervals

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in that time."
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \).

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so he threw \( 2R \) pieces of bologna at the red balloons.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so he threw \( 3Y \) pieces of bologna at the yellow balloons.
- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
- The number of red balloons is 20.

We can set up the following equation based on the total pieces of bologna thrown:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Given that \( R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first need to calculate the total distance Jon drives in that period.

Jon drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, so the total distance driven is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups are needed:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, I will calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, to find the total number of hours worked over the three days, I will add the hours worked each day:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is 23."
"Let's break down the expenses and the money they spent:

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5 to buy, so the total cost is:

300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$240 (revenue) - $150 (cost) = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. 

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to determine how many trips he can make in that time. 

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours and he wants to collect 24 berries, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water in the tank:**
   - The pool has 10000 gallons of water.
   - Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   - Half of 10000 gallons is 5000 gallons.

2. **Determine the rate of water being emptied from the tank:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

3. **Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days:**
   - The tank starts with 5000 gallons.
   - In 6 days, 500 gallons are emptied each day.
   - Total water emptied in 6 days is \( 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \).
   - Therefore, the remaining water in the tank after 6 days is \( 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \).

The final numerical answer is 2000 gallons."
"Given the constraints, let's break down the expenses and the remaining budget:

- Colby has $150 to spend.
- He has already spent money on 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub, so 2 tubs cost $16.
- Candy costs $2 per box, so 4 boxes cost $8.
- Therefore, Colby has already spent $16 + $8 = $24.
- This leaves him with $150 - $24 = $126 to spend.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the movie he is going to watch tonight:
- It is a Friday, so the ticket costs $10.
- He also wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.

So, the total cost for tonight's movie is $10 (ticket) + $10 (popcorn and candy) = $20.

Subtracting this from the remaining budget:
- $126 - $20 = $106.

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $106. Let's assume he wants to see as many movies as possible, and each movie ticket costs $7 (since it's not a Friday or Saturday).

- The number of additional movies he can see is $106 / $7 = 15.142857...

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 15 more movies.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is:
- 5 (already seen on Friday or Saturday) + 15 (additional movies) = 20 movies.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, I will first calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days, and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, I will add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

The total number of toys for her nephew is 62.

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: \( P + Q + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Q = J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Q + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100, \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100. \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80. \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20. \]

Now, we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:
\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30, \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

Thus, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years."
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria herself had 1 water balloon. So, before her mom gave them more balloons, the total number of water balloons was \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(9 + 15 = 24\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of boxes donated is:
10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

They also have 10 boxes of their own stuff, so the total number of boxes is:
50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (owned) = 60 boxes

Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. Therefore, the number of tables needed to display all the boxes is:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:
30 tables needed - 15 tables owned = 15 new tables

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

Zoey's total distance:
Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet.
\[ 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney's total distance:
Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet.
\[ 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we find the average total distance by adding the total distances and dividing by the number of people (which is 2).

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 + 420}{2} = \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total production and revenue for each machine over a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets:
- Each widget sells for $6.

Total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets:
- Each widget sells for $6.

Total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron's stay is from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after the first 12 hours. 

First, we calculate the cost for the first 12 hours:
1000 pesos

Next, we calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours):
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Adding these together gives the total cost for Cameron's stay:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour option, the cost would be 1600 pesos. 

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the total cost of his chosen option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:

John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, John can buy 4 pens. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"In the ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply by the number of rows for each school.

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from the coupons.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from the coupons is:
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:
\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ 842 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 842 \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, we sum these components:

- Visit fee: $40
- Labor cost: $105
- Parts cost: $60

Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

Therefore, Patty's Plumbing charged $205 for this job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, James gets a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $150:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

Subtracting the discount from the original total cost gives us the amount James actually paid:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs before the discount is:

5 CDs * $15/CD = $75

Since he sells these 5 CDs for $40, he loses:

$75 - $40 = $35

Therefore, the total amount of money James was out is the sum of the money he paid for the CDs and the loss from selling the 5 CDs:

$90 + $35 = $125

So, the final numerical answer is $125."
"To calculate the earnings, I will multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, I will add these amounts to find the total earnings:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part.

1. **Swimming Across the Lake:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - Distance swum = 20 * 0.60 = 12 miles.
   - Speed = 2 miles per hour.
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Resting on the Island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Time resting = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. **Swimming the Remaining Distance:**
   - Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
   - Speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   - Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time swimming 12 miles + Time resting + Time swimming remaining 8 miles.
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, and then subtract 40 from that number.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. Therefore, seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:

70 * 7 = 490

Now, subtract 40 from 490:

490 - 40 = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left. Then she received 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so she had 8 + 5 = 13 stickers at the end.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- He sells 6 copies.
- Each copy costs $5.
- His commission rate is 10%.

The commission from each New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

For 6 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- He sells 10 copies.
- Each copy costs $15.
- His commission rate is 8%.

The commission from each Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

For 10 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ 15.00 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Marcus is also half of Leo's age, so Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the fact that each page is printed on both sides of the paper.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each page is printed on both sides of the paper.
- The stack of paper is 100 pages to the inch.

First, we calculate the number of pages in the stack that corresponds to the thickness of the book:
\[ \text{Number of pages in the stack} = \text{Thickness of the book} \times \text{Pages per inch} \]
\[ \text{Number of pages in the stack} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]
\[ \text{Number of pages in the stack} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

Since each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \text{Total number of pages} = \text{Number of pages in the stack} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of pages} = 150 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of pages} = 300 \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"Vince started stapling reports at 8:00 AM and continued until 11:00 PM. The total time he worked is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours.

15 hours = 15 * 60 minutes = 900 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the number of minutes it takes to staple 30 reports:

900 minutes / 15 minutes per 30 reports = 60 intervals.

Since each interval results in 30 reports being stapled, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To calculate the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to consider her usual sleep duration and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

She usually wakes up at 6 a.m., which is 180 minutes after she goes to sleep at 10 p.m.

On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. This means she spent 55 minutes awake before she went to the bathroom.

She also sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Therefore, the total time she was awake that day is 55 minutes (early wake-up) + 23 minutes (sleepwalking) = 78 minutes.

Subtracting the time she was awake from her usual sleep duration gives us the time she slept on her bed: 480 minutes (usual sleep duration) - 78 minutes (time awake) = 402 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 402 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[
9 - 6 = 3 \text{ emails}
\]

One-third of these remaining 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email}
\]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Shawna's age.
2. Use Shawna's age to find out her father's age.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

If Courtney reported 48 people, then 20% of 48 is calculated as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Since Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we subtract this 20% from the reported number:

\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4. However, since the number of people must be a whole number, and considering the context of a concert where fractional people are not possible, we can conclude that the closest whole number to 38.4 is 38 or 39. Given the precision of the calculation, we should report the exact value as 38.4.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 38.4 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:

- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31

Now, let's determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:

- Holes dug on the first day: 10

So, at the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.

Next, let's calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day:

- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31

Now, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day:

- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Four times the number of holes at the end of the first day: 4 * 10 = 40

This means that the number of holes at the end of the third day should be 40, but we calculated it to be 31. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes at the end of the third day is 31 - 2 = 29.

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day:

- Holes at the end of the third day: 29
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10

Holes dug on the fourth day = 29 - 10 = 19

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 19."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number Amora and Lainey received, we can write:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we sum the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:

"The cost of the supplies is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the travel tickets, we calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the original $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]

\[
S = 160 - 13
\]

\[
S = 147
\]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode.

It is also stated that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes in total. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:
\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance she traveled in each leg of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs of the journey to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To determine the number of individual brownies Greta had left over, I will calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received:

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   - 1 dozen = 12 brownies.

2. At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   - 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies.

3. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
   - 4 dozen = 48 brownies.

Adding these together:
- 12 brownies (from herself) + 6 brownies (from office) + 48 brownies (from friends) = 66 brownies.

Next, we calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
- 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 dozen = 18 brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
- 66 brownies - 18 brownies = 48 brownies.

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"Nani's brother is twice his age, so the brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, the sister is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years old.

The total age of all three family members is Nani's age + his brother's age + his sister's age, which is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years."
"To calculate the total time Andy will take to restring all the racquets, I will calculate the time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now, I will add up the times:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break down the cost:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many wooden slats are required. Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of slats \( S \) required is:

\[
S = 2 \times P
\]

Substituting the perimeter \( P \):

\[
S = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Thus, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:

12 boxes

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:

2 + 2 = 4 boxes

So, the number of boxes she kept for herself is:

12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she kept is:

8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges she kept:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

160 oranges were kept, so the number of oranges sold is:

240 oranges - 160 oranges = 80 oranges

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 80."
"To solve this, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Now, let's find out how many states India has. The question states that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of the number of states in the USA is 50 / 2 = 25. Therefore, India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in India to the number of states in the USA: 50 + 29 = 79.

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, I will calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to earn is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount saved
Remaining amount = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's start by determining how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then calculate the earnings.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each type of baked good:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15/box = $90

Total earnings for gingerbread over two days:
- Saturday: $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
- Total: $60 + $90 = $150

Total earnings for apple pie over two days:
- Saturday: 6 boxes * $15/box = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225
- Total: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for both gingerbread and apple pie over two days:
- Total: $150 + $315 = $465

Therefore, the total amount Sunny earned for two days is $465."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days.

1. Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour.
2. She is outside for 4 hours each day.
3. Therefore, she uses \( 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \).
4. Over 8 days, she will use \( 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover 32 ounces of sunscreen.

1. Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
2. To find the number of bottles needed, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: \( \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \).

Therefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the cost of the red car, I will calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - 40% of the price of the blue car
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, I will add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car.

Total cost = Price of the red car + Price of the blue car
Total cost = $60 + $100 = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as \( D \) and the current age of his brother as \( B \).

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19, he will turn 24 in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years.

At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne received:
- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

"First, let's determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we find the number of students who are not football players. This is the total number of students minus the number of football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Given that 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

Finally, we add the number of football players to the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the two boots, we add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, as the growth of the flowers is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet between every plant. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 1.5 feet is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we need to consider the space taken up by the plants themselves and the space between them. If we place the first plant at the start of the flower bed, the next plant will be 18 inches away, the next one 36 inches away, and so on. This forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 12 inches (the width of the first plant), the common difference (d) is 18 inches (the space between plants), and the last term (l) is 1332 inches (the length of the flower bed).

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a + (n - 1)d \]

Setting \( a_n = 1332 \), we can solve for \( n \):
\[ 1332 = 12 + (n - 1) \cdot 18 \]
\[ 1332 = 12 + 18n - 18 \]
\[ 1332 = 18n - 6 \]
\[ 1338 = 18n \]
\[ n = \frac{1338}{18} \]
\[ n = 74.3333 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we take the floor value, which is 74. This means 74 plants can fit in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy \( 74 - 17 = 57 \) more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 57 plants is:
\[ 57 \times 6 = 342 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $342 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many, we calculate:
\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel intake} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To calculate the total cost, I will first determine the cost of the flowers for one basket, and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

- Total cost for five baskets = $14.00 * 5 = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is:
- Remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
- Number of roses = Remaining soil for roses = 3.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, I will calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes.

She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck, which is:

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for fancy shoes.

Next, I will calculate how much she can spend on shoes in a year:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, I will divide her yearly budget by the cost of one pair of shoes:

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: Let's assume the initial temperature of the room is 100 degrees.

2. **Air Conditioner on Low for 3 Hours**:
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour.
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).
   - New temperature: \(100 - 6 = 94 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Air Conditioner on High for 4 Hours**:
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour.
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).
   - New temperature: \(94 - 12 = 82 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Air Conditioner Off for 2 Hours**:
   - The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Final temperature: \(82 + 4 = 86 \text{ degrees}\).

5. **Final Temperature Difference**:
   - The starting temperature was 100 degrees.
   - The final temperature is 86 degrees.
   - The difference: \(100 - 86 = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the room was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Thus, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes in a year, I will calculate the number of checks he writes for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 24 church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, I will sum up all the checks:

- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \), and the number of flights to France and Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) each.

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France. Since the remaining \( \frac{1}{4}F \) flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we will first calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds.
   - \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls.
   - Combined duration: \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) = \( 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves' howls.
   - Total duration: \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) + \( 60 \) seconds (Igneous) = \( 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert the Total Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - \( 120 \) seconds divided by \( 60 \) seconds per minute = \( 2 \) minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \( 2 \) minutes."
"Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father is $6 + $12 = $18. Adam bought trousers for $30, so the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

\[

"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = 4 years
- Helene's age = \( H \) years
- Wilfred's age = \( W \) years

The total age of the children is given as 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \), we get:
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
Solving for \( W \), we find:
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

The total amount collected from these two sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on the clinic rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time for rounds is:

9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time he will spend on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time for appointments is:

10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes

To convert the total time spent from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

9 hours (total time at clinic) - 8 hours (time spent on rounds and appointments) = 1 hour

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, I will add up the total time required for each step and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, and Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes. Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars.

The total number of chocolate bars sold can be expressed as:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \( 8 \)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, as well as the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:
- Fixed cost of renting the studio: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a week and in a month:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the number of sessions in a month is: 3 days/session * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40/session * 12 sessions = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[
4p = 64
\]
\[
7m = 56
\]

To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the first equation by 4:
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the second equation by 7:
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50, the number of female porcupines is:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To calculate the volume of the swimming pool, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × depth. Given the dimensions of the pool, the volume is:

\[ 14 \text{ feet} \times 25 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, to find the cost to fill the pool, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

\[ 8260 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.10 \text{ per gallon} = \$826.00 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \$826.00."
"To find the total number of sticks, we will first determine the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
   \[
   9 + 14 + 11 = 34

"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

2. **Total water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda and Ms. B together pumped \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

Next, let's determine how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day.

3. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

4. **Total water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda and Ms. B together pumped \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

5. **Total water pumped in two days:**
   - Together, they pumped \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

6. **Remaining water in the tank:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining water is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge after the first 5 hours. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times x \]

We can cancel \( x \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we calculate the values:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ x \times 0.536 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, I will first calculate her total weekly earnings, then determine how much she saves each week, and finally calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000 (20% of $10000).

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:
   - Wages: $10/hour * 40 hours = $400
   - Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours = $600
   - Total weekly earnings: $400 + $600 = $1000

2. Calculate how much Janet saves each week:
   - Savings: 20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000:
   - Number of weeks = $2000 / $200 = 10 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work 10 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\)
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these costs together gives the total spent so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has:

15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Now, we need to divide the 13 packs equally among her 10 friends:

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces each friend received:

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% annually, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures. She divided these pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums being selfies only and 2 albums being portraits only. This means the remaining albums must be for other types of pictures, but we are not concerned with those for this calculation.

Let's denote the number of selfies as \( S \) and the number of portraits as \( P \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ S + P = 72 \]

We also know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Since the total number of pictures is 72, we can write:

\[ 3S + 2P = 72 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + P = 72 \)
2. \( 3S + 2P = 72 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( P \) in terms of \( S \):

\[ P = 72 - S \]

Substitute \( P \) in the second equation:

\[ 3S + 2(72 - S) = 72 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 3S + 144 - 2S = 72 \]
\[ S + 144 = 72 \]
\[ S = 72 - 144 \]
\[ S = -72 \]

This result is not possible since the number of selfies cannot be negative. Let's recheck the equations and the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the total number of selfies and portraits is 72, and the total number of pictures in the albums is 72. Since 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be for other types of pictures.

Let's solve the system again:

From the first equation:
\[ P = 72 - S \]

Substitute into the second equation:
\[ 3S + 2(72 - S) = 72 \]
\[ 3S + 144 - 2S = 72 \]
\[ S + 144 = 72 \]
\[ S = 72 - 144 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 24 \) back into the first equation to find \( P \):
\[ P = 72 - 24 \]
\[ P = 48 \]

So, Olivia had 24 selfies and 48 portraits. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{24 \text{ selfies and } 48 \text{ portraits}}

\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \)."
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to find out how many sandwiches are eaten per day by the entire family, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, I will calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, her total earnings are:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, I will calculate the total amount she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since there were 100 eggs hidden in total, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(40 \times 18 = 720\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes would mine \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds of ore in a month.

The final numerical answer is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the cost of the new bedroom set after selling the old one is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Tom has to pay 10% of this amount as a monthly payment. 

To find 10% of $2000, we calculate:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Red: 25
   - Green: 7
   - Yellow: 12

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - 40% of 25 red balloons burst.
   - 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10
   - Remaining red balloons: 25 - 10 = 15

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Half of the 12 yellow balloons were released.
   - Half of 12 = 0.5 * 12 = 6
   - Remaining yellow balloons: 12 - 6 = 6

4. **Blue Balloons Added:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons.
   - She added 75% of these blue balloons to her collection.
   - 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.5
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.5

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6

3. **Extension Requests:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% or 0.2 chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to accept his dog-ate-the-assignment excuse.
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 60% or 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48
   - The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 60% or 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12

4. **Total Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
   - Probability of having the normal teacher and not having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.5 * 0.48 = 0.24
   - Total probability of not having to turn in homework: 0.25 + 0.24 = 0.49

5. **Probability of Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - Probability of having to turn in homework: 1 - Total probability of not having to turn in homework = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 51%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This is the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center minus the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

First, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find the number of tickets that can be distributed to the graduates and their guests:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

This means there are 4750 tickets available to be distributed to the graduates and their guests. If we assume that each graduate will give one ticket to each of their friends and family members, and we want to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we need to know the number of friends and family members each graduate will give a ticket to. However, since the question does not specify the number of friends and family members each graduate will give a ticket to, we can only determine the total number of tickets available for distribution.

If we assume that each graduate will give a ticket to each of their friends and family members, and we want to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to know the number of graduates. Let's denote the number of graduates as \( G \).

The total number of tickets (4750) is to be distributed equally among the graduates. Therefore, each graduate will receive:

\[ \frac{4750}{G} \]

Without the number of graduates, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume that the question is asking for the total number of tickets available for distribution, the answer is:

\[ 4750 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"First, I will calculate the total time Melissa spends listening to the court case. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total time is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, I will calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, I will calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, I subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, I divide her total earnings after expenses by the total hours she spent:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, the total number of trips he will make is 7.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time required is:

\[
7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds per trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{35}

"To solve this, first, we need to find the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples he can make with 80 apples. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese:

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years.

Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine the income Jim lost during his college years. Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job. After college, his income tripled, so his new income is:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

The income Jim lost each year while in college is the difference between his old and new income:
\[ 75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000 \]

Since Jim was in college for 4 years, the total income he lost is:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover both the amount borrowed and the income lost. This is the sum of the loan amount and the income lost:
\[ 200,000 + 200,000 = 400,000 \]

Jim's new income after college is $75,000 per year. To find out how many years it will take for Jim to earn $400,000 at this rate, we divide the total amount needed by his annual income:
\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, I will calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric and then find the area of each piece.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

For the first piece of fabric:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

For the second piece of fabric:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, I will calculate the area of each piece of fabric:
- Area of the first piece: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet
- Area of the second piece: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Finally, I will add the areas of both pieces of fabric to find the total amount of fabric Jim needs:
- Total area: 80 square feet + 80 square feet = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday based on the information provided, and then sum the total for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
- On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.
- On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
- One-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
- Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

Next, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
- Twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
- Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, let's sum the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
- Monday: 425 letters
- Tuesday: 102 letters
- Wednesday: 209 letters

Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The final numerical answer is 736."
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately, and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

First, let's summarize the details of each race:
- On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
- On the second race, Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. Therefore, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.
- On the third race, Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. Therefore, Johnny's dad lost $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.50

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
Average amount lost per race = $21.50 / 3 = $7.16666667

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

Therefore, the total population is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 130000 \]

Thus, the total population of South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert the heights to the same unit of measurement. Since Xavier's height is given in feet and inches, and Cole's height is given in inches, we will convert Xavier's height to inches.

Xavier's height in inches:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's height is already given in inches, which is 50 inches.

Now, we find the difference between Xavier's and Cole's heights:
51 inches - 50 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they divided is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

Therefore, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

\[
\boxed{420}

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, let's convert the fraction of a day into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The painters worked for 3 weeks, which is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

So, the total hours of work for the team over the 3 weeks is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, the total work hours distributed among them is 189 hours. Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked is:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 47.25 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms again:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set."
"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we can use the formula for depreciation:

- Initial Price = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.4930399 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 9860.798 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9861."

4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required.

The area of each tile is 1 ft x 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.

Therefore, the number of tiles needed is 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12.

The total cost is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

Thus, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"To calculate the cost James pays for insurance a year, we first need to determine the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find the increased cost, we calculate 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we first need to calculate the number of loads he does in a week.

A twin set of sheets consists of 2 twin beds, so 4 twin beds would be 2 twin sets. A king set of sheets consists of 1 king bed.

Greg puts clean sheets on 2 twin sets and 1 king set of sheets every week. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, he will need to do 1 load of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:

\[ 1 \text{ load/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 52 \text{ loads/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. Therefore, on Sunday, they watch:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

So, in one weekend, they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so before collecting those, he had 100 - 50 = 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is 50 (from last year) + 100 (this year) = 150 stickers. 

\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day:
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
- Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}\) per day.
- For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \text{ grams} \times 3 = 360 \text{ grams}\) per day.

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
- We have 720 grams of cat food.
- The daily consumption is 360 grams.
- Therefore, the number of days the cat food will last is \(720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days}\).

Thus, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 31 \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time taken for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the 30-minute visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours, which is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we sum these amounts:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James does not respond to 16 emails a day. Therefore, the number of emails he does respond to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, I will add the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, which is \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, I will add these numbers together:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, I will add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, I will add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, I will add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, I will add 222 and 25:

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score across the 4 tests, I will add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, I will add these scores together:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, I will divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as follows:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some is:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering more is:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining meatball sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that was supposed to be delivered was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after the trucks had departed, a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 trucks is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

These 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs, then determine the cost based on the promotion.

Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis pays for one pound and gets the second pound at half price.

Let's calculate the cost:

- Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
- For every two pounds, he pays for one pound and gets the second pound at half price.
- So, for 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 pounds at full price and get 3 pounds at half price.

The cost for 3 pounds at full price is:
3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

The cost for 3 pounds at half price is:
3 pounds * $4.00/pound * 0.5 = $6.00

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
$12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

Therefore, the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Now, we need to subtract the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will come = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest beyond 20.

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests:

- Total cost = $125 (base rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

Therefore, the party will cost $251."
"Let's assume Maggie had M dollars and Riza had R dollars. According to the problem, M = $60 and R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times M = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, Maggie has \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times R = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, Riza has \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars left.

Together, they have \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars left.

The final numerical answer is 85."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the daily banana consumption of each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. The total number of bananas consumed by the first and second monkeys in a day is \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas.
4. Since Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, the third monkey must eat the remaining bananas. Therefore, the third monkey eats \(315 - 24 = 291\) bananas each day.

Thus, the third monkey eats 291 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He then finished another 500-piece puzzle, placing 500 pieces. Therefore, during that hour, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \left\lfloor \frac{15}{12} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ dozen} \]
\[ \text{Cost for 1 dozen} = \$15 \]
\[ \text{Cost for 3 roses} = 3 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$6 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$15 + \$6 = \$21 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

The change she should receive is:

\[ \$25 - \$21 = \$4 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters make up $4. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:

\[ \frac{\$4}{\$0.25} = 16 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"First, I will calculate the total earnings from each item Terry sells:

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, I will add these amounts to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

The final numerical answer is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, I will calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the duration of Paul's wait.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (1/4 * 20 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 + 20 = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since he arrives at the station at 0 minutes, the time he needs to wait is:

\[ 85 - 0 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 85 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch from him at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid. So, we calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend received. The original price of the watch was $2000, and he paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ 10\% \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.

First, let's understand the rate at which each spring creates jellyfish. Since a single spring creates one jellyfish every second, we need to find out how many jellyfish one spring can create in 4 hours.

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are:
\[ 60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds in an hour} \]
Therefore, in 4 hours, there are:
\[ 4 \times 3600 = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]
Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
\[ 14400 \text{ jellyfish} \]

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours will be:
\[ 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72000 \]"
"Binkie's score was 90. Twice as high as Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\). Frankie's score was 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

The final numerical answer is 195."
"Let's break down the journey:

1. James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. The total distance he walks is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.
4. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took him to reach the store, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the time it took him to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:

40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and Jenny buys 10 bunches, the total cost is:

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the growth rate of the crocodile per year, and then use that rate to find the growth over 13 years.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find the growth over 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

1. **Trekking bikes:**
   - Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Total bikes sold = 300
   - Number of Trekking bikes sold = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)

2. **BMX bikes:**
   - 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes sold = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)

3. **MTB bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Number of Trekking bikes sold - Number of BMX bikes sold
   - Number of MTB bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = Half the price of an MTB bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)

3. **Earnings from MTB bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings for the month:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 32500 = 111250
\]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply that by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Therefore, the net number of bales of hay added to the field each hour is:

5 bales (farmer) - 3 bales (truck) = 2 bales per hour.

If they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is:

2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 12 bales."
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of periods John has to attend:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each period is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

The final numerical answer is 28.33 hours."
"First, let's determine the height from which Nathan drops the ball. The third-floor balcony is 3 stories high, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce. Therefore, the height of the second bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 32 \]"
"To find the height of the fourth child, let's first convert all heights to inches for easier calculation.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to calculate the number of bags sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means that \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"To calculate the cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Given that a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 8.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is \( \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \).

To express this as a percentage, we calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \).

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up. 

In 3 hours, the first train will have traveled \(60 \times 3 = 180\) miles, and the second train will have traveled \(30 \times 3 = 90\) miles. 

Therefore, after 3 hours, the total distance between the two trains will be the sum of the distances each has traveled, which is \(180 + 90 = 270\) miles. 

\[
\boxed{270}

"To calculate the number of people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Calculate the number of days Billy works, given that he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps, given that he can help 2 people per hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:

- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Next, calculate the number of days Billy works:

- Billy takes 20% off, so he works 80% of the days.
- Number of days he works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

Now, calculate the total number of hours Billy works:

- He works 3 hours a day.
- Total hours = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours.

Finally, calculate the total number of people he helps:

- He can help 2 people per hour.
- Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people.

Therefore, the total number of people Billy helps is 240."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two quantities.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

\[
12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

Now, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[
420 + 60 = 480
\]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is:

\[
\boxed{480}

"To find out how old Jeff is, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.
2. Now, since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, I will first calculate the daily total and then multiply by 5.

Bobby's daily break time is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
His daily lunch time is 30 minutes.

So, his total daily break and lunch time is 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.

Over 5 days, his total break and lunch time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate how many miles Micah ran, and then subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Amber ran 8 miles.

Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so:
\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

The total miles run by Amber and Micah is:
\[ \text{Amber's miles} + \text{Micah's miles} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total miles run by all three is 52 miles, so:
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. Therefore, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of frying pan: $16.00
4. Cost of set of towels: $27.00
5. New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{5}T \text{ are large jellyfish.} \]

And a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{5}T \right) = \frac{1}{15}T \text{ jellyfish change color.} \]

We are told that 6 jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on. Therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{15}T = 6. \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 = 90. \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, Ben is 4 * 2 = 8 years old. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 8 * 3 = 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, I need to calculate the amount Lauren saves each year, her annual expenses, and then determine how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, Lauren saves $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

Next, let's calculate her annual expenses:
- She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
- Therefore, her annual expenses are $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

Now, let's determine how much she needs to save for her retirement:
- She plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years.
- She needs to save enough to cover her expenses for 20 years.
- Therefore, she needs to save $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Finally, let's calculate how many years she needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, she needs to work $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Lauren needs to work 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"To solve this problem, I will follow the steps as instructed:

1. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon.
2. He cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, I divide 100 centimeters by 4:
   100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.
3. Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, I divide 25 centimeters by 5:
   25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm
   Therefore, each of the final cut parts is 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is 5 centimeters."
"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school. Given that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]

Let's solve for the total number of students:

\[ \text{Total Students} = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

\[ \text{Total Students} = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Students} - \text{Number of Boys} \]

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 \]

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."

The total height of all heels is:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

The total number of heels is:
3 heels + 3 heels = 6 heels

The average height of the heels is:
18 inches / 6 heels = 3 inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in June and the total number of days in June.

June has 30 days. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Let's calculate the total number of miles she can hike in June if she walks twice a day, 125 miles each time.

Total miles per day if she walks twice: \(125 \times 2 = 250\) miles.
Total miles in June: \(250 \times 30 = 7500\) miles.

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles in June, but she can only hike 7,500 miles if she walks twice a day. Therefore, the number of additional miles she needs to hike per day is:

\[
\frac{9300 - 7500}{30} = \frac{1800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles per day}
\]

Thus, the number of additional miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To calculate the total amount the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the number of each color of ball by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the red balls:
3 red balls * $9 per red ball = $27

For the blue balls:
11 blue balls * $5 per blue ball = $55

For the green balls:
25 green balls * $3 per green ball = $75

Now, we add these amounts together:
$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"It seems there is a bit of confusion in the question. There are three individuals mentioned: Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but the question asks about James. Also, the question does not mention James at all. It appears that the question might be asking about the amount of apples that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have left after Pierre and Paul have taken their shares, but it does not specify how much James will have.

Let's assume the question is asking how much apples Pierre and Paul will have taken, and we will calculate that.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the total apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul have taken:
\[ \text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the amount of apples that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have left is:
\[ \text{Apples left} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ kg} \]"

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, I will perform the following calculations:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved $11 from his allowance, so his total money became $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He spent $5 on a comic book, so his total money became $32 - $5 = $27.
4. He spent $19 on a puzzle, so his total money became $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each book cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases.
2. Calculate the total amount of money she spent on the books.
3. Divide the total amount spent on the books by the number of books to find the cost of each book.

First, Anna started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount she has spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

She has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. To find the number of students enrolled this year, we calculate the increase and add it to the number of students from last year.

20% of 50 students is calculated as follows:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. Therefore, the total number of students enrolled this year is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the rate of blinking and then use that rate to find the time required for 459 blinks.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, to find out how long it will take for 459 blinks at this rate, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes is:
16 - 11 = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia's chore was mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume the time Dior took is \(4 + x\) hours, where \(x > 4\). For simplicity, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours but less than 16 hours, which is a common assumption in such problems).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

"To determine the number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time:**
   John drives for 2 hours to visit his parents.

2. **Determine the speed:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}

Therefore, the number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is 280 miles."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk a total of 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. 

So, in 7 days, Brian will walk 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is:
\[12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

However, we calculated that the first 4 workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the difference:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

Since the fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, the number of toys the fifth worker must produce per hour is:
\[\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of both dogs} = 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he kept, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \).

Solving for \( S \):
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, I will calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He has 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, I will determine how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, I will figure out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms/small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

Half of the earth's circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we first need to determine the speed of the second fastest car, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the second fastest car is:
   \[
   5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
   \[
   1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. At that time, his age was twice the age of Vince. Therefore, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. 

To find Vince's current age, we add the two years that have passed since then:

7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

\[
\boxed{9}

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each.

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes gives us the total weight:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, I will calculate the length of the logs John can make from the tree.

The tree is 80 feet tall. He can make logs out of 80% of the tree, so the length of the logs is:
\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, John cuts the 64-foot logs into 4-foot logs. The number of 4-foot logs he can get from the 64-foot logs is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Then, from each of these 4-foot logs, he cuts 5 planks. The total number of planks he gets is:
\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, he sells each plank for $1.2. The total amount of money he makes is:
\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$96 \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly salary of Valerie's brother.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine the monthly salary of their mother.
4. Sum the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns twice that amount:
\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, the time spent on the beach is given by:
\[ \text{Time on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{2}{v} \text{ minutes} \]

We are given that this time is 40 minutes:
\[ \frac{2}{v} = 40 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find the speed on the sidewalk. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. Therefore, she still needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save $28 is:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, I will add up the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: 3 * 7 = 21
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: 2 * 4 = 8
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: 1 * 3 = 3

Now, I will add these numbers together to find the total number of blue birds:

21 + 8 + 3 = 32

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the remaining amount of water in the 33-degree mug is \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees.

He then pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. This means the remaining amount of water in the second mug is \( T - 1 \) degrees.

Since the water in the water bottle is now drinkable, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. The temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the 29-degree water and the 1-degree water from the second mug. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[
\frac{29 + 1}{2} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{30}{2} \geq 40
\]

\[
15 \geq 40
\]

This inequality is not true, so we need to find the minimum temperature \( T \) such that the average temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the bottle as \( x \). Then we have:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{2} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{28 + T}{2} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

\[
28 + T \geq 80
\]

Subtracting 28 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 52
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 52 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{52}
\]"
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens, which totals to 70 animals.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Adding the animals brought in over the three weeks to the initial number of animals, we get:

Initial animals: 70
Cows added: 420
Chickens added: 210

Total animals after three weeks: 70 + 420 + 210 = 700

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"To calculate the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to determine the total cost of the bagels and then divide by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount is:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

With a 10% discount, the total cost becomes:
\[ \$40.00 - (10\% \times \$40.00) = \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

The total number of bagels in 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Therefore, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36} = \$1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Calculation:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Calculation:
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

It is given that 3 less than 6 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Calculation:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

Calculation:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate for 18 scoops, we multiply the number of potatoes per scoop by the number of scoops:

Calculation:
1.5 potatoes/scoop * 18 scoops = 27 potatoes

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is 27."
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Jess can see that there are 17 green jelly beans.
2. There are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, so there are \(2 \times 17 = 34\) red jelly beans.
3. The total number of jelly beans is 60.
4. The number of blue jelly beans can be found by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans.

So, the number of blue jelly beans is \(60 - 17 - 34 = 60 - 51 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

4. Calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Tim grows 5 trees.
Step 2: Each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree.
Step 3: In one year, the total number of lemons collected from all trees is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 4: In a decade (10 years), the total number of lemons collected is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 300."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84, so we can write the equation:
\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]
\[ 14x = 84 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \( 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women = \( 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12.

Faraday earns $56 from the bouquet sales per day. To find the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8 \text{ per bouquet}} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earns $26 from the sunflower sales per day.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2 \text{ per sunflower}} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from both the bouquets and the sunflowers:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 84 \text{ sunflowers from bouquets} + 13 \text{ sunflowers from sunflowers} = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days} = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 291 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
\[ \boxed{291} \]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue if Adam sells all 20 rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$140
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue if Adam only sells 60% of his inventory:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$84

Therefore, Adam loses \(\boxed{56}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of days it will take for Lauren to complete the project, I will calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

For large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For small-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, I will sum the days required for each type of picture scene:

"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket, then calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners, and finally express that probability as a percentage.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is 3 times the probability of winning for the first ticket. 

\[ \text{Probability of winning for the second ticket} = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket being a winner:

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets being winners} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we find \( 22 = 2R \), and solving for \( R \), we get \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally between themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells."
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and on weekends separately, and then sum them up.

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it is 5 minutes plus 60% of 5 minutes. 

To calculate the length of the second song:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} \times 60\% = 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time for the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"To determine Linus's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of each mobile device. He buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices. Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so he bought a total of:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The revenue from selling all 6 devices at $40 each is:

\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the 6 devices. Each device costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ 120 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know Isabel's height and the relationships between the heights of Carl, Ned, and Isabel.

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.

Now, we know Carl's height is 6 feet. The cane is half as long as Carl is tall, so the length of the cane is \(6 / 2 = 3\) feet.

The final numerical answer is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required. Each bottle can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles Hortex would have to produce is 7300."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue.

Carla has 8 babies in total. 

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies.

Next, we calculate how many of the babies wear bows. 

- All the babies dressed in blue (2) also wear bows.
- 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) babies.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"To find the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

Therefore, the number of tax reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land that Abraham sold. He initially owned 80 square meters of land.

1. Abraham sold half of his land:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold this land for $50.

2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold this land for $30.

3. The remaining land is:
   \[
   80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold this land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each sale:

- From the first sale:
  \[
  40 \text{ square meters} \times \$50/\text{square meter} = \$2000
  \]

- From the second sale:
  \[
  20 \text{ square meters} \times \$30/\text{square meter} = \$600
  \]

- From the third sale:
  \[
  20 \text{ square meters} \times \$3/\text{square meter} = \$60
  \]

Finally, we sum up the total money earned from all sales:
\[
\$2000 + \$600 + \$60 = \$2660
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{2660}
\]"
"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- He goes out three times a day.

So, the number of times he changes his face mask in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ times per go out} \times 3 \text{ go outs per day} = 6 \text{ times per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times he changes his face mask in 2 days:
\[ 6 \text{ times per day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times in 2 days} \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs that Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

Total eggs found = 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:

Eggs still hidden = 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
2. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
3. Calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes.
4. Calculate the total number of garbage collections per week.
5. Calculate the total amount of money John makes per week.

Step 1: The first two complexes have 200 apartments each.
   Total for the first two complexes = 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Step 2: The third complex has 60% more apartments than the first two combined.
   60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.
   Total for the third complex = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 3: Total number of apartments in all three complexes.
   Total = 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Step 4: John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex.
   Total collections per week = 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

Step 5: John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   Total money made per week = 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $1248."
"To calculate the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 50 \times 7 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 50 \times 20 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 50 \times 20 = 1000 \) fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:

- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced = \( 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 \) fruits.

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"Jack initially had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. Therefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120. 

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first relationship into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second relationship into the equation above:
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars, since Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie.

Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12\]

From this, we can solve for \(x\):
\[15 - x = 12\]
\[x = 15 - 12 = 3\]

So, each of them gave 3 dollars to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had 5 dollars, and he gave 3 dollars to his sister:
\[5 - 3 = 2\]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[2\]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of the house, I will first calculate the area of one bedroom, then the area of the living room, and finally add the remaining area of the house.

Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, to find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the area of the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, I will calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

Starting with Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

Tuesday: Double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.

Wednesday: Double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.

Thursday: Double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.

Friday: Double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, I will sum the puffs from each day to find the total number of puffs Alice counts over the week:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Adding these together:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Therefore, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, which means the price per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
240
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which means team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:
- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the length of chalk remaining after the teacher used 45% of it on Monday. Then, I will calculate how many days the remaining chalk will last if the teacher uses only 20% of the chalk each day.

1. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk. Therefore, the chalk used is 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches.
3. The chalk remaining after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Now, if the teacher uses only 20% of the chalk each day, the chalk will last longer. We need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last.

4. Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk, which is 20% of the remaining chalk. Let's denote the remaining chalk after day \( n \) as \( C_n \). Initially, \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
5. The chalk remaining after day 1 is \( C_1 = C_0 - 0.2 \times C_0 = 2.75 \times 0.8 \).
6. The chalk remaining after day 2 is \( C_2 = C_1 - 0.2 \times C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.8^2 \).
7. The chalk remaining after day \( n \) is \( C_n = 2.75 \times 0.8^n \).

We need to find the number of days \( n \) such that \( C_n \) is less than 2 inches (the threshold before the chalk needs to be recycled).

8. We set up the inequality \( 2.75 \times 0.8^n < 2 \).
9. Solving for \( n \), we get \( 0.8^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273 \).
10. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get \( n \log(0.8) < \log(0.7273) \).
11. Since \( \log(0.8) \) is negative, we divide both sides by \( \log(0.8) \) and reverse the inequality: \( n > \frac{\log(0.7273)}{\log(0.8)} \).
12. Calculating the values, we get \( n > \frac{-0.134}{-0.0969} \approx 1.38 \).

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, \( n = 2 \).

So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

The number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students} = 17 \text{ students} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike bought 5 face masks.
2. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we can calculate it as follows:

- Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- Johnny bought 2 more than this amount, so he bought \(15 + 2 = 17\) face masks.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 17."
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes.

James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped: 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk sold:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much milk was returned. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he purchased:
\[
\text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the returned milk:
\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600
\]

Therefore, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's age and checking the conditions.

If Colin is 20 years old, then seven years from now he will be 27 years old. According to the first condition:
\[ W = 5(27) = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be 45 years old. According to the second condition:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. 

Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the cost per book as follows:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we can find out how many books each school gets by dividing the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One apple landed on Newton's head, leaving one apple on the ground.
3. Newton picked up the one apple on the ground and put it in his pocket, then threw the apple on his head into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
4. Now there are 5 apples on the ground. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put 4 in his pocket, and threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
5. Now there are 6 apples on the ground. Newton picked up all 6 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 6 apples."
"First, I will calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to fulfill Ali's order of 850 kg of coal.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Next, I will calculate the total cost for 17 bags at $18 per bag.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas are required to satisfy these consumption levels.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies."

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour, and then determine how long it will take for him to have 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

20 snowballs (built) - 2 snowballs (melted) = 18 snowballs

Now, to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs he can make per hour:

60 snowballs / 18 snowballs per hour = 3.3333 hours

To express this in hours and minutes, we take the decimal part (0.3333) and multiply it by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.3333 * 60 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 3 hours and 20 minutes to have 60 snowballs."
"When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, then 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. At that time, Jim was half of John's age, so Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 

Since 20 years have passed, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old. 

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices each ate together: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - At the end of the first day, they had 38 - 38 + 50 = 50 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had 50 - 28 = 22 bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had 22 - 25 + 100 = 77 bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This discrepancy suggests that the bandages they used on the third day might have been more than the 25 bandages they ordered, but the problem does not provide this information directly. Given the information provided, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50."
"To calculate the cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the color cost and the haircut cost.

The color cost is $40.

The haircut cost is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the hair was cut by 2 inches. Therefore, the haircut cost is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding the color cost and the haircut cost together, we get $40 + $60 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost of May's hair cut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional bonus for complete attendance.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the month of April:

1. Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
2. She works 6 days a week.
3. There are 4 weeks in April.

So, the total number of hours she works in April is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay for the month is:
\[ 180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"To calculate the earnings of Jason, I will add up the earnings from each task he completed in the two week period.

1. For doing laundry: $3.00 per week, so in two weeks, Jason earned $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.
2. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per week, so in two weeks, Jason earned $1.50 * 2 = $3.00.
3. For taking the trash out: $0.75 per week, so in two weeks, Jason earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
4. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per week, and he did this 6 times, so in two weeks, Jason earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, I will add up all the earnings:
$6.00 (laundry) + $3.00 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $13.50.

Therefore, Jason earned $13.50 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in a single shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we will add the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is 150 people.

Now, we will sum these numbers:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)}
\]

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the second day was \(1/4\) more than the number he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, \(1/4\) more than 40 is \(40 + (40 \times 1/4) = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted over the two days, we sum the trees planted on each day:

- First day: \(20\) White Oak trees + \(40\) Lodgepole Pine trees = \(60\) trees.
- Second day: \(30\) White Oak trees + \(50\) Lodgepole Pine trees = \(80\) trees.

Adding these together, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(60 + 80 = 140\).

The final numerical answer is 140."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was left after the various incidents.

1. After the children drank 4 gallons, the cooler had:
   24 - 4 = 20 gallons

2. After Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, the cooler had:
   20 - 7 = 13 gallons

3. After Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, the cooler had:
   13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among them. Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is:

8 / 3 = 2.6667 gallons

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
One-third of the fish have red stripes, so:
\[ \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes.
\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
\[ \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Step 4: Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.
\[ \text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. Therefore, Amy loses four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

Therefore, Amy uses up three colors from the makeup set. So, the number of colors left after using up half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height of the first floor. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

This means the height of the first floor is 180 inches. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor (including the ceiling) is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor to the roof of the second floor is 240 inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells remaining.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

This means that after team The finders, there are:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

shells remaining.

The remaining shells were found by team Gogetters. Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ 168 \]

shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information that the average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles.

The total distance walked by all four dogs is the sum of the distances walked by each dog. We know the distances for three of the dogs: 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles. Let's denote the distance walked by the last dog as \( x \) miles.

The total distance walked by all four dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

Since the average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles, the total distance walked by all four dogs is also:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, I will calculate the amount John gets as a loan. His house is worth $250,000 and he gets a loan worth 40% of that.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, I will calculate how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Now, I will calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts. He initially had the loan amount of $100,000, and he used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

"To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72.

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price, so:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 11 \times 9 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, the profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the water removed per day at each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed: \( 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \).

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, we calculate the total capacity of John's classes as:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacities of Ali's and John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:

"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen promised to return.
2. Calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over 11 months from the total amount Stephen promised to return to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen promised to return.
Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest.
Total amount Stephen promised to return = $300 + (2% of $300) = $300 + $6 = $306.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months.
Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months.
Total amount paid over 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275.

Step 3: Calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.
Amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month = Total amount Stephen promised to return - Total amount paid over 11 months = $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $31."

"To solve this problem, let's follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of people on the bus at each stage.

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:** 20 people.
2. **Number of people who entered the bus at the first stop:** 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **Number of people who entered the bus at the second stop:** \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people who entered at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **Number of people who entered the bus at the third stop:** The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people on the bus before doubling: 90 people.
   - Number of people who entered at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[ 270 - 200 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, let's determine the cost of one visit after 5 years. The original cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost has increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate the increase and add it to the original cost:

1. Calculate the increase in cost:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$2 = 1.5 \times 2 = \$3 \]

2. Add the increase to the original cost:
\[ \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

So, after 5 years, the cost of one visit is $5.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:
\[ 5 \text{ visits} \times \$5 \text{ per visit} = \$25 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:
\[ 3 \text{ visits} \times \$5 \text{ per visit} = \$15 \]

Finally, we add the costs from both periods to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

First, we find the total number of students in the school who are eligible to try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each grade and there are three grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 30 students. Since each group consists of 8 students, the number of groups required is:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 3.75 \right\rceil = 4 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each, so the cost for the tables is 4 * $20 = $80. He also manufactured 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the cost for the roof frames is 2 * $10 = $20. Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20 = $100. 

\[

"Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of meat needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret seasoning required based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

Thus, the amount of his secret seasoning Aiden will need is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To calculate the amount of fabric Luke should buy, we first need to determine the total width of all the windows combined.

Each window is 35 inches wide, and there are five windows. Therefore, the total width of the windows is:
\[ 35 \text{ inches/window} \times 5 \text{ windows} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:
\[ 2 \times 175 \text{ inches} = 350 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is 350 inches."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute. Therefore, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of the 36-minute call:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Thus, the total cost of a 36-minute call is \$8.00."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount that fell on Monday. 

First, calculate twice the amount that fell on Monday:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure.
2. Apply the 20% discount for getting both services.
3. Add the cost of nail art on each of her fingers.

First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we calculate the total cost of both services without the discount:
- Total cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Now, we apply the 20% discount:
- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each):
- Cost of nail art per finger: $3
- Total cost for nail art: 10 fingers * $3 per finger = $30

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the total cost after the discount:
- Total cost including nail art: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. The last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since Susan receives 66 issues in total, and each issue is from a different magazine, she gets 66 magazines every year. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 66 \]"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ K = 27 + 4 \]

\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. 

\(\boxed{31}\)"
"To find the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, I will perform the calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:** $40

2. **Price in December:** The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Add this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - So, the price in December is $72.

3. **Price in January:** The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtract this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36
     \]
   - So, the price in January is $36.

The final numerical answer is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for veteran lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
- Standard rate per lesson: $80
- Number of standard rate lessons: 4
- Total earnings from standard rate lessons: \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the 2 lessons with veterans:
- Reduced rate per lesson (25% off the standard rate): \( 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \) dollars
- Number of veteran lessons: 2
- Total earnings from veteran lessons: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
- Total earnings: \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is 440 dollars."

"To solve this problem, I will first determine how many pomelos Eve has left after giving some away, and then calculate how many she gave away.

Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

1/4 of 20 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{novels this year} = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"To calculate the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to determine the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels:

\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is 60%."
"To solve this problem, I will follow the steps as described:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. Therefore, he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. Therefore, the total number of grapes is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final numerical answer is 84."
"To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9

Now, let's perform the calculation:

82 - 13 = 69
69 + 9 = 78

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is 78."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, we add these costs together to find the total weekly cost:
- Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Annual cost = Total weekly cost * Number of weeks in a year
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. However, this result is not practically possible as a percentage of a day cannot exceed 100%. This indicates that the custodian works more than one day to complete the task, which is consistent with the given 5-day timeframe."
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which is \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we can calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:
\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal 60 eggs.

Now, let's determine how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is $1/3.

Total earnings = 60 eggs * ($1/3 per egg) = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings.

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Thus, Rose's profit is $8.00."

   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey got 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass both tests. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of 110 questions:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

Given:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total number of ice cubes equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he actually had 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles he ended up with is 2. 

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

Thus, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of people**: There are 4 people in the house, including Brianna.

2. **Number of flashlights**: There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room. Since there are 8 rooms, there are 2 * 8 = 16 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 (personal) + 16 (room) = 20 flashlights.

3. **Number of candles**: There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

   - For the 4 rooms with small candles: 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.
   - For the 4 rooms with medium candles: 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

   Therefore, the total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

4. **Total number of candles and flashlights**: Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together, we get 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.

Thus, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 56."
"First, I will calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has:

- Mitchell buys two bags of chips.
- Each bag contains 55 chips.

Total number of chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips.

Now, I will divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets:

- There are 5 family members.

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
Number of chips per person = 110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person.

"To calculate the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we first need to determine the total number of hours he works in a week and then convert that into minutes. After that, we can find out how many calls he can handle in that time.

Tim works 6 hours each day, so in a week, he works:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Given that it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call, we can find out how many calls he can handle in a week by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer it will take for the new varnish:
- The difference in drying time is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry as compared to the old varnish."
"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts:

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each, the total water needed is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each, the total water needed is:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups} \]

3. The remaining plants are:
\[ 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \text{ plants} \]
These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so the total water needed for these plants is:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Adding up all the water needed:
\[ 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel half the distance on land and the other half in water.

Half of the distance is 100 yards.

Time to hop 100 yards on land:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Time to swim 100 yards in water:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time to return home:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 15 minutes."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we first need to calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks he needs. The Washington Monument is a large structure, and recreating it with popsicle sticks would require a significant number of sticks. Bob estimates he needs 56 sticks.

Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of sticks by the number of sticks per box:

\[
\frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of these 7 boxes. Each box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"The main phone costs $20. Since the additional phones cost half as much as the main phone, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10. There are four additional phones, so the cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40. Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts made per day by the number of days in June:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"
"To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos uploaded in one day.
2. Determine how many days are needed to upload all 210 photos.

First, we know that Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the number of photos uploaded in one day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes over 5 weeks, I will first calculate the cost for one week and then multiply by 5.

For one week:
- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Total cost for one week: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

For 5 weeks: $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate John's new speaking speed after training, then determine the total number of words in 10 pages, and finally calculate the time it would take him to speak those words at his new speed.

1. John's new speaking speed is 2.5 times his starting speed:
   \[
   150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
   \]

2. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have:
   \[
   10 \times 450 = 4500 \, \text{words}
   \]

3. To find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by his speaking speed:
   \[
   \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{words/minute}} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the number of people Conor saw on the first day:
\[ \text{First day} = 50 \]

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day:
\[ \text{Second day} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day:
\[ \text{Third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day over the week was 60. Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw over the week is:
\[ 5 \times 60 = 300 \]

The total number of people seen over the week can be expressed as the sum of the people seen on each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 300 \]
\[ 260 + 3x = 300 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 300 - 260 \]
\[ 3x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{3} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + \frac{40}{3} + \frac{40}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = 260 + 40 = 300 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the previous rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so 0.5 * 20 = 10 kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of popped kernels:
- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Second 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Third 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 10 kernels

Total popped kernels = 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 = 170 kernels.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. Since 10 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that number is 10 / 4 = 2.5. Since we can't have half a kernel, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 2 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels that pop is 170 + 2 = 172 kernels.

The final numerical answer is 172."
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups}\) of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Tim needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons.
   - Since the other gallons are not twice as tart, they each require 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - The extra gallon will require \(2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups}\) of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - The extra gallon requires 2 cups of lemon juice.

4. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed for all lemonade:**
   - Total lemon juice needed = 4 cups (for the 4 gallons) + 2 cups (for the extra gallon) = 6 cups.

5. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - Each lemon yields 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 6 lemons to get 6 cups of lemon juice.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption of dog food for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds, each consuming 5 kilograms of dog food per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
\[ 3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg/day} \]

The Kennel house also has 2 Bulldogs, each consuming 3 kilograms of dog food per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
\[ 2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg/day} \]

Adding the daily consumption of both breeds gives the total daily consumption of dog food:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \]

To find the total consumption for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by two.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, I will calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: $9000 * 0.30 = $2700
   - Value after first year: $9000 - $2700 = $6300

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at start of second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: $6300 * 0.30 = $1890
   - Value after second year: $6300 - $1890 = $4410

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at start of third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: $4410 * 0.20 = $882
   - Value after third year: $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies: 232
- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: twice the number of red candies
- Yellow candies: half the number of red candies

First, calculate the number of orange candies:
\[
\text{Orange candies} = 2 \times \text{Red candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
\]

Next, calculate the number of yellow candies:
\[
\text{Yellow candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Red candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
\]

Now, sum the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
\text{Red} + \text{Orange} + \text{Yellow} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

Subtract this sum from the total number of candies to find the number of pink candies:
\[
\text{Pink candies} = \text{Total candies} - (\text{Red} + \text{Orange} + \text{Yellow}) = 232 - 189 = 43
\]

Thus, the number of pink candies is:

"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to consider both the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost of one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

Therefore, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip is:
\[ 296 \]"

"First, I will calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
The two children together weigh 75 pounds each, so 2 * 75 = 150 pounds.

The total weight is the sum of these weights:
1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

Therefore, the force needed to push the car is 16 pounds."

"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total amount of feed the pigs consume in a day, and then for a week. Finally, I will subtract this total from the amount of feed Dexter ordered.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day. With five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, which is 7 days, the total feed consumption is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After the pigs have consumed 280 pounds in a week, the amount of feed left is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20 pounds."
"To determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the guests.

John invited 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of hot dogs are required. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

Thus, John needs to spend:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, her total earnings are:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies.

Each tray costs $4:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the trays from her total earnings to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Frances has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. Therefore, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has to distribute.

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals she has to distribute:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To calculate the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin to cents and then sum them up.

1. A quarter is worth 25 cents.
2. A nickel is worth 5 cents. Therefore, two nickels are worth \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.
3. A dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, seven dimes are worth \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, we sum these values:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} + 10 \text{ cents} + 70 \text{ cents} = 105 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount of money James has is 105 cents."

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the time spent each day and then multiply by the number of days in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation in the morning: 15 minutes
- Meditation before sleep: 15 minutes
- Total meditation time per day: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each day:
- Yoga practice: 1 hour (60 minutes)

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga each day:
- Total daily practice time: 30 minutes (meditation) + 60 minutes (yoga) = 90 minutes

Since Charisma practices 5 days a week, we calculate the weekly practice time:
- Weekly practice time: 90 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 450 minutes/week

Finally, we calculate the total practice time over 4 weeks:
- Total practice time over 4 weeks: 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Total practice time over 4 weeks in hours: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To calculate the total square feet of fabric Octavia will use for her quilt, I will add the fabric from all the small, medium, and large t-shirts.

For the small t-shirts:
11 small t-shirts * 3 square feet per small t-shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium t-shirts:
8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet per medium t-shirt = 32 square feet

For the large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet per large t-shirt = 36 square feet

Now, I will add all the square feet together:
33 square feet (from small t-shirts) + 32 square feet (from medium t-shirts) + 36 square feet (from large t-shirts) = 101 square feet

Therefore, the total square feet of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since a dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. Therefore, a large sunflower has 36 * 1.5 = 54 seeds.

Altogether, there are 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds.

\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"If George has 18 pens, then Timothy has three times as many pens as George, which is \( 18 \times 3 = 54 \) pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, which is \( 54 \div 2 = 27 \) pens.

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the height of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"" tall. Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall. Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before summer."
"To calculate the total money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, and the company produces 5000 bars per day. Therefore, the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:

\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars. The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:

\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts and the original prices of the items.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys two T-shirts and the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt is at full price and the second T-shirt is at half price.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount on the shoes.

The discount amount on the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $16.

So, the price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:

\[ \text{Ryan's allowance} = 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so a total of 4 ice cream cones:

\[ \text{Cost of ice cream cones} = 4 \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ \text{Money left} = 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, let's calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \text{Number of movie tickets} = \left\lfloor \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To calculate the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the individual expenses of each of them.

Ellen's expenses:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total for Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's expenses:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so 2 * $100 = $200
Total for Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals together:
Total spent = $105 + $230 = $335

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is $335."
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we first need to determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and finally determine the profit.

For one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 per jar = 10 * $50 = $500

Profit = Revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"To calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, I will first calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8.00
2. Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50
3. Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6.00
4. Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, I will sum these values to find the total dollar amount in the jar.

Total = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To calculate how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, I will first determine how many days he works in a week and then calculate his earnings.

Josh runs his car shop from Monday to Saturday, excluding Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works 5 days a week.

He services 3 cars a day, and he is paid $4 per car. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$12/\text{day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
\[ \$12/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"To solve this problem, I will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of cookies Randy has at each step.

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

3. Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

4. Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 (unchanged)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

5. Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, to find the total number of cookies Randy has now:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 23."
"To calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two halves and calculate the earnings from each half separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
6 toy soldiers * $5/toy = $30

For the second half (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
6 toy soldiers * $7/toy = $42

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
$30 + $42 = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes dug each day and then determine how long it takes to fill in all the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total number of holes dug by the dog is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) holes.

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes each day:
- Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate fills in 9 holes per day.
- The net change in the number of holes per day is \(9 - 6 = 3\) holes filled per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes:
- The net change in the number of holes per day is 3 holes.
- Therefore, it will take \(\frac{84}{3} = 28\) days to fill in all the holes.

Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, 28 days is \(\frac{28}{7} = 4\) weeks.

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, the enrollment at Butler High School is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Now, to find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 6670
Chocolate chip cookies = 1325

The number of chocolate chip cookies made is 1325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. Therefore, Igor gathered:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes} \]

Next, let's determine the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than the number requested. Therefore, Igor gathered:
\[ 14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes} \]

Now, let's denote the number of beakers Igor gathered as \( x \). According to the problem, Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, so \( x = 7 \).

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is given as 29. We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of items:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} = 29 \]

Substituting the value of \( x \) (which is 7) into the equation, we get:
\[ 8 + 16 + 7 = 29 \]

This confirms that the total number of items is indeed 29. Since Igor gathered 7 beakers and placed all of them on the lab bench, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[ 7 - 7 = 0 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount raised by each individual and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how much money Kim raised. Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra:
\[
\text{Kim's money} = 430 + 320 = 750
\]

Next, let's determine how much money Sarah raised. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300:
\[
\text{Maryam's money} = 300 + 400 = 700
\]

Now, we sum the amounts raised by Kim, Alexandra, Maryam, and Sarah:
\[
\text{Total money raised} = 750 + 430 + 700 + 300
\]

Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[
750 + 430 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 700 = 1880
\]
\[
1880 + 300 = 2180

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to run her part of the race.

First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

1. Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
2. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) miles per minute.
3. Let \( d \) be the distance Aaron ran. According to the problem, Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation for Aaron's distance as:
   \[
   d = 16v
   \]

4. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, the distance Vanessa ran is:
   \[
   2d = 2 \times 16v = 32v
   \]

5. We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Thus, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   32v = 4
   \]

6. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

7. Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since her speed is \( \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute, the time \( t \) it took her to run 4 miles is:
   \[
   t = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the new dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required would be:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the earnings of Tom's restaurant in a week, we need to consider the following:

1. The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
2. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
3. They are open 2 days a week.

First, let's calculate the earnings per reservation:
- Cost of 2 meals: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of a bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15

Next, we calculate the earnings per night:
- Earnings per night: 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90

Finally, we calculate the earnings for the week:
- Earnings per week: $90 per night * 2 nights = $180

Therefore, the restaurant makes $180 a week."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we calculate the profit per watermelon and add it to the cost per watermelon:

\[
\text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"To solve this, let's first determine the ages of James and Dora.

James is now twice as old as Dora. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 9 years old. Therefore, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

Now, let's determine the ages of John's sons.

John had a son James when he was 19, so James is 18 years old now. This means John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour, and then find the difference between the number of oranges they peel.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To calculate the total cost Mark paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the radiator.
2. Calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic.
3. Add the discounted price of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic.

First, the cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. So, the discount is 20% of $400.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, the cost of hiring the mechanic is $50 per hour for 3 hours.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the discounted price of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have if they share the pizzas equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices."
