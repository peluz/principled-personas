"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs eaten for breakfast.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking.
4. The remainder will be the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market.
5. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.

Let's go through each step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs left after breakfast is:
   \[
   16 - 3 = 13
   \]
3. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, the number of eggs left after baking is:
   \[
   13 - 4 = 9
   \]
4. The number of eggs sold at the farmers' market is 9.
5. Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
   \[
   9 \times 2 = 18
   \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Adding the bolts of blue and white fiber together, we get:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The problem states that the repairs and subsequent work increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house and add it to the original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase in value means the value increases by:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost Josh incurred from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so the total distance for one sprint in a week is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week for all sprints:**
   Since James runs 3 sprints each week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break down the cost for 16 glasses:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost is:

\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

Thus, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Restart and update installation:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% of the download: 40 minutes
- Time for the restart and update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
- Distance covered in the first segment: 180 miles.
- Distance covered in the third segment: 15 miles.
- Distance covered in the fourth segment: 120 miles.

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- The total cost is \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\)."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.
   - The total distance is 12 miles.
   - The formula for average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for total time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - She spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles.
   - She spent another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles.
   - Total time already spent:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired: 3 hours
   - Time already spent: 2 hours
   - Remaining time:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**

"To determine the amount of water in the remaining mixture, we first need to calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters of mixture. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so the total volume of the mixture becomes \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the 24 liters of the mixture is water. The fraction of water in the mixture is:
\[ \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{24} = \frac{47}{3 \times 24} = \frac{47}{72} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{47}{72} = \frac{24 \times 47}{72} = \frac{47}{3} = 15 \frac{2}{3} \text{ liters} \]

"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns and then use the rate of melting to find the total length lost.

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total length lost:
   - Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, over 4 hours, the total length lost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}
     \]

Thus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

\[
\boxed{8}

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was \( 26 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] (since 17 divided by 8.50 is exactly 2).

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of the shorts:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the shoes:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of:
\[ \boxed{243} \] dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then determine the cost based on the number of cartons she will need to buy.

First, we calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to identify the distances of his stops and the segment in between.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to calculate the distance traveled between his first and second stops. This distance is the difference between the distance of his second stop and the distance of his first stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \). The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the second pair of high heels is twice that, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is therefore \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is 80 jelly beans. 

\[
\boxed{80}

   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per day is \(10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}\).

2. **Determine the time spent per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is \(5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}\).

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many jewels Aaron has:**
   - We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. **Determine how many jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

Thus, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each of the two 20-minute intervals and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both intervals:

\[ 4 \text{ (first 20 minutes)} + 5 \text{ (second 20 minutes)} = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:

\[

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sets of 4 yogurts in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4.
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets of 4 yogurts:**
   Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   \[
   15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games to the money he has left.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that John made $195 from selling his lego sets. To find out how much money he spent, we subtract the money he has left from the total money he made.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 190 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John spent $165 on video games, we can confirm that the remaining $25 is the money he has left.

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he has 0 lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0

"To determine John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine the time he spends running each day. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on the other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin in this condition.

Given:
- Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
- With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

First, we calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips can be consumed while staying within the daily calorie target.

First, let's calculate the total calories available in the 300g bag of chips:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- There are 5 servings in the bag.

Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day:
- The daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

Calories remaining for the day = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
- Each serving has 250 calories.

Number of servings that can be consumed = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 50g (300g / 5 servings), the grams of chips that can be consumed are:
- 0.8 servings * 50g/serving = 40g.

Therefore, the number of grams of chips that can be eaten is 40 grams.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of making 20 candles:**
   - Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles).
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \(40 - 20 = 20\) dollars.

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Determine the total number of Post-it notes she had before and after the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

First, Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after this. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before leaving the store was:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Initially, she had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After purchasing the package, she had 243 Post-it notes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"

2. Calculate the number of occupied units:
\[ \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units:
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \]

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 1764 \, \text{eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Uriah's comic books contribute and then calculate how much weight his toys need to be removed to make up for the remaining 15 pounds.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:
- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
- Uriah removes 30 comic books.

The total weight of the comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much weight the toys need to be removed to make up for the remaining 15 pounds. We know that the total weight of the comic books is 7.5 pounds, so the remaining weight to be removed is:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to make his book bag lighter by 15 pounds.

"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one visit to the movies. 

The cost for one ticket is $7 and the cost for one popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one visit is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one visit:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

Thus, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum additional weight that can be added to the bridge is:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be added, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:
\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:
\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for all the additional fees and the tip he added. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Total**: The initial total for the groceries is $40.00.
2. **Delivery Fee**: The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the initial total.
   - Calculate the 25% fee: \( 25\% \times 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \).
   - Add the delivery fee to the initial total: \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \).
3. **Tip**: Stephen added a $4.00 tip.
   - Add the tip to the total: \( 50.00 + 4.00 = 54.00 \).

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after all the additional fees and the tip, is $54.00.

"To determine the number of good oranges, we need to first understand the distribution of the oranges in the basket.

1. **Total Oranges**: 25
2. **Bad Oranges**: 1
3. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of 25
4. **Sour Oranges**: 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Next, we know the total number of oranges is 25. We can now calculate the number of good oranges by subtracting the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = \text{Total Oranges} - (\text{Bad Oranges} + \text{Unripe Oranges} + \text{Sour Oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) \]
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = 25 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = 17 \]

Thus, the number of good oranges is:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, for the first 20 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - Therefore, the annual pension for the next 10 years is:
     \[
     50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]
   - Over the next 10 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - Adding the pension from the first 20 years and the next 10 years:
     \[
     1,000,000 + 25,000 = 1,025,000 \text{ dollars}

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service is \(\boxed{1025000}\)."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment structure into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year.
   - The reduced monthly charge is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Adding the costs from both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate the total amount of gas in the tank when it is full and then use that to find out how many miles she can drive with the full tank.

Sophia has put in 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank, and the owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Therefore, the full tank contains 12 gallons of gas.

Since she has already traveled 100 miles with the current 4 gallons of gas, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car:
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the full tank:
\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the time Jim spends on TV and reading in one session:
- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
- He reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.
- Therefore, in one session, he spends \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in one week:
- He does this 3 times a week.
- So, in one week, he spends \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours on TV and reading.

Now, we calculate the total time spent over 4 weeks:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level (level 4) as \( S_4 \), the level below it (level 3) as \( S_3 \), the level below that (level 2) as \( S_2 \), and the bottom level (level 1) as \( S_1 \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ S_4 = 16 \]

Since each level below has half the square footage of the level above it:
\[ S_3 = \frac{S_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ S_2 = \frac{S_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ S_1 = \frac{S_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 4 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 8 \)
- Level 4: \( S_4 = 16 \)

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{4} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference in cost is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \). According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15. The final numerical answer is:

2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Therefore, it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum the total number of rings:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**: 
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

6. **Salary Increase for the Third Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8000} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:

\[
\text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:

\[
\text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9
\]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of pets Cindy has.
2. Use this information to find out how many pets Marcia has.
3. Use Marcia's number of pets to find out how many pets Jan has.
4. Sum the number of pets each person has.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as \( C \). So, \( C = 4 \).

Next, we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Let's denote the number of pets Marcia has as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = C + 2 \]
Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ M = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Now, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Let's denote the number of pets Jan has as \( J \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ J = 3M \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ J = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[ J + M + C = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28 \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children using the given information.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( H \)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 years old: \( H = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( H = C - 1 \)

Since we know James's age is 10, we can substitute \( H = 10 \) into the fourth piece of information:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now we know Corey's age is 11. Using the second piece of information, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Using the first piece of information, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
Substituting \( A = 9 \):
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine Lee's original speed:**
   Since Lee runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, his speed is:
   \[
   \text{Lee's speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Determine Gerald's original speed:**
   Since Gerald runs 400 meters in 40 seconds, his original speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's new speed after a 10% improvement:**
   A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald's new speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new speed} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.10 = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's new time with the improved diet:**
   With his new speed of 11 meters/second, Gerald's new time to run 400 meters is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - When the tomatoes are cooked, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The final numerical answer is:

12"

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he baked \( x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, and he now has 110 cookies left. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10. So, the total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16. So, the total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells all ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each sold for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10. So, the total revenue from these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also sells all five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each sold for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16. So, the total revenue from these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Since the total revenue from selling the lumber is equal to the total cost of the lumber, Sasha makes no profit. The profit is:
\[
180 - 180 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total 120 teaspoons corresponds to the 7 parts of sugar.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\). Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120 = 7 \times 6 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

   \[
   2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs of shoes}
   \]
4. **Cost per pair of shoes**: Each pair of shoes costs $60.
5. **Total cost**: 
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid is \( \boxed{360} \)."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially imported is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary is given as $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
   \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[
\boxed{99076.92}

"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week.
2. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper he uses in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets of paper he uses in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sheets of paper he uses in a month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down the problem day by day.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 7 \text{ (Friday)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, determine the remaining time after the first part:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

First, we know that Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters are now stamped and added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

We are also told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since 20 of these are the newly stamped letters, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters that were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

After Julia used 3 spoons, she had \( x - 3 \) spoons left. Her husband then gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x - 3 + 5 = x + 2 \) spoons. According to the problem, after these transactions, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons. Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. **Cost of an orange**: An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying:
- **Total cost for watermelons**: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- **Total cost for peppers**: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- **Total cost for oranges**: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[180 + 300 + 400 = 880\]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\) dollars."
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost associated with each patient visit and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue generated from each patient visit:
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour.

The doctors charge $150 per hour:
- Revenue per patient visit = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost associated with each patient visit:
- The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour.
- Since the patients are seen for \( \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour, the cost per patient visit is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \) dollars.

Now, we can determine the profit per patient visit:
- Profit per patient visit = Revenue per patient visit - Cost per patient visit
- Profit per patient visit = 60 - 80 = -20 dollars.

Since the profit per patient visit is negative, the hospital incurs a loss of $20 per patient visit.

To find the total profit from 500 patients per day:
- Total profit = Profit per patient visit \(\times\) Number of patients per day
- Total profit = -20 \(\times\) 500 = -10000 dollars.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is \(\boxed{-10000}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of elves left, we can follow these steps:

2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 of the remaining elves quit after being kicked. Therefore, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure for June. Given that his expenditure in May was $500 and in June it was $60 less, we can calculate his June expenditure as follows:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = \text{Expenditure in May} - 60 = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Next, we add the expenditures of May and June to find the total expenditure for those two months:

\[ \text{Total expenditure} = \text{Expenditure in May} + \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Pam are \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster are \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Fred are \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

- Total tickets used by Pam and Fred are \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

Thus, the total number of tickets they used that day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"

"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups.

The cost of nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of nonfood items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on nonfood items is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 7 \times 0.10 = 0.70 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of nonfood items including tax is:
\[ 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3

The total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of food items and the cost of nonfood items including tax, we get:

The cost for each client is:
- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each = 2 * $2 = $4
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each = $5

So, the total cost per client is:
\[ $4 + $5 = $9 \]

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

The total expenses for 8 clients are:
\[ 8 \times $9 = $72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. Therefore, the profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = $92 - $72 = $20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, we know that John harvests his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 1000 pineapples per harvest and he has 4 harvests in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then sum them up.

1. The first lego box has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego box has 3 times more pieces than the first one. Therefore, the number of pieces in the second box is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. The third lego box has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one. Therefore, the number of pieces in the third box is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125
   \]

Now, we sum the pieces from all three boxes:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Thus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, she sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave as she saw leave in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before had not already returned. The total number of bees that left before is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees. Since all of these bees return in the last 6 hours, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 90.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference in their times.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
\(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for bicycles + Cost for tricycles + Cost for the unicycle
- Total cost = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. The ants ate one final fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \]
\[ x - 20 = 18 \]
\[ x = 38 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 38 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum these over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To determine the total length of all the baked goods Bill bakes in a day, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls each day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants each day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes each day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods:
- The total length is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12:
- The total length in feet is \(\frac{3360}{12} = 280\) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape over the 2-month period.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by the monkeys in 2 months:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- In 2 months, the monkeys will need \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by the gorillas in 2 months:
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- In 2 months, the gorillas will need \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \).

Then, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by the baboons in 2 months:
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
- In 2 months, the baboons will need \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \).

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in 2 months:
- Total bananas needed = Bananas for monkeys + Bananas for gorillas + Bananas for baboons
- Total bananas needed = \( 400 \text{ bananas} + 800 \text{ bananas} + 200 \text{ bananas} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \).

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

Thus, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

First, let's calculate the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday:
- He walks 20 miles each day.
- There are 5 days from Monday to Friday.

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the total miles he walks on the weekend:
- He walks 10 miles each day on Saturday and Sunday.
- There are 2 days in the weekend.

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday to the miles walked on the weekend:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat**: $25
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon.
   - Therefore, the profit per gallon is \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the donation to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after giving to daughter and wife} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of crabs Monic has.
2. Determine the number of crabs Rani has.
3. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Monic has} = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Next, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
\]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has:
\[
\text{Total number of crabs} = \text{Number of crabs Bo has} + \text{Number of crabs Monic has} + \text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 40 + 36 + 46
\]

Adding these together:
\[
40 + 36 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}

"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To determine Jean's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are four members in the team.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in the total times:
- Difference = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To find out how many apples Jenna and her mother picked together, we start by determining how many apples Jenna picked. According to the problem, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Since her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples they picked together:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of apples they both picked is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags of wheat sold by the trader. Let's denote the number of bags by \( n \).

First, we calculate the total cost incurred by the trader. The cost of buying the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the wheat. The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the number of bags sold is \( 50 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:
- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The total cost of tickets and food is $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, we add the cost of the rides:
- The cost of each ride is $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.
- The total cost for all expenses is $36.00 (tickets and food) + $66.00 (rides) = $102.00.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend paid:
- $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ten ducks.
2. Convert the weekly total into a daily total.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, to find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day, we divide the weekly total by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.**

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees after 10 years.**

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.**

30% of the trees die, so 70% of the trees remain. Therefore, the number of trees left after 10 years is:

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

"First, we need to determine the total amount of grapes produced by Josie's farm per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and she has 10 acres, the total production of grapes is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total production of wine barrels is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year by Josie's farm is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese: \(8 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for all the meals:
\[10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices}\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. Therefore, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens she bought, the total number of pens is:
\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total number of kilometers is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total number of kilometers is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then sum these weights.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. **Tuesday**: She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Tuesday is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Wednesday is:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[
4 + 12 + 60 = 76

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \) dollars.
   - Twenty dozen cups is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     240x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

5. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     240x = 34800
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 240 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

Thus, the cost of each cup is \( \boxed{145} \) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after her initial $10 savings.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total money she earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\) dollars. Adding her initial savings of $10, the total amount of money she will have is \(10 + 4x\).

We need this total to be at least equal to the total cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day, which is given as 100.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day, which is 50 more than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
4. Simplify the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

Given:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the pair of shoes and the matching belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return.
2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.
3. Determine the remaining balance after 12 months.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 0.10 \times 2000 = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 2040 \]

Now, we determine the remaining balance after 12 months. The remaining balance is the total amount promised to be returned minus the total amount paid:
\[ 2200 - 2040 = 160 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Given that there are 4 roses and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, determine their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. Initially, he has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards is the sum of the fire, grass, and water type cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

"To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his burrito and then subtract the value of his gift card.

First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 sauces cost $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

"To determine the total amount Mark pays for the fleet of 12 cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:**
   Each car sells for $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%.
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the cars including tax:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars including tax} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total registration fees:**
   The registration fee is $1,000 per car.
   \[
   \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 pens, he will have 20 pens left (25 - 5 = 20).
3. **Second Mixing**: He can now mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 20 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he will have 15 pens left (20 - 5 = 15).
4. **Third Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 15 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he will have 10 pens left (15 - 5 = 10).
5. **Fourth Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 10 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he will have 5 pens left (10 - 5 = 5).
6. **Fifth Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 5 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he will have 0 pens left (5 - 5 = 0).

At this point, he has used all 25 pens and has made 5 new pens. Therefore, the total number of pens he has is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made.

\[
\text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

5. The remaining students went out through exit C.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of the total number of students.
   \[
   \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. The number of students who went out through exit B is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students.
   \[
   \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students remaining after exit B is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

5. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students:

   \text{Students through exit C} = 280
   \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. We are given that John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2R = 54
\]

To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[
J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We already know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[
54 - 33 = 21
\]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.

Thus, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals. After stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, sending 10 pages back. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages (sent by pen pals)} + 30 \text{ pages (sent back)} = 60 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing in a week, we calculate:

\[ 60 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 360 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his calls with his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for calls with other people.

Therefore, the total number of minutes Jason has used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, after all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2f) \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on her makeup over the course of the movie.

The makeup artist requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. Therefore, the total hours per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours over the 5 weeks is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27000 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate over the two days and then calculate the total calories consumed by each.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we sum up the cookies eaten by Sue and her sister over the two days:
- Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister: \( 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \) cookies.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue: \( 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Calories consumed by Sue's sister: \( 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \) calories.
- Calories consumed by Sue: \( 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:

"Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as \( W \) and the number of cougars killed last night as \( C \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ W = 10 \]
\[ C = 15 \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which we can denote as \( 3C \). Additionally, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which we can denote as \( C - 3 \).

So, today he killed \( 3C \) wolves and \( C - 3 \) cougars. Substituting the values of \( C \):

\[ 3C = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]
\[ C - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed by Rick:

\[ \text{Total animals killed} = \text{Wolves killed last night} + \text{Cougars killed last night} + \text{Wolves killed today} + \text{Cougars killed today} \]
\[ \text{Total animals killed} = 10 + 15 + 45 + 12 \]

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls.

First, we calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys the new cows:
\[ 20 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} + 40 \text{ cows} = 400 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 440 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cows are in each of the 20 stalls after the new cows are distributed. Since the 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows per stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ A_a = 52 \]

From this, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so:

\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:

\[ A_f = A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

And the total number of fruits Jamal has:

\[ J_f = J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ T_f = A_f + J_f = 76 + 92 = 168 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla plans to make 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{62}

\[ 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:
\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget of $400,000.

First, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500 \]

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000 \]

Now, let's find the total price of the house including both the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

Finally, we need to determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   The net proceeds are the selling price minus the total expenses and the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 128,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is \(\boxed{128000}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. The initial heating time to 300 degrees is 20 minutes. The additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the heating time to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the cooking time to get the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time is:
\[ \boxed{51} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these costs.

"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
\[6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}.\]

Next, let's calculate the number of additional windows:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
\[4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}.\]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:
\[12 \text{ windows (from bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}.\]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is:

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the remaining stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.
   \[
   \text{Remaining stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{765}\)."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- Therefore, the total cost for the celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total amount of money used: \(800 + 2400 = 3200\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\)."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines:**
   Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   \[
   54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138

"To find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we need to follow the steps given in the problem and calculate the number of cards with each letter.

1. **Total number of cards**: 80

2. **Cards with the letter A**:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \text{ of 80} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
   \]
   So, 32 cards have the letter A.

3. **Remaining cards after removing the cards with A**:
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48
   \]

4. **Cards with the letter B**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ of 48} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 cards have the letter B.

5. **Remaining cards after removing the cards with B**:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

6. **Cards with the letter C**:
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \text{ of 24} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 cards have the letter C.

7. **Remaining cards after removing the cards with C**:
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9
   \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D, are 9.

Thus, the number of cards that have the letter D on them is:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of hole separately and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time taken to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Time to dig 30 small holes = \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes

Next, we calculate the time taken to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Time to dig 15 large holes = \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes

Now, we sum the time taken for both types of holes:
- Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = \(\frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 4\) hours

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start by defining their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20. This can be expressed as:

\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute 20 for \( M + R \) in the expression:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of spots for both cobras and mambas, and then find half of that total.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for the cobras. There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for the mambas. There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, we calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length used by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the sterling silver beads by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. We can break down the distribution of these stars into rows of 8, 6, and 5 stars.

First, calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's denote the number of rows of 5 stars as \( x \). The total number of stars can be expressed as:
\[ 24 + 12 + 5x = 76 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 36 + 5x = 76 \]

Subtract 36 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 5x = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are sufficient to transport the 80 flagstones. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as \( A \) and the number of medals Izzy has as \( I \). According to the problem, Ali has 22 medals, so \( A = 22 \). Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so \( I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \).

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is \( A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \). The problem states that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out, which means the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 10 \times (A + I) = 10 \times 39 = 390 \).

So, the number of medals given out for counting is \( 390 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{390}

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate of $5 every 10 minutes.

First, let's determine the total time Susan works:
- Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
- She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is \(3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).

Next, we convert the working time into minutes:
- Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2.5 hours = \(2.5 \times 60 = 150 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
- \(150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals}\).

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we calculate her total earnings:
- \(15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the extra point: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the extra point: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}

"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum up the activities for each day:

**First Day Total:**
\[ 100 \text{ (pushups)} + 50 \text{ (squats)} + 20 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 170 \]

**Second Day Total:**
\[ 120 \text{ (pushups)} + 40 \text{ (squats)} + 40 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 200 \]

**Total for Two Days:**
\[ 170 \text{ (first day)} + 200 \text{ (second day)} = 370 \]

The total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats both lunch and dinner, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\). Therefore, the total consumption per day for the household is:
\[ 5 \times 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Let's add these up:

\[
15 + 12 + 18 = 45
\]

So, the total number of crates sold during the week is the sum of the crates sold over the weekend and the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:

\[
20 + 45 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{-55}
\]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

Let's denote the initial bid as \( B_1 = 200 \) dollars. The next bid by Carmen, \( B_2 \), will be \( B_1 + 50 = 250 \) dollars. The next bid by the first of the 3 other people, \( B_3 \), will be \( B_2 + 50 = 300 \) dollars. Carmen's second bid, \( B_4 \), will be \( B_3 + 50 = 350 \) dollars. The next bid by the second of the 3 other people, \( B_5 \), will be \( B_4 + 50 = 400 \) dollars. Carmen's third bid, \( B_6 \), will be \( B_5 + 50 = 450 \) dollars. The next bid by the third of the 3 other people, \( B_7 \), will be \( B_6 + 50 = 500 \) dollars. Carmen's fourth bid, \( B_8 \), will be \( B_7 + 50 = 550 \) dollars.

Carmen wins the auction with her fourth bid, so the total amount she paid is the sum of her bids:
\[ B_2 + B_4 + B_6 + B_8 = 250 + 450 + 550 + 550 = 1800 \]

Thus, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1800}\) dollars."
"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the sum of the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

The combined time for Monday and Sunday is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each side of the fold. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can be used to print 2 pages.
2. Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16."
"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the remaining amount is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books, so the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
3. The number of books sold this year is 45.
4. The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold this year, which is \(2 \times 45 = 90\).
5. The total number of books sold in the first two years is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
6. The total number of books sold in the three years is 200, so the number of books sold in the third year is \(200 - 135 = 65\).

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by $20. Since the number of books sold in the second year is 90, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \(90 \times 20 = 1800\).

The final numerical answer is:
1800"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, we add this bonus to his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \, \text{weeks} \]

Since Watson earns his weekly bonus each week, we consider only the full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the 4 full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he competed against.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he competed against:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
2. Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we have:
\[ \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

Next, we determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:
\[ \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we first need to find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Thus, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week is:

"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the total cost if bought at full price and the total cost if bought at the discounted price, then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at full price and at the discounted price:
- Full price for 2 tubs of ice cream: \(2 \times 13 = 26\) dollars.
- Discounted price for 2 tubs of ice cream: \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: \(26 - 22 = 4\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 4 packets of milk at full price and at the discounted price:
- Full price for 4 packets of milk: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars (assuming the original price of a packet of milk is $5).
- Discounted price for 4 packets of milk: \(4 \times (5 - 0.5) = 4 \times 4.5 = 18\) dollars.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: \(20 - 18 = 2\) dollars.

Finally, the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:
- Total savings: \(4 + 2 = 6\) dollars.

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing the total days by the growth interval for an arm:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing the total days by the growth interval for a leg:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on his trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

We already know he will spend $1950 on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket. So, the amount he can spend on gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the daily consumption and then extend it to a week.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in one day is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."

- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.

So, Jane's age is:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Therefore, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people.

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father.
2. Determine the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store.
3. Calculate the total weight of these marbles.

First, Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]
So, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is the sum of the marbles he bought and the marbles his father gave him:
\[
20 + 8 = 28
\]
Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[
28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg}
\]
Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 30 \).

The number of girls in the classroom is 3 times the number of boys, so the number of girls \( G \) is:
\[ G = 3 \times B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The number of nongendered children \( N \) is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the number of boys, so:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

The total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is \( 123 \)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women left at the party after some people left.

First, let's calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
\[ 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write:
\[ 22 \text{ men} + W \text{ women} = 30 \text{ people} \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Since the problem asks for the number of women left, and we know that 8 women stayed, the number of women left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has and then calculate how many boxes are needed to store all of them, given that each box can hold 10 pencils.

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]
This means Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 26 pencils. Since each box can hold 10 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the capacity of each box:
\[ 26 \div 10 = 2.6 \]
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Jam needs 3 boxes to store all her pencils.

Now, let's consider Meg's pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes Meg needs, we divide the total number of her pencils by the capacity of each box:
\[ 46 \div 10 = 4.6 \]
Again, since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Meg needs 5 boxes to store all her pencils.

Finally, to find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need together, we add the number of boxes needed for Jam and the number of boxes needed for Meg:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

So, the total number of boxes needed is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of cooling and the addition of cream separately, and then combine them.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the milliliters weaker.

Therefore, the total reduction in milliliters due to cooling and adding cream is:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the exchange rate and the outcome of the trades.

Given:
- 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
- 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since each trade of 2 old records results in 1 new record, the number of new records that can be obtained from \( x \) old records is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

We know that the total number of new records obtained is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
x = 7 \times 2
\]
\[
x = 14
\]

Thus, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money the company pays to all its programmers per month. Let's break down the information and calculations step by step.

1. **Determine the number of junior and senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - The salary of junior programmers is given as $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Salary of senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment for all programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. Since the phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge by 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ \text{Time required in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.
3. Calculate the discount from the coupon.
4. Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.**

The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip. Since they spent $43, they used the $4 in rewards. The remaining amount of rewards is:
\[
4 - 4 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount from the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the customer used $4 in rewards, the discount from the coupon is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.**

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. After applying the $4 in rewards, the price becomes:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, applying the $8 discount from the coupon:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before property tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Net income tax rate: 10%
- Net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Finally, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group is then \( x - 10 \). According to the problem, the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, so we have the equation:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

It is also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we have:
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

- The difference is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C costs $2 more than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to consider the number of legs contributed by each type of table and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of legs contributed by the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of legs contributed by the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the 7 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we subtract the cookies that Jenny's son and husband eat from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount.
2. Determine the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost without the discount.

First, the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount. A 40% discount on $60 is:
\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Davos paid \(\boxed{36}\) dollars for the 2 shirts."
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory makes per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractor sales.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silo sales.
3. Determine the increase in daily revenue.
4. Calculate the percentage increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractor sales.**

The factory sold 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was sold for $100.
\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silo sales.**

The factory now sells 5 silos a day, and each silo is sold for $220.
\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

**Step 3: Determine the increase in daily revenue.**

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

The percentage more the factory is making per day now is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first determine her monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of food, treats, and medicine, we get \( 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \) dollars per month.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 months.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is \( 220 \times 12 = 2640 \) dollars.

So, Madeline spends **2640 dollars** on her dog per year."
"To determine the total number of hours Peyton will spend on her after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class on Monday. Therefore, the cooking class lasts \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class on Tuesday. Therefore, the museum tour lasts \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, we sum up the durations of all the activities:
\[ 1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Peyton will spend on her after-work activities is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
2. Calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses.
3. Subtract the number of plant pots already bought from the total number of plant pots needed.

First, we know that April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since she needs twice as many plant pots for the roses, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some of her money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave her brother $4. The total amount of money she spent is $11 + $4 = $15. Therefore, the amount of money she had left after these expenditures is \( 36 - 15 = 21 \).

Since the amount of money she had left after these expenditures is the amount she saved, we have \( S = 21 \).

So, the amount of money Andrea saved is \( 21 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities.

1. **Boating and Swimming:**
   - Boating: 6 hours
   - Swimming: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
   - Total time for boating and swimming: \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) hours

2. **Watching Shows:**
   - He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.
   - Total time for watching shows: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

3. **Total Time Spent on Activities:**
   - Total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows: \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) hours

4. **Total Time Spent:**
   - This 15 hours is 30% of the total time spent.
   - Let \( T \) be the total time spent.
   - Therefore, \( 0.30T = 15 \)
   - Solving for \( T \):
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Sightseeing Time:**

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the height of the shortest tree.
2. Calculate the height of the second tree.
3. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
4. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the height of the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the shortest tree} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the second tree, which is 5 feet more than the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

\[ \$12 \text{ (toy cars)} + \$5 \text{ (teddy bears)} = \$17 \]

Dean started with $28 and spent $17 on toys. So, the amount of money Dean had left after buying the toys is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. Adding this to the $11 he had left:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mini-golf:
- Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf.
- The cost of one round of mini-golf is $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the arcade tokens:
- Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.
- The cost of $5 in arcade tokens is $5.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the go-karts:
- Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice.
- The cost of one ride on the go-karts is $10.
- Therefore, the cost for two rides is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Cost of mini-golf: $5
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5
- Cost of go-karts: $20

Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan's total budget is $90. To find out how much money is left after these expenses, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Remaining budget = $90 - $30 = $60

Since the remaining budget of $60 can be used to buy snacks, drinks, or other party supplies, we need to determine how many friends she can invite. However, the question only specifies the activities and their costs, not the cost per person for additional activities. Assuming the remaining $60 is for additional activities or food for her and her friends, we need to consider the simplest interpretation where the remaining budget is for additional activities.

If we assume that the remaining $60 is for additional activities that can be shared among her and her friends, we can say that she can invite as many friends as she wants with the remaining budget. But since the question asks for the number of friends she can invite, and assuming the remaining budget is for additional activities, the number of friends she can invite is not limited by the remaining budget but by the number of additional activities she can afford.

Given the information provided, the number of friends she can invite is not specified by the remaining budget, but if we consider the simplest interpretation where the remaining budget is for additional activities, she can invite as many friends as she wants.

However, if we strictly follow the numerical interpretation of the question and assume the remaining budget is for additional activities, the number of friends she can invite is not limited by the remaining budget but by the number of additional activities she can afford. Since the question does not specify the cost per person for additional activities, we can conclude that she can invite as many friends as she wants with the remaining budget.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
This answer assumes that the remaining budget is for additional activities and not for the cost per person for additional activities, leading to the conclusion that she can invite 0 friends based on the given information."
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the lollipops.
2. Determine the daily change Marisa saves.
3. Calculate the total savings over 5 days.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of the lollipops:
- Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
- Therefore, the daily cost of the lollipops is \(4 \times 25 = 100\) cents.

Next, let's determine the daily change Marisa saves:
- Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.
- Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, $5 is equal to 500 cents.
- The daily change she saves is \(500 - 100 = 400\) cents.

Finally, let's calculate the total savings over 5 days:
- The daily savings are 400 cents.
- Over 5 days, the total savings are \(400 \times 5 = 2000\) cents.

To convert the total savings from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- \(2000\) cents is equal to \(2000 / 100 = 20\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Billy starts with $10 and spends it on candy. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This means Billy's change after buying the candy is $2. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half of his change is also $2. Therefore, the total amount spent on candy is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. If Billy spent $8 on candy, the amount of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{16}{3}}

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This relationship can be expressed by the equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third cities, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

This fraction represents the number of days between services. To find the number of days, we need to determine how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles. Since the train travels 675 miles per day, the number of days between services is:
\[\frac{18000}{675} = 26.6667 \approx 27 \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. 

Given:
- A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John's trip took, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of his journey separately and then sum these times.

1. **Trip to his friend's house:**
   - Distance: 200 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.8571 hours

2. **Detour:**
   - Additional distance: 10 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.1429 hours

3. **Trip back home:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we sum the times for all segments:
\[ 2.8571 \text{ hours} + 0.1429 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5.0000 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip took:

"Let's denote the number of girls in the park as \( G \) and the number of boys as \( B \).

According to the problem, there are 6 girls, so \( G = 6 \).

It is also stated that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls, so \( B = 2G \).

Substituting the value of \( G \) into the equation for \( B \), we get:
\[ B = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

The total number of kids in the park is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys:
\[ \text{Total kids} = G + B = 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points Jane needs to reach a total of at least 42 points. We set up the following inequality:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]
where \( x \) represents the points Jane needs to score on her third test.

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we sum up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
\[ C + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the current point totals and then work backwards.

1. Sara's current points are given as 8.
2. Erin's current points are three times Sara's points. Therefore, Erin's current points are \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
3. Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. So, before scoring the 14 points, Erin had \(24 - 14 = 10\) points.

Thus, the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**

"To determine the total cost of making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means the DIY option saves $80. Therefore, the total cost of making his own wallpaper is the original cost minus the savings:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

4. **Returns:**
   Six pairs of shoes were returned because they didn't fit.

5. **Total Pairs Sold:**
   We sum the pairs sold each day and subtract the returns.

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, we calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can find the number of faulty pieces by calculating 40% of the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment by \( N \). The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces of equipment is then \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

Next, we need to find the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment. Since the total cost of all pieces of equipment is $400,000, the cost of each piece of equipment is \( \frac{400000}{N} \). Therefore, the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \(\boxed{240000}\)."

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since the loan period is five months, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for five months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.1667\%
   \]
   The total interest for five months on a $3,650 loan is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times \frac{4.1667}{100} = 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 150 = 3800
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months. Therefore, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760
   \]

Thus, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26. On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the performance is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio. Let the number of popsicles Betty has be \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has be \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% savings:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.
- With a 20% savings, the total savings is 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- Therefore, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the savings is $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

Next, we add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
- The total cost of the streaming services is $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) + $10 (Netflix) = $26 a month.

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package:

   She spends half the time recording that she spent writing. Therefore, the time spent recording is:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Time spent editing the song:**
   Carol spends 90 minutes editing. Converting 90 minutes to hours:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total time spent on all activities:**
   Adding up all the time spent:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Percentage of time spent editing:**
   To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{7.5} = \frac{1.5 \div 1.5}{7.5 \div 1.5} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

Next, we calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of days the builder works in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we calculate the builder's annual earnings by multiplying the number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
- The builder gets paid $50 every day.

So, the annual earnings are:
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14400 \]"
"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- Total flour needed: 12 cups
- Number of 2-cup bags required: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- Total milk needed: 4 cups
- Number of 2-cup bottles required: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- Difference: \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

Thus, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine the energy savings, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original and reduced usage conditions.

1. **Original Usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
   - It is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy consumption is:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 216 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, so the new usage is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
     \]
   - The daily energy consumption under reduced usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - Converting to kilowatt-hours:
     \[
     2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy consumption is:
     \[
     2.7 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Energy Savings:**
   - The energy saved over 30 days is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
     \[
     216 \text{ kWh} - 81 \text{ kWh} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Thus, the number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is \(\boxed{135}\)."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we sum up the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are a total of 4 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\frac{88}{4} = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[22\]"
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat required = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese required = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the initial number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: The number of corns is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis. Since the number of cannolis is now 100, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. This is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{Number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps from School and Home**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he has taken:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Additional Steps**: He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Adding these to the steps from school and home:
   \[
   5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Remaining Steps**: After his short walk, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps he took before his jog is:
   \[
   10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps During Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had already taken from the total steps he needed to reach his goal:
   \[
   8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time Toby will take to read the book and then subtract the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to read the book} + \text{Time to get to the airport} = 30 + 10 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Thus, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:
\[ \text{Minutes early} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in June:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with the following pricing: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she pays $3/2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost. So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Therefore, the total amount Tim spends is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make to last her for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies are needed based on the recipe.

First, we know that Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Therefore, for 30 days, the total number of cookies she will need is:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we know that the recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens of cookies are needed to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and that 100% of these dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are not dangerous, meaning 1% of the candles are dangerous.

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \]

Next, we know that 100% of the dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Therefore, the number of dangerous candles that also smell like wet dog is:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 100\% \text{ of } 500 = 500 \]

Since the problem asks for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, and we have established that all dangerous candles smell like wet dog, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog, which is 500.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 500 \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees, and doesn't gather any from the average trees. Therefore, her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees and \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees as \( S_{\text{avg}} \). The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + S_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Substituting the known values for \( A_{\text{tall}} \) and \( A_{\text{short}} \):
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + S_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} + S_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, \( S_{\text{avg}} = 0 \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350. \]

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Let's denote the number of camels by \( c \) and the number of dromedaries by \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[
124 + d = 180
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
d = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The fifth day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the fifth day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **The sixth day:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers.
   - Distance traveled on the sixth day: \( 300 \text{ km} \).

5. **The seventh day:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers.
   - Distance traveled on the seventh day: \( 300 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled over the two-week period:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1640 \text{ km}

"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet (where Stanley was standing) minus the 4,000 feet it fell, which means the comb is at 6,000 feet.

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

The difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb is:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the total amount received from the banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add this total to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50.
2. Four boats each carry away 5 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. Subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining cats run after a mouse. The number of cats that run away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).
5. Subtract the number of cats that ran away from the remaining cats: \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service under the given conditions, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24

"Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

Substituting the value of \( T \):
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \] dollars.

The total cost of both jeans is:
\[ T + J = 28 + 22 = 50 \] dollars.

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Then:
\[ S = 6 \] dollars.

The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}S = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \] dollars.

The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ S - \frac{1}{3}S = 6 - 2 = 4 \] dollars.

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in the original cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \] dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. This means she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
2. Each of the store-bought bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day.
3. Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.
4. The store-bought bird feeders attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds per day.
5. The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds per day.
6. Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and the homemade feeders, which is 60 + 90 = 150 birds per day.

The final numerical answer is 150."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the soup**: 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we calculate:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the cake**: Half of the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( N \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}N \) cards at $1.5 each, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money earned} = \frac{2}{3}N \times 1.5 = N \]

Kenny uses this money to buy a ticket to the amusement park and also has $50 in spending cash. The cost of the ticket is $100, so the total amount of money he needs is $150. Therefore, we have:
\[ N = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with \( N = 150 \) cards.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hot dogs the caterer prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hot dogs prepared for the initial 36 guests. According to the problem, half of the guests would eat two hotdogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would eat 2 hotdogs each. Therefore, the number of hot dogs prepared is:
\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to account for the 40 guests who showed up. Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, we need 40 more hot dogs to satisfy everyone's second hotdog request. However, only 36 hot dogs were prepared. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name and then find the total number of letters in both names.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together gives:

\[6 + 11 + 2 = 19\]

So, the total cost of the items is $19. Next, we need to find out how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[2 + 16 = 18\]

So, Dora currently has $18. To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[19 - 18 = 1\]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]

2. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of gas in each container.
2. Calculate how much gas Josey needs in terms of the total amount of gas.
3. Convert the amount of gas Josey needs from gallons to pints.

**Step 1: Determine the amount of gas in each container.**

There are 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers. So, the amount of gas in each container is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much gas Josey needs in terms of the total amount of gas.**

Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Since each container is 3 gallons, the amount of gas Josey needs is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Convert the amount of gas Josey needs from gallons to pints.**

There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, the amount of gas Josey needs in pints is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} \text{ pints} = \frac{24}{4} \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then use that information to find out how many candy bars he bought.

First, let's denote the amount of money George initially had as \( M \). According to the problem, George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means that the $5 he spent is 99% of his initial money. We can express this relationship as:
\[ 0.99M = 5 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = \frac{5}{0.99} = \frac{500}{99} \approx 5.0505 \]

Next, we know that George spent $5 on chips and candy bars. Let's denote the number of candy bars he bought as \( x \). The cost of the chips is $0.40 per bag and the cost of each candy bar is $0.75. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]
The total cost of the chips and candy bars is $5, so the cost of the candy bars is:
\[ 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 \]
The cost of the candy bars can also be expressed as:
\[ 0.75x = 3.80 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]
Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we recognize that \( \frac{76}{15} = 5 \) (as the exact division gives 5 with a remainder that fits the context of the problem).

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to calculate the weight of each piece and then subtract the weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom have eaten.

1. The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces.
2. Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs \( \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) ounces.
3. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have \( 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \) ounces.
4. The remaining weight of the cake is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) ounces.

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To determine how many oranges everyone will get, we first need to find the total number of oranges and then divide that total by the total number of people sharing the oranges.

Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Thus, everyone will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then compare it to Wayne's travel time.

First, we know that it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than that to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Thus, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

However, since Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne, we need to consider the absolute time difference:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]
This means Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Therefore, the total temperature increase from baking is \(3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Temperature After Baking**:
   - The new temperature after baking is \(40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window**:
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Therefore, the total cooling effect from the window is \(\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

5. **Final Temperature**:
   - The final temperature after the window is opened is \(55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}\).

Thus, the house's final temperature is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times are:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time James takes to complete the triathlon is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting up the equation for James's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hour} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Bails of hay} = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 - 24 = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses that can be made is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays that can be filled is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score is 214 points. After scoring 26 points, his new score is:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score is 225 points. After scoring 10 points, her new score is:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sales and then subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale:
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.
- Revenue from the flash sale = \( 17 \times 20 = 340 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store:
- The total number of sneakers is 48.
- Number of sneakers sold to the department store = \( 48 - 17 = 31 \).

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the department store:
- The department store bought each sneaker for $25.
- Revenue from the department store = \( 31 \times 25 = 775 \) dollars.

Next, we sum the revenues from both sales to find the total revenue:
- Total revenue = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
- Total revenue = \( 340 + 775 = 1115 \) dollars.

The cost of the sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Cost
- Profit = \( 1115 - 576 = 539 \) dollars.

Thus, the salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the two different types of packets separately and then sum them up.

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. Therefore, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and one soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket. This means the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 17 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 17 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

1. **Determine the initial cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon initially was:
     \[
     \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new cost per balloon:**
   - Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - Calculate \(170 \times 65\):
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both segments:
\[120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna trades away. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies she receives. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of Jenna's jewels after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires, and after trading 3, she has:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

The value of her remaining sapphires is:

"To determine the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples eaten by Marin in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples eaten by Nancy in 30 days.
3. Add the two quantities together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for his raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions:
- Width: 2 feet
- Length: 8 feet
- Height: 2 feet

The volume of one raised bed is:
\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of green and yellow cards, and then sum all the cards.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - Calculate 60% of 15:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Add this to the number of red cards to find the number of green cards:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24
     \]
   - So, there are 24 green cards.

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Calculate the sum of red and green cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]
   - So, there are 39 yellow cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78
     \]

Thus, the total number of cards is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 25 fairies. So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there.
3. Therefore, the total number of fairies after the 25 fairies joined is \(50 + 25 = 75\).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \(75 - 30 = 45\).

Thus, the final number of fairies remaining is 45.

\[
\boxed{45}

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies that have spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk over the three weeks.
2. Divide the total number of minutes needed to break in the shoes by the total number of days he will walk.

First, we know that three weeks is equal to 21 days (since 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the shoes. He plans to walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Now, we divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days he will walk:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429 \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's denote the total number of kids in Gina's class as \( N = 32 \).

Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy, and \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts. We are given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy),
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts),
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts).

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:

\[
\text{Total amount of money given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid.

First, we know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The human pyramid is structured as follows:
- 4 girls on the bottom layer
- 3 girls on the second layer
- 2 girls on the third layer
- 1 girl on the top layer

The total height of the pyramid will be the sum of the heights of all the girls in the pyramid. Since there are 10 cheerleaders, we can calculate the total height as follows:

\[ \text{Total height} = 9 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Total height} = 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per person is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. This means setting the two expressions for the total cost equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the width of the chair as \( C \), the width of the rug as \( R \), and the length of the couch as \( L \).

Given:
- The chair is 3 feet wide, so \( C = 3 \) feet.
- The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so \( R = C + 5 \).
- The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so \( L = 2R + 2 \).

First, we calculate the width of the rug:
\[ R = C + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the length of the couch:
\[ L = 2R + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \) dollars. Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \) dollars.

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2. Let's denote the cost of the green apple gum as \( G \) dollars. According to the problem, she paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, so \( G = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total amount Suzie spent is the sum of the cost of the strawberry gum and the grape gum and the green apple gum. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost \( 2 \) dollars. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies.
2. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]
3. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies that Josh made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has.
2. Determine how much money Ali gives to his sister.
3. Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister.
4. Determine how much money Ali uses to buy dinner.
5. Calculate the remaining amount of money after buying dinner.

Let's start with step 1. Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount of money he has is:
\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, in step 2, Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

In step 3, the remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

In step 4, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. So, the amount used to buy dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

In step 5, the remaining amount of money after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes Royce to shingle the house. According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Time for Royce} = 2 \times \text{Time for Rob} + 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Substituting the time Rob takes into the equation:

\[ \text{Time for Royce} = 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time for Royce} = 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time for Royce} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 280 \]"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren. Then, we multiply the number of each item by the number of skeins required for that item.

- Hats: 3 hats × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters × 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs × 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs × 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up all the skeins needed:

6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"To determine how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday.
3. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday.
4. Determine the number of problems Chris completes on Wednesday.
5. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.

First, we know that Chris completes 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
So, the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]
This means the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is:
\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]
On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems:
\[ \frac{52}{4} = 13 \]
So, the number of problems remaining after Wednesday is:

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then sum these amounts.

1. **Tony's rate:**
   Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

2. **Bobby's rate:**
   Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby's rate is:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

3. **Kathy's rate:**
   Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy's rate is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

4. **Ricky's rate:**
   Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky's rate is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

Now, we sum the rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:
\[
6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy is:
\[
\boxed{29}

"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the number of rows for the blue tulips separately, and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of rows of red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \).

Finally, we sum the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to get the total number of rows:
- Total rows = rows of red tulips + rows of blue tulips = 6 + 3 = 9.

Thus, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first figure out how much raisins she will have for each of the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix) after dividing the bag of raisins equally.

The total amount of raisins is 27 cups. Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the three items, each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup of raisins. Therefore, the number of batches she can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \(12 \times 1.50 = 18\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity after adding the new device:
- The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(12 + 2 = 14\) kilowatts per hour.
- The daily cost is \(14 \times 1.50 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly cost before adding the new device is \(18 \times 7 = 126\) dollars.
- The weekly cost after adding the new device is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:
- The difference is \(147 - 126 = 21\) dollars.

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints the house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is one-fourth of a house. Therefore, the rate of one person is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a house per day.

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate of painting the house would be \(5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\) of a house per day. This means that 5 people can paint the whole house (which is 1 house) in \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day.

To convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day into hours, we note that there are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day is equal to \(\frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2\) hours.

So, the number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 19.2 hours."
"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \) and the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has \( S_O + C_O = 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has \( S_J + C_J = 64 + 66 = 130 \).
- The total number of sofas and chairs is \( 42 + 130 = 172 \).

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

With $4, Tom could have bought:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, let's establish the pattern:
- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, we calculate the total hours for each period:
- For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together gives the total number of hours:
\[24 + 10 + 6 = 40\]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, i.e., \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 63 = 122 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Jame's age in 8 years will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) years.
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - Since Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, his current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22 years.
   - Jame's cousin's current age is 47 years.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( B \) be the number of boys.
- \( G \) be the number of girls.
- \( S_b \) be the number of seashells each boy brought.
- \( S_g \) be the number of seashells each girl brought.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are 20 kids in total, so \( B + G = 20 \).
2. The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each, so \( S_b = 60 \).
3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, so \( S_g = S_b + 4 \times S_b = 5 \times S_b \).

Since \( S_b = 60 \), we can calculate \( S_g \) as follows:
\[ S_g = 5 \times 60 = 300. \]

Thus, each girl brought 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

1. Determine how many candies George originally had.
2. Calculate how many candies Nick originally had based on the information that Nick had twice as many candies as George.
3. Since George ate 5 candies, we need to adjust the number of candies George has to reflect this.

First, we know that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 candies left. Therefore, before eating the candies, George had:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ candies} \]

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had as:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ candies} \]

So, the number of candies Nick has is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"Let's denote the initial share of each boy as \( x \). Since the total amount is $18 and it is shared among 3 boys, we have:

\[ 3x = 18 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, each boy initially gets $6. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his new share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

The following day, he adds another $10 to his share:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

After spending $8, his remaining amount is:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

He then triples the amount he has left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings for the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly target is $1125, so we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save \( x = 25 \) dollars per day in the first half of April. For the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final numerical answer is $7.00."

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. If she finishes 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Distance for one round trip:**
   - Jeff walks to his work and back home each day.
   - The distance to his work is 3 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is \(3 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Number of round trips per week:**
   - Jeff works 5 times a week.
   - Each day he makes 1 round trip.
   - Therefore, in 5 days, he makes \(5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ round trips}\).

3. **Total distance walked in a week:**
   - Each round trip is 6 miles.
   - Over 5 round trips, the total distance is \(5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ miles}\).

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting:**
   Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting:**
   Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting:**
   Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and half of the alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything she has already written means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight loss over the 3 months and then add this to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

His final weight is 70 pounds. Therefore, his initial weight was:
\[ 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

The initial weight of Mark was \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of toys needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
2. Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's play set.
3. Use the information that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to find out how many toys he currently has.

First, calculate the number of toys needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Next, let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{398} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. **Cost of notebooks:**
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

2. **Cost of pens:**
   - Each pen costs $0.25.
   - Daniel wants to buy 2 pens.
   - Total cost for pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

3. **Cost of the calculator:**
   - The calculator costs $12.
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 calculator.
   - Total cost for the calculator = $12.

4. **Cost of the geometry set:**
   - The geometry set costs $10.
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 geometry set.
   - Total cost for the geometry set = $10.

Now, we sum up the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20.

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
- 10% of $20 = 0.10 * $20 = $2.
- Total cost after discount = $20 - $2 = $18.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate: 30%
   - Amount: $1000
   - Commission earned: \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \)

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Commission rate: 40% (30% + 10% additional)
   - Amount over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
   - Commission earned: \( 1500 \times 0.40 = 600 \)

3. **Total commission earned:**
   - Total commission: \( 300 + 600 = 900 \)

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $900 from her sales. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water, and then calculate the difference in time for swimming 3 miles in each condition.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water. Since it takes 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time for warm water as follows:

\[ \text{Time in warm water} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. For cold water:

\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:

\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and swimming 3 miles in cold water:

\[ \text{Difference} = 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The final numerical answer is:

2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is \(3 \times 40 = 120\) dollars.
3. Adding the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub gives us the total cost: \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag. We know that there are 21 buttons in total, out of which 7 buttons have two holes each, and the remaining buttons have four holes each.

First, we calculate the number of buttons that have four holes:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with two holes:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with four holes:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Finally, we add the two quantities together to get the total number of holes in all the buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Timothy's locker size**: We are given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
   
2. **Zack's locker size**: Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we calculate Zack's locker size as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Peter's locker size**: Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we calculate Peter's locker size as follows:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Peter's locker is \(3\) cubic inches."
"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]"

- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information given:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Now, we can calculate the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is the sum of their weights divided by the number of people, which is 3.

The sum of their weights is \(150 + 130 + 260 = 540\) pounds.

The average weight is \(\frac{540}{3} = 180\) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(10 \times 5 = 50\) degrees upward from the pyramid.

3. **Final Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
   - After moving 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground will be \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ S = 44 \]

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ S + 7 = 44 + 7 = 51 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be:
\[ N + 7 \]

The relationship given in the problem can be written as:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by each:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made \(\boxed{21}\) more dollars than Liam."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday through Wednesday and the number of plastic action figures he will buy from Thursday through Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that after these 4 days, Peter has:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining $50. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of wooden action figures and the number of plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures:
\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up all the individual costs:

"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they need to make 10 sandwiches, they will use 1 loaf of bread, which costs $3.00.
- The cost of different cheeses and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

"To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet, and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times (12 \text{ dollars/square foot} + 2 \text{ dollars/square foot}) = 216 \times 14 = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

The first step is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30. \]

The next step is to divide this result by 5:
\[ \frac{30}{5} = 6. \]

The final step is to multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
\[ 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48. \]

Thus, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."
"To find out how many cards the boy and his brother have together, we first need to determine how many cards the brother has.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven's temperature setting and then apply this percentage to the 520 degrees required by her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature. Now, we need to find the temperature that, when set on the oven, will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( T \) be the temperature that Maggie should set on the oven. The actual temperature will be:
\[ T \times (1 + 0.04) = 520 \]
\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ T = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 500 \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of the movies together.

First, convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

Next, convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, add the durations of the two movies:
- Total duration = 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house and the combined value of both houses, we start by calculating the price of Juan's house. We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, which was purchased for $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, we subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount:**
   - The original price of one box is $100.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is \(100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00\).
   - The discounted price per box is \(100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00\).
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is \(90.00 \times 2 = 180.00\).

2. **Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes:**
   - Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
   - Therefore, 2 boxes contain \(90 \times 2 = 180\) single use contacts.
   - Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the total number of pairs is \(180 \div 2 = 90\).

3. **Calculate the cost per pair of contacts:**
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00.
   - The total number of pairs is 90.
   - The cost per pair is \(180.00 \div 90 = 2.00\).

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her exercise session.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. We can set up a proportion to find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:

\[
\text{Water needed} = \left(\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}}\right) \times 1600 \text{ calories}
\]

Simplifying the proportion:

\[
\text{Water needed} = \left(\frac{100}{200}\right) \times 1600 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times 1600 = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans.
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans.
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

We can express these conditions mathematically as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

Finally, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
\[
8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay than on Amazon. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can express the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^{n-1} \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:

- On day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^{1-1} = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- On day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^{2-1} = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- On day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^{3-1} = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- On day 4: \( h(4) = 4 \times 2^{4-1} = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

We see that on day 4, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet. Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on day 4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - The cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total protein intake per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the total number of legs from all the pets:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times \$0.50 = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times \$0.60 = \$12 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires of Jeremy's car undergo in a month and then calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.

First, we calculate the number of rotations the tires make in one mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rotations the tires make in 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations in 400 miles} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can calculate the number of months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Determine the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash into cents.

First, we know that the bottle of shampoo gives 120 washes with 2 pumps. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then the bottle will give her 120 washes. The cost of the bottle is $24.00.

Next, we calculate the cost per wash:
\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\text{Total cost of the bottle}}{\text{Total number of washes}} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
\]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert $0.20 to cents:
\[
0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:

\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:

\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is also a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shorts is:

\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:

\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:

\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street individually.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$29100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$94660 \]

Next, we find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \$94660 - \$29100 = \$65560 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65560}\) more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding and the additional funding.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.

2. **Additional Funding:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means the total research period is:
   \[
   5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]
   The first 5 months are already covered by the initial funding. The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) require additional funding.

   Each month after the first 5 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial $100,000. Therefore, the additional funding per month is:
   \[
   100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   The total additional funding for the remaining 45 months is:
   \[
   45 \text{ months} \times 150,000 \text{ dollars/month} = 6,750,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   Adding the initial funding and the additional funding gives:
   \[
   100,000 \text{ dollars} + 6,750,000 \text{ dollars} = 6,850,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{6850000}

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each an ounce in size, and there were 8 beef tips. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the number of days in March and then multiply by the average number of posts per day per member.

March typically has 31 days. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Therefore, the total number of posts per day for all members is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.**

Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
\[ \text{Total loads of laundry in a year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of water used in a year.**

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
\[ \text{Total gallons of water used in a year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.**

A gallon of water costs $0.15.
\[ \text{Total cost of water used in a year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell the total amount of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull is:

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is given by the number of rows multiplied by the number of seats per row:
   \[
   4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
   \[
   54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, we calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights at all 4 intersections. Since there are 24 street lights at each intersection and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Finally, we need to account for the 20 street lights that are not working. The number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

Thus, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert the speed to Mb per second as follows:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"To determine how many years Adam needs to grow to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert his current height from inches to feet. Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will need 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much James made from his commission, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold.
2. Determine the total amount the company paid to acquire these 10 cars.
3. Calculate the total profit from selling the 10 cars.
4. Compute James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 10 cars.**

Each car costs $25,000, and James sold 10 cars.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount the company paid to acquire the 10 cars.**

The company paid 30% of the total cost to acquire the cars.
\[
\text{Amount paid by the company} = 0.30 \times 250,000 = 75,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit from selling the 10 cars.**

The total profit is the total revenue from selling the cars minus the amount paid by the company.
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]
\[
\text{Total profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Compute James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{James's commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp he purchased and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as \( t \) hours.

In \( t \) hours, Bob will have traveled \( 55t \) miles.
In \( t \) hours, Tom will have traveled \( 70t \) miles.

Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead, the distance Tom travels in \( t \) hours must be 75 miles more than the distance Bob travels in \( t \) hours. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 70t = 55t + 75 \]

Now, we solve for \( t \):
\[ 70t - 55t = 75 \]
\[ 15t = 75 \]
\[ t = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ t = 5 \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Thus, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is at most $10.

The cost per class is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{C}{n} \]

We need to find the maximum \( n \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can find out how many miles Lynn ran by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each additional feature and then add it to the base price of the truck.

1. **Base price of the truck:** $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade:** $7,500
3. **Leather seats:** One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards:** $500 less than the cost of the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package:** $1500

Now, we sum up all the additional costs:
\[
\text{Total additional cost} = 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 13500
\]

Finally, we add the total additional cost to the base price of the truck:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30000 + 13500 = 43500
\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is \(\boxed{43500}\) dollars."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the promotion, we need to consider both the raise and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- The raise amount is \( 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \).

So, Tim's new monthly salary after the raise is:
- \( 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \).

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \).

So, Tim's total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- \( 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \).

Finally, to find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
- \( 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tim will make in a year is $372,000."

   \[
   \text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
   \]

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   The cost of each dress pant is \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the cost of a suit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each dress pant} = \frac{750}{5} = 150
   \]
   James buys 10 dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
   \]

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.

   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Summing up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the average daily publications from each website and then multiply by the number of days in February.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Similarly, for 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

To find the total number of articles published by both websites together in February, we add the two totals:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

Thus, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to find the total time taken to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:

1. Determine the number of likes after three weeks.
2. Calculate the total number of likes after adding the recent likes.

First, we know that after one week, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. The initial number of likes was 2000, so:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, Fishio received 140,000 likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, we add these to the 140,000 likes:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800. 

The total amount she made in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the total sales from the first and second months:

\[ \text{Total two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time James hired the carriage:**
   - James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - This is a total of 4 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours).

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Therefore, the paid hours are 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second paid hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
   - The cost for the third paid hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - First paid hour: $15
   - Second paid hour: $30
   - Third paid hour: $60
   - Total cost: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Thus, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{105}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves Lori will need in total. Since each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, the total number of deviled egg halves required is:
\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of deviled egg halves into whole eggs. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs required is:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, we first need to calculate how many pages she has already written. Since she has written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

\[
\text{Pages written} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
\]

Next, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages to find out how many pages she still needs to write:

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The cooking time for beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) \).

First, we calculate \( P \):
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ \text{Total time} = R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and each goose has one head, we have:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

2. The total number of animal legs is 70. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so we have:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[ s + g = 20 \]
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We can solve this system step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have:
\[ s + g = 20 \]
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( s \) is 15. To find the number of geese \( g \), we substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's coffee and donuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee per pound:**
   The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   \[
   \text{Increase in cost} = 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of more expensive coffee per pound} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of coffee needed for a week:**
   Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Since he needs coffee for a week (7 days), he will need:
   \[
   1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week:**
   The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
   \[
   7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the donuts:**
   Roger buys 1 donut per day for a week. Since each donut costs $2, the total cost for 7 donuts is:
   \[
   7 \text{ donuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/donut} = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of everything:**
   Adding the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donuts:
   \[
   42 \text{ dollars} + 14 \text{ dollars} = 56 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of everything is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie. 

Gus bought:
- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each, which totals $2.00 * 2 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00 \]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total amount spent on the other items from the total amount spent:
\[ 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198.

The number of newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = \text{Total newspapers} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C}) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours John attends.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the given rate.

First, let's calculate the total number of class hours. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks. Therefore, the total number of class hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, the number of recipes he learns is:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of history teachers.
2. Determine the number of math teachers.
3. Calculate the total sleeping time for the math teachers.

First, we calculate the number of history teachers. Since 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we have:
\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90. \]

Next, we find the number of math teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60. \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}. \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they shared equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120. Therefore, Kassidy has:
\[
Kassidy = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna has:
\[
Rayna = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together:
\[
Total = Rayna + Kassidy + Aurelia = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share this total amount equally, each person would have:
\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"First, we need to determine the number of management employees in the company. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Given that only 30% of the management employees oversee the entire company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.3 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 candies of type A. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining six days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The next three days are: Good, Neutral, Good

Adding these to the existing counts:
- Good days: \(12 + 2 = 14\)
- Bad days: \(8\) (unchanged)
- Neutral days: \(10 + 1 = 11\) (one additional neutral day)

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \( J \) with 21:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height between the target height and the current height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(4 + 8 = 12\).

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs one toy per dog.
   - He needs 12 toys to accommodate the 12 dogs.
   - After buying the toys, he has 12 toys.

3. **Second Purchase:**
   - James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs means \(2 \times 12 = 24\) more dogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(12 + 24 = 36\).
   - James needs 36 toys to accommodate the 36 dogs.
   - After buying the toys, he has 36 toys.

4. **Third Purchase:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(36 - 3 = 33\).
   - James needs 33 toys to accommodate the 33 dogs.
   - After buying the toys, he has 33 toys.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is 33.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{33}

"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to follow the sequence of investments step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. **Skyler's Investment:**
   Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

Thus, Skyler's investment was \(\boxed{240}\)."

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load capacity of the elevator:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20} \text{ kg} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as \( M \), the number of cookies Katarina has as \( K \), the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \), and the number of cookies Summer has as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \).
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \).
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \).
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \).

First, we can substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the second equation:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, we can find the number of cookies Summer has using the third equation:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- The Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the times into minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken for each half is:
- Time for the first half in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes
- Time for the second half in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

Now, we sum the times for both halves:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we first need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking.

1. They spend 6 minutes walking to the corner where the library is.
2. They then spend another 13 minutes walking to the fire station.

Adding these times together:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

They have a total of 30 minutes to get to school. To find out how much longer they have, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of the twins as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), and the ages of the triplets as \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Without loss of generality, let's assume \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \) or \( T_2 = P_1 + 7 \). We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \) or \( T_2 = P_1 + 7 \), we can substitute \( T_1 \) or \( T_2 \) with \( P_1 + 7 \). Let's assume \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \). Then the equation becomes:

\[ (P_1 + 7) + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 2P_1 + T_2 + P_2 + P_3 + 7 = 44 \]

\[ 2P_1 + T_2 + P_2 + P_3 = 37 \]

Since \( T_2 \) and \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) are the ages of the other twin and the other two triplets, and without loss of generality, let's assume \( T_2 = P_2 + 7 \) (the same logic applies if we assume \( T_2 = P_3 + 7 \)). Then the equation becomes:

\[ 2P_1 + (P_2 + 7) + P_2 + P_3 = 37 \]

\[ 2P_1 + 2P_2 + P_3 + 7 = 37 \]

\[ 2P_1 + 2P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]

Since \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) are ages of triplets, they must be positive integers. Let's assume \( P_1 = 5 \), \( P_2 = 5 \), and \( P_3 = 5 \) (since they are triplets and the equation must hold). Then:

\[ 2(5) + 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 10 + 5 = 25 \]

This does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 4 \), and \( P_3 = 9 \):

\[ 2(4) + 2(4) + 9 = 8 + 8 + 9 = 25 \]

This also does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 5 \), and \( P_3 = 8 \):

\[ 2(4) + 2(5) + 8 = 8 + 10 + 8 = 26 \]

This does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 6 \), and \( P_3 = 7 \):

\[ 2(4) + 2(6) + 7 = 8 + 12 + 7 = 27 \]

This does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 7 \), and \( P_3 = 6 \):

\[ 2(4) + 2(7) + 6 = 8 + 14 + 6 = 28 \]

This does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 8 \), and \( P_3 = 5 \):

\[ 2(4) + 2(8) + 5 = 8 + 16 + 5 = 29 \]

This does not satisfy the equation. Let's try \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 9 \), and \( P_3 = 4 \):

\[ 2(4) + 2(9) + 4 = 8 + 18 + 4 = 30 \]

This satisfies the equation. Therefore, \( P_1 = 4 \), \( P_2 = 9 \), and \( P_3 = 4 \). Then \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \) and \( T_2 = P_2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \).

So, one of the twins is 11 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework. The time required for each subject is as follows:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time John needs to complete his homework from the total time he has before dinner:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Let's denote the cost of one candy as \( c \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 + 4 \times c = 3.20 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 2.00 + 4c = 3.20 \]

Subtract 2.00 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 1.20 \]

Now, solve for \( c \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ c = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years.
4. Sum the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.

**Step 1: Number of coins Rong saves per month.**
Rong saves 20 coins per month.

**Step 2: Number of coins Neil saves per month.**
Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[
20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
\]

**Step 3: Total number of coins saved by Rong in ten years.**
There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]
Thus, the total number of coins Rong saves in ten years is:
\[
20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

**Step 4: Total number of coins saved by Neil in ten years.**
Similarly, the total number of coins Neil saves in ten years is:
\[
28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

**Step 5: Total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in ten years.**
Adding the total coins saved by Rong and Neil:
\[
2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}
\]

Thus, the total number of coins they have ten years after they started their savings is:
\[
\boxed{5760}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total bill first and then determine how much John leaves with after paying.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - Therefore, the heartworm check cost = 0.60 * \( T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( T \):
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate the amount John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - Total bill is $100.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[
\text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana:
\[
\text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[
5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[
12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[
7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each color of square on the comforter.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
\text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To determine the total points collected by the class and how many more points are needed to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points, we need to calculate the points collected by each student and then sum them up.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

To find out how many more points are needed to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points, we subtract the total points collected from 400:

"To determine how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to find the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat runs at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( v \) feet per second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can write the relationship as:
\[ 15 = 5v \]

To find \( v \), we solve for \( v \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ v = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet per second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance \( d \) the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds is given by:
\[ d = v \times \text{time} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that they raise an equal amount in every hour.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The fixed cost for going picking is $20.
- The cost per pound is $1.5, and James picked 30 pounds.
- Therefore, the cost for the blueberries is \( 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5/\text{pound} = \$45 \).

Adding the fixed cost and the cost for the blueberries:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
- James picked 30 pounds.
- Therefore, the cost at the store is \( 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5/\text{pound} = \$75 \).

Now, we find the difference between the cost of buying at the store and the cost of picking the blueberries:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

Thus, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store."
"To determine the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new prices, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price of each computer.
2. Multiply the new price by the number of computers.

First, let's find the new price of each computer. The original planned price for each computer was $700, and the price increased by 10%. Therefore, the new price is:
\[ 700 + 0.10 \times 700 = 700 \times 1.10 = 770 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different conditions under which she dances.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- When her arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- Therefore, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are at her sides is \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
- Over 5 minutes, the total number of taps when her arms are at her sides is \(550 \times 5 = 2750\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute.
- Therefore, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
- Over 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes out of the 5 minutes), the total number of taps when her arms are raised is \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) taps.

Now, we add the two totals together to get the combined total number of taps:
\[2750 + 1200 = 3950\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{3950}\)."

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

"To determine the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to calculate the total number of spools of thread Candy has. We do this by summing up all the spools:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} = 150 \text{ spools}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools, which includes both light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
\]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now, calculate the percentage:

\[
\left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of blue spools of thread is:

\[
\boxed{40\%}

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this relationship as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
Substituting the father's age:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, candidate B received:
\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 0.50 \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total number of votes cast is 100. The votes received by candidate C are the remaining votes after accounting for the votes received by candidates A and B. Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each person has is updated as follows:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(2 + 3 = 5\).
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(5 \times 3 = 15\).
4. Mara ate 2 slices. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(15 - 2 = 13\).
5. Her friend stole 5 slices. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(13 - 5 = 8\).

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. We can do this by summing the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses:

\[
8 \text{ (dogs)} + 5 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (birds)} + 12 \text{ (horses)} = 28 \text{ (total animals)}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7:

\[
\frac{28 \text{ (total animals)}}{7 \text{ (days)}} = 4 \text{ (animals per day)}
\]

Thus, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To determine the savings, we first need to calculate the total cost for Jake's family at each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the total cost at the first amusement park and the total cost at the second amusement park:
\[76 - 48 = 28\]

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."

   - Weekly savings: $50/day * 7 days/week = $350

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Sean has:**
   Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has}
   \]
   Rearranging to find the number of marbles Cal has:
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question as stated is not feasible in terms of equal group sizes.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups (as initially stated), we can proceed with that interpretation.

To find out how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups:
- Initial number of groups = 6
- Required number of groups = 12

The number of additional groups needed:
\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the weekly rental for weekdays and weekends:
- Weekdays: 5 days a week, 60 chairs rented each day.
  \[
  5 \text{ days/week} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 300 \text{ chairs/week}
  \]
- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 200 \text{ chairs/week}
  \]

Next, we add the weekday and weekend rental numbers to get the total weekly rental:
\[
300 \text{ chairs/week} + 200 \text{ chairs/week} = 500 \text{ chairs/week}
\]

Now, we calculate the total rental for one 4-week month:
\[
500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2000 \text{ chairs}
\]

Since we are considering two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one 4-week month by 2:
\[
2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}
\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know that the total monthly cost for electricity is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate pays each month:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent out.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we account for the number of glasses and plates that were broken and returned. Jeff received 10 broken glasses and 6 broken plates.

The number of glasses Jeff has now is:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]

The number of plates Jeff has now is:
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 128 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of stickers and buttons Lorraine has at each step of the trading process.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \).
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \).

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \).
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27.
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20.
   - Total large buttons: \( 27 + 20 = 47 \).

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has 47 large buttons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{47} \]"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to sum the matches he played on each day of the week.

1. Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. Joey played 1 match on Friday.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \). According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house will need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[
x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs \( x = 100 \) cases of shingles. Therefore, the number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:

"To determine how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \implies \$5 \text{ additional earnings} \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.

"To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem carefully.

1. **Initial number of pencils:**
   Anthony started with 50 pencils.

2. **Pencils given to Brandon:**
   Anthony gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon.
   \[
   \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25
   \]

3. **Pencils given to Charlie:**
   Anthony then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   \[
   \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]
   After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, we calculate the time Jack spends driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent driving is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how many wheels Henry will have left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for both the cars and the motorcycles, and then subtract this from the total number of wheels he has.

First, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.

\[
\text{Total wheels for cars} = 4 \times 57 = 228
\]

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.

\[
\text{Total wheels for motorcycles} = 2 \times 73 = 146
\]

Now, we add the total wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:

\[
\text{Total wheels required} = 228 + 146 = 374
\]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we subtract the total wheels required from the total wheels he has:

\[
\text{Wheels left} = 650 - 374 = 276
\]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:

\[
\boxed{276}
\]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. A 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means we subtract 20% of $1000 from the original price.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price you have to pay:

\[ \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies that are in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
\]

This means the number of movies that are not in series is:

\[
600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[
0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies}
\]

The remaining movies that are not older are:

\[
400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the series movies. Since a third of the movies are in series and he can get them for $6 each, the total cost for the series movies is:

\[
200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the older movies. Since 160 of the remaining 400 movies are older and each costs $5, the total cost for the older movies is:

\[
160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the 240 normal movies. Since each normal movie costs $10, the total cost for the normal movies is:

\[
240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding up all these costs, the total cost to replace the movie collection is:

\[
1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4400}
\]"
"To calculate how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by its respective price per pound and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by both driving and hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance driven. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance driven is given by:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the distance hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is:
\[ \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
The distance hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance to the vacation spot is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can express these relationships as:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points for each level are calculated as follows:
- Points for jumping on enemies: 10 points per enemy
- Points for collecting berries: 5 points per berry
- Points for finishing the level: 30 points per second left on the timer

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she loses 30 points for each second she is slower. Therefore, the points Ava earns are:
\[ 10E_A + 5B_A + 30 \times 4 \]
Substituting \( E_A = E_E + 8 \) and \( B_A = B_E + 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + 120 \]
\[ = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + 120 \]
\[ = 10E_E + 5B_E + 215 \]

Emma's score, without the penalty for finishing 4 seconds slower, would be:
\[ 10E_E + 5B_E \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E_E + 5B_E + 215) - (10E_E + 5B_E) \]
\[ = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. The total cost of these two pizzas is:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:

\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel consumed based on the car's fuel efficiency.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.**

Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

For 5 days, the total distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel consumed.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel consumed for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters:
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
  \[
  140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the twenties she spent:
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties, so the number of twenties she spent is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ twenties}
  \]
- Therefore, the total value of the twenties she spent is:
  \[
  6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch:
\[
35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[
\boxed{155}

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[
\boxed{142}

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

"To determine how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to calculate the temperature drop during the night and then figure out how many logs are required to raise the temperature back to 32 degrees.

1. **Calculate the night temperature:**
   - Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
   - Nighttime temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

2. **Determine the temperature drop:**
   - The temperature drop from the day to the night is 45 degrees - 12 degrees = 33 degrees.

3. **Calculate the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
   - Number of logs needed = Temperature drop / Temperature increase per log = 33 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 6.6 logs.

Since Carson cannot burn a fraction of a log, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 7 logs to ensure the temperature does not fall below 32 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing 90 by 9:

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked 11 hours in total. Since her regular workday is 8 hours, she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Now, we calculate the payment for her regular hours and her additional hours separately.

For the 8 regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

For the 3 additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the payments for the regular hours and the additional hours to find the total payment for the day:

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discounted price of the jeans is:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with, which is $50.00:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.
3. Multiply the monthly total salary by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all 260 employees in one month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the monthly total salary by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total duration of singing both ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice.
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Deck the Halls""} = 2 \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once.
- Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Jingle Bells""} = 1 \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:

\[

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's calculate Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initially, Billy's hourly wage is $10.
- After 2 months, his wage increases by $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.
- On his first anniversary, his wage increases by another $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Next, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours for both Billy and Sally:
- Billy's total earnings for 20 hours at $11.50 per hour is $11.50 \times 20 = $230.
- Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Her total earnings for 20 hours at $10.50 per hour is $10.50 \times 20 = $210.

Now, we find the difference in their earnings:
- The difference in earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

Thus, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[
\boxed{428}
\]"
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of students in the school:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

Now, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Finally, let's find the total number of trees planted by adding the trees planted by the students and the trees planted by the teachers:
- The total number of trees planted is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Thus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is \(\boxed{1240}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the video game achievement, we need to calculate the total number of hours she has already played and then subtract that from the required 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, the total number of hours she played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kris played in the following week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, the total number of hours she played in the following week is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the following week to find the total number of hours she has played so far:
\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal, we subtract the total hours she has already played from 30:
\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation distance} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the number of miles that will separate the two cars is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine the total amount James paid, we need to calculate the cost of the ring including the premium.

First, we find the total cost of the ring without the premium:
- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300
- Total cost without premium: $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we calculate the premium:
- Premium: 30% of $900
- Premium amount: 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost without premium to find the total amount James paid:
- Total amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1170}
\]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: \( 340 \)
- Fourth graders: \( 40 \)
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

Now, we sum the total number of students who passed:

\[ 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \]

The total number of students tested is:

\[ 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \]

The overall pass rate is then:

\[ \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 70\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can create with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on its height and the area it can cover.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the total area in square inches is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the area formula for a rectangle (length times height):
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add this to the remaining tea.

First, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 4 students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, we add the tea consumed by both groups to find the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Order and Sales**: Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 of them. Since he can't sell more than he has, he would have sold out of his initial order and would need to order more to meet the demand.

2. **Additional Order**: Dale then ordered 100 more candies. This brings his total number of candies to 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies.

3. **Total Sales**: Dale has sold 150 candies.

4. **Remaining Sales Needed**: To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell to have all 200 candies sold, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has:
   \[
   200 - 150 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10

2. **Number of students at the end of each month**:
   - **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
   - **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
   - **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
   - **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
   - **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

3. **Total number of students by the end of May**:
   - Total students = 320

4. **Number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year**:
   - 10 students

5. **Additional students who joined by the end of May**:
   - Additional students = Total students by the end of May - Initial number of students
   - Additional students = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310.

\[
\boxed{310}

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked and then subtract the petals of the flowers she dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each group of flowers she picked:

1. **First group:**
   - Number of flowers: 3
   - Petals per flower: 5
   - Total petals: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

2. **Second group:**
   - Number of flowers: 4
   - Petals per flower: 6
   - Total petals: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

3. **Third group:**
   - Number of flowers: 5
   - Petals per flower: 4
   - Total petals: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)

4. **Fourth group:**
   - Number of flowers: 6
   - Petals per flower: 7
   - Total petals: \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

Next, we sum the total number of petals from all groups:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each group, so we need to subtract the petals of these dropped flowers:
- From the first group: \(1 \times 5 = 5\)
- From the second group: \(1 \times 6 = 6\)
- From the third group: \(1 \times 4 = 4\)
- From the fourth group: \(1 \times 7 = 7\)

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of dropped petals from the initial total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they use 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows and they dropped 3 on the ground, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total playtime and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the playtime for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total playtime for all four friends:
\[ 20 + 10 + 30 + 10 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows 20 minutes of play, we need to determine how many quarters are required for 240 minutes of play:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = 2C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( \frac{S}{2} \) in the equation \( F = C \), giving us \( F = \frac{S}{2} \).

Now, we can express all quantities in terms of \( S \):
- \( S = S \)
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( F = \frac{S}{2} \)
- \( C = \frac{S}{2} \)
- \( G = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of all these quantities:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + S \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + S = 6S \]

Since the total mixture fills a 10-ounce jar, we have:
\[ 6S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( 2S \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

Thus, the amount of oil used is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Thus, the total amount of money John spent is:

\[
\boxed{4500}

Paul already has:
- 8 chocolate cupcakes
- 40 toffee cupcakes

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. Therefore, the number of additional cupcakes he needs to buy is:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final numerical answer is:
\[16\]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Sum the time walked on both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we sum the time walked on both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert 12 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate how many cars left the parking lot during the lunch break.
3. Find out how many cars remained in the parking lot after the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left the parking lot is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, the daily earnings are:
   \[

"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contains 11 tins, the total number of tins of cat food is:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contains 6 tins, the total number of tins of dog food is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

The total number of eggs is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we'll find the difference between these two amounts.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find out how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund amount from the shipping cost:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the negative value indicates a loss, the amount of money Milly will lose is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has before making any purchases. She starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has initially is:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she buys. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. The cost of the two pairs of jeans is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Adding the cost of the bag, the total cost of the items she buys is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money she has:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and calculate the time spent on each.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - Over four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equals \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Over four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Over four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent:
- Time on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time on makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
1128"
"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost Calculation:**
   - The base cost for the installation is $129.00.
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base cost already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 0 more shelves, 0 more chandeliers, and 10 more pictures.

2. **Additional Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 0 more shelves, 0 more chandeliers, and 10 more pictures.
   - The cost for the additional items is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost for additional mirrors} = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for additional pictures} = 10 \times 15 = 150
     \]
   - Total additional cost:
     \[
     30 + 150 = 180
     \]

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Adding the base cost and the additional cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 129 + 180 = 309
     \]

Thus, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{309}\)."
"To determine how much money Roy has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Eva's Savings:**
   Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Anthony's Savings:**
   Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   \[
   \text{Anthony's Savings} = \text{Eva's Savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
   \]

3. **Roy's Savings:**
   Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
   First, calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of Anthony's Savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
   \]
   Then, add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
   \[
   \text{Roy's Savings} = \text{Anthony's Savings} + 12.00 = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
   \]

Thus, Roy has saved \(\boxed{42.00}\) dollars."
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei, starting from Pompei's capacity.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers during each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first 4 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the next 6 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we sum the distances from both segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speeds, and the time it takes for them to complete the journey.

First, let's establish the total distance of the highway. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Number of kangaroos} \times \text{Speed of each kangaroo} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \times \text{Speed} \times 18 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 54 \times \text{Speed} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is:
\[ \text{Speed of each turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of each kangaroo}}{2} \]

The time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Number of turtles} \times \text{Speed of each turtle}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54 \times \text{Speed}}{4 \times \frac{\text{Speed}}{2}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54 \times \text{Speed}}{4 \times \frac{\text{Speed}}{2}} = \frac{54 \times \text{Speed}}{2 \times \text{Speed}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the number of hours it will take for four turtles to travel the same distance is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by identifying the number of dishes each person made based on the information provided.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   Kora made 20 clay dishes.

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Therefore, we calculate Rory's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, we calculate Jada's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Dishes:**
   To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we sum the dishes each person made:
   \[
   \text{Total dishes} = \text{Jada's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Kora's dishes} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
   \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = \text{total money} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total money she has is $50 less than the final price of the laptop:
\[ \text{total money} = 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together, the total number of slices Adam gets from the apples is:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue left in all three glue sticks:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \). According to the problem, Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2S \) socks.
Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{D}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so if Jack has \( S \) socks, he has \( 2S \) dishes. Since we know Jack has 60 dishes, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S = 60 \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ S = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]
So, Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 30 socks and 30 dishes.

Now, we calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[ \text{Total socks} = S + 2S = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = D + \frac{D}{2} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only) + \( B \) (students good at both math and English).
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only) + \( B \) (students good at both math and English).
- The total number of students is 20.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both:
\[ M + E - B = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ (5 + B) + (8 + B) - B = 20 \]
\[ 5 + 8 + B = 20 \]
\[ 13 + B = 20 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, the number of students good at both math and English is 7. Now, we can find the total number of students good at math:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on and off stage, and the intermission.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, there is a 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total time required for one group including the intermission is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Thus, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The annual interest rate \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) percent per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ I = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 675 \]
\[ I = 202500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 202500 \]
\[ A = 202800 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{202800} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. We know that half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so the other half do not have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
\[
50 - 20 = 30
\]

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. This is simply the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:
\[
30 - 20 = 10

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75
\]"
"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Sum the remaining goats from both farms.

First, we know that Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. The number of goats sold from Farm Y is twice the number sold from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

Next, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:
- Farm X initially had 55 goats and sold 10 goats, so the remaining goats in Farm X are \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- Farm Y initially had 45 goats and sold 20 goats, so the remaining goats in Farm Y are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we sum the remaining goats from both farms:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 110 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get $2 off for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we need to clean one-half of them, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
   \[
   \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the number of hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum these amounts.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. In the third year, the town builds twice the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the equation for the mom's age:
\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8. \]

Now we substitute \( Y \), \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13. \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than 54, Mr. Jackson will have 56 - 54 = 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day:**
   On the second day, the amount of water again doubles. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is:
\[
\boxed{22000}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people from the previous day.

**Day 0 (initial):**
- Number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Rafaela and Julieta received as tips, we start by calculating the amount Rafaela received.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, with each customer giving her a $20 tip. Therefore, the total amount of money Rafaela received is:
\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received altogether:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Rafaela and Julieta received as tips altogether is:
\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. She also gave her only boy 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\). 

Subtracting the oranges given away from the initial amount, we find that Jennifer remained with \(12 - 9 = 3\) oranges.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges Claire earns in a year. Since Claire earns 1 badge every month, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Amber to earn a badge. According to the problem, it takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire takes 1 month to earn a badge, Amber takes:
\[ 2 \text{ months} \]
to earn a badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we know that Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges, so the difference is:
\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.
4. Compute the total revenue from selling the banana bread slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking.**

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**

Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.**

Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Compute the total revenue from selling the banana bread slices.**

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she had 70 gold coins, we can express the number of gold coins as \( G = S + 30 \). Given that \( G = 70 \), we can substitute and solve for \( S \):

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. The total number of coins she has is the sum of the gold coins and the silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed.
3. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, we calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students. There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos:
\[ 50 \times 10 = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed. Mr. George ate 20 burritos:
\[ 500 - 20 = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered. George ordered 600 burritos:
\[ 600 - 480 = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The number of red cars is 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so it is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so it is \(10 \times 3 = 30\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Adding these together gives:
\[ 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

To find \( A \), we subtract 37 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books that Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, we need to determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds and the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per box.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
\[
30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box of jello makes 10 small jello cups.
\[
\frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per box.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25.
\[
12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and per bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00.

First, we calculate the cost per bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we determine the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has.

First, we calculate the total cost of the bolts:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bolts} \times \text{Cost per bolt} = 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
\]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost} = 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
\]

So, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the profit Sarah will make from selling the rope. The profit is the total cost paid by her friend minus the cost of the rope to Sarah.

\[
\text{Profit} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ meters} \times 1 \text{ dollar/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use this $20 profit to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the profit by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[
\text{Meters of new rope} = \frac{20 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{20}{1.5} = \frac{200}{15} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \text{ meters}
\]

Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 13 meters of the new rope. The cost for 13 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost of 13 meters} = 13 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 19.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from her profit.

\[
\text{Money left over} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 19.5 \text{ dollars} = 0.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0.5}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age first. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken:
- Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- Since a pack of bacon costs $10, a pack of chicken costs \(2 \times 10 = $20\).
- Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is \(6 \times 20 = $120\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries:
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for the strawberries is \(3 \times 4 = $12\).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
- Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs \(\frac{4}{2} = $2\).
- Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is \(7 \times 2 = $14\).

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Cost of bacon: $10
- Cost of chicken: $120
- Cost of strawberries: $12
- Cost of apples: $14

The total cost is \(10 + 120 + 12 + 14 = $156\).

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 65 - 156 = -91 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the cost of all the items. She is short by $91.

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \(\boxed{-91}\)."
"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is given by:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

Initially, Argo has 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

First, we calculate the total number of toys given away:
\[ 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys left.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to calculate how many microphones were left without a pair.

Given that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, we can calculate the number of microphones that won't be paired as follows:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"

"To determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

Total petals for orchids = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid
Total petals for orchids = 5 × 5 = 25 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each African daisy has 10 petals.

Total petals for African daisies = Number of African daisies × Petals per African daisy
Total petals for African daisies = 4 × 10 = 40 petals

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the African daisies and the orchids:
Difference in petals = Total petals for African daisies - Total petals for orchids
Difference in petals = 40 - 25 = 15 petals

Therefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final numerical answer is:

2. Determine the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants.
3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.
4. Determine the number of flowering plants.
5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of indoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Number of outdoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of flowering plants:**
   \[
   \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Percentage of flowering plants:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is \(\boxed{25\%}\)."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we first need to find the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to first establish the cost of the yogurt and then calculate the total cost of the other items she consumes.

1. **Cost of the Salad:**
   The salad costs $6.

2. **Cost of the Yogurt:**
   The yogurt is half the price of the salad. Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost of the Salad and Yogurt:**
   Adding the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
   \[
   6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of All Goods:**
   Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods.

5. **Cost of the Carrots:**
   Subtract the total cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost of all goods to find the cost of the carrots:

   \]

Thus, Ellen pays \(\boxed{1}\) dollar for one carrot every day."
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours per week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first calculate how much she earned from mowing lawns.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's lawn. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn. Therefore, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is the sum of the times she mowed each lawn:
\[ x + 3x + 5x = 9x \]

We know that Tasha earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Since the problem does not specify the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, we assume that the $6 is the total earnings from mowing Joe's lawn, which means she mowed Joe's lawn once. Therefore, \( x = 1 \).

Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the total number of mowings:
\[ 9x = 9 \times 1 = 9 \]

So, Tasha mowed lawns 9 times in total. Since she earned $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and assuming the earnings from mowing each lawn are the same (as no other information is given), she earned $6 from each lawn mowed. Therefore, her total earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Tasha's total earnings for the month were $80. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 74 \]"
"To determine John's profit, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting his car and then subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month:
\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

So, John's profit on his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]
Solving for \( M \), we get:
\[ M = 7 - 5 = 2 \]
So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Consequently, Joseph had \( 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \) notebooks.

After buying 5 more notebooks, Martha now has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we start by determining the distance Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the distance Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance rowed on that day:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}
\]"

   Susan initially made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies.
   \[
   100 - 4 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews:**
   We need to divide the 96 cookies by 6.
   \[
   \frac{96}{6} = 16 \text{ cookies per nephew}
   \]

Thus, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel was not able to read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages read by each:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\)
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\)

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. This leaves 3 adult's bowls of soup. Calvin's wife is also an adult, so she will eat one bowl of soup, leaving 2 adult's bowls of soup. The two children will each eat one bowl of soup, leaving 0 adult's bowls of soup.

So, the total number of bowls of soup initially in the pot is:
\[ 4 \text{ (adult's bowls)} + 8 \text{ (child's bowls)} = 12 \text{ bowls} \]

After Calvin and his wife have eaten, there are 2 adult's bowls left. Since each child can have one bowl of soup, the 2 remaining adult's bowls can be shared between the two children. Therefore, each child can have one bowl of soup.

Thus, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then add these amounts together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50. William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( 52 = 2(A - 4) \).

We need to solve for \( A \) first:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday.
3. Calculate his earnings based on the number of packages completed.

First, we know that Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, the number of packages he completes per hour is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:
\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since Colby is paid $0.20 for every package he completes, his total earnings for the day are:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Let's denote the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons as \( 3Y \). According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 2 \times 20 + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

To find \( Y \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( Y = 6 \).

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is \(12 \times 0.25 = 3\) dollars.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[11 + 3 + 14 = 28\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[28 \div 2 = 14\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing each sport and then sum them up.

1. **Tennis Players**: There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. **Volleyball Players**: There are twice the number of tennis players, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. **Soccer Players**: There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of soccer players is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, we sum the number of students playing each sport:
\[ 6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine the profit the class made from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all students.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all students.**

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.
\[
\text{Total number of lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
\[
\text{Profit} = \$240 - \$150 = \$90
\]

Thus, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

The total number of pets is:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day.
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh can eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat together in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, each row has \( 2x \) cups of tea.

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of tea in the rows is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

This means:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

So, in each row, there are \( x = 2 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( x = 2 \) cups of mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. We need to find out how many such trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of water in the tank.
2. Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, given the rate of emptying.

First, we know that the pool contains 10000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, the amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water emptied in 6 days is:
\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:
\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total cost of the items he has already bought:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\] dollars

Colby's total budget for the month is $150. Subtracting the amount he has already spent from his total budget gives the remaining amount he can spend:
\[150 - 120 = 30\] dollars

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Since each movie ticket costs $10, he can see:
\[30 \div 10 = 3\] movies

Therefore, the number of additional movies Colby can see is:
\[

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to first determine the calories for the mini versions of the cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins, and then sum them up.

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.

2. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

3. **Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories from mini cinnamon rolls is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

4. **Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories from mini blueberry muffins is \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

5. **Total calories from all pastries:**
   - The total calories from mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins is \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So, the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
62 (total toys now) - 48 (toys before buying bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean by \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Q + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Q = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Q + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:
\[
Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[

"First, let's determine the initial number of water balloons each person had:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so each friend received \(2\) balloons.
- Maria herself received \(1\) water balloon.

So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding Maria's balloon:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons.

So, the total number of additional balloons given by her mom is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling the widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost under the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for each type of animal.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Therefore, for 15 goats, the total amount of hay required is:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of hay required for each sheep. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
Thus, each sheep needs:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
For 12 sheep, the total amount of hay required is:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts of hay required for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the cost of gas, which is $50. So, after spending $50 on gas, his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract this amount from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for 5 pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour to ensure the full hour is covered. Thus, the labor cost for 2.25 hours is $35 * 2 = $70.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, we sum these components:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost}

   \text{Total cost after discount} = 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of the CDs James decided to keep:**
   James decides to keep 5 CDs, and each CD costs $15.
   \[
   \text{Cost of CDs kept} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the CDs he decided to sell:**
   James sells 5 CDs for $40.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling CDs} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the net loss by subtracting the revenue from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Net loss} = \text{Total cost after discount} - \text{Revenue from selling CDs} = 90 - 40 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money James was out is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we sum up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time for initial swim} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time for remaining swim} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for initial swim} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time for remaining swim}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by determining seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. Since Sam had 70 loaves, seven times this amount is:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

The bakery has 40 less than this amount. Therefore, the number of loaves of bread the bakery has is:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"To determine the final number of stickers Jasmine has, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary arithmetic operations step by step.

1. Jasmine starts with 15 stickers.
2. She loses 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15:
   \[
   15 - 7 = 8
   \]
3. Then, her teacher gives her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to the 8 stickers she has left:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13.

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Number of copies: 6
- Cost per copy: $5

The commission from the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Number of copies: 10
- Cost per copy: $15

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, substitute Deanna's age into the second equation:
\[ M = 26 - 5 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now, substitute \( M = 21 \) into the first equation:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To solve for \( L \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 21 \times 2 = L \]
\[ L = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we isolate \( A \) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Then, we solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in one inch:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \text{ pages} \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he worked and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours = 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes = 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
- Total reports = 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time she was not sleeping on her bed that day is the time she was sleepwalking plus the time she woke up early:
\[ 23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time she slept on her bed is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 452 \]"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of measuring cups Jonathan has.
2. Determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has.
3. Subtract the number of measuring spoons gifted to Pedro from the initial number of measuring spoons.
4. Add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to get the total number of utensils.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

2. Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially.

3. Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. The number of measuring spoons remaining is:
   \[
   16 - 6 = 10
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 10 measuring spoons remaining.

4. The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
   \[
   24 + 10 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Emails Sent per Day**: Robyn sends 16 emails a day.

2. **Work Emails**: Robyn sends 7 work emails a day.

3. **Remaining Emails**: Subtract the work emails from the total emails.
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 emails remaining after sending the work emails.

4. **Family Emails**: Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, Robyn sends 6 emails to her family.

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation. We get:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught is \( 147 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the length of each episode.
2. Determine the total number of episodes.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Given:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

First, let's find the total number of episodes. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Minutes per episode}}{2} \]

Substituting the given value for the minutes per episode:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know there are 10 episodes, and each episode is 20 minutes long. To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Minutes per episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. She gave each 2 boxes, so she gave away a total of:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtracting the boxes given away from the initial total, we find the number of boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 100 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S_{USA} \). Therefore, \( S_{USA} = 50 \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in India as \( S_{India} \). Therefore, we can write the equation for \( S_{India} \) as:
\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} S_{USA} + 4 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_{USA} \):
\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 + 4 \]
\[ S_{India} = 25 + 4 \]
\[ S_{India} = 29 \]

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
\[ S_{India} + S_{USA} = 29 + 50 = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide $25 by $5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Thus, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cherries**: There are 60 cherries in total.
2. **Robert's Cherries**: Robert has 30 cherries.
3. **Richard's Cherries**: Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
4. **Jerry's Cherries**: To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries. So, Jerry has \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\) cherries.
5. **Difference in Cherries Between Robert and Jerry**: Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. Therefore, Robert has \(30 - 10 = 20\) more cherries than Jerry.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the gingerbread and apple pie.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Price per box of gingerbread: $6
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Price per box of apple pie: $15
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we sum up the total earnings from both days.

**Total earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is \(\boxed{465}\)."

"To find the cost of the red car, we first calculate 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:

\[ \$60 + \$100 = \$160 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$160 \]"
"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E = 19 \) years. When Emil turns 24, his age will be 24 years. At that time, his dad's age will be \( D + 24 - 19 = D + 5 \) and his brother's age will be \( B + 24 - 19 = B + 5 \).

According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Also, when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each source and then sum them up.

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Therefore, her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Therefore, her friend gave her \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, we sum the beads from each source:
\[ 20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To determine the total number of servings Joe has, we need to calculate the amount of crawfish he caught each day and then convert that total into servings.

First, we know that on Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to convert the total pounds of crawfish into servings. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band. These 6 students will need to leave early to travel to the away game. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size 5 and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times \text{Size of Sophie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, we have the sizes of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots: 25 and 5, respectively. To find the average size, we sum these sizes and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Thus, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend, we need to calculate the number of additional plants she needs to buy. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the length of the flower bed to inches:**
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the space occupied by each plant including the space between them:**
   Each plant is 12 inches wide and there is 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) of space between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   \[
   \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

4. **Determine the number of additional plants needed:**
   Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 additional plants is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:
\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels his brother eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the flowers in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost per basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. With 4 sunflowers, the total soil used by the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. With 10 carnations, the total soil used by the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

The total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations is:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil available for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil remaining, the number of roses that can be planted is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how many months are in a year and then divide her total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of months in a year} = 12 \]

\[ \text{Total savings in a year} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Emily spends peeling the shrimp and the time she spends sautéing the shrimp separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time Emily spends peeling 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time Emily spends sautéing 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to sauté 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent peeling and sautéing:
\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Change in Temperature:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the time interval between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

Now, we calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
- Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \), and the number of flights to France and Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) each.

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88. \]

Now, we can determine the number of flights to France. Since the first plane makes 88 flights in a day, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

Next, we sum the durations of all three wolves' howls:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds} \):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

1. The cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, we add the money given by his mother and father:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

Next, we subtract the total amount of money given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we calculate the total age of the children:
\[A + B + H + W = 20\]
Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice in relation to the others.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume of the watermelon \( V \) is equal to \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets a slice of volume \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on each activity.

1. **Time spent at the clinic:** 9 hours.
2. **Time spent on rounds:** 20 minutes per inpatient, and there are 9 inpatients.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} \times 9 \text{ inpatients} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting 180 minutes to hours:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Time spent on appointments:** 30 minutes per appointment, and there are 10 appointments.
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes/appointment} \times 10 \text{ appointments} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting 300 minutes to hours:
   \[
   300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Next, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total time available (which is 24 hours, since a day has 24 hours):
\[
24 \text{ hours} - 17 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented for 3 * 4 = 12 sessions in a month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m \).

We are given:
- Peter has 64 chocolate bars, so \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so \( 7m = 56 \).

We can solve for \( p \) and \( m \) from these equations:
\[ 4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, the number of additional chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes compared to each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of porcupines after a year:**
   The initial number of porcupines is 50. Adding the babies born in a year gives:
   \[
   \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the cost per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Calculate the volume:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Calculate the volume in gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = \text{Volume in gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Calculate the cost:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
   \[
   9 + 14 + 11 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To determine the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[
\boxed{1875}

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
  \[
  \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day.

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Now, we sum up the total amount of water pumped over the two days.

- Total water pumped by Wanda:
  \[
  4500 + 3000 = 7500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Total water pumped by Ms. B:
  \[
  3375 + 1125 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Total water pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B:
  \[
  7500 + 4500 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining.

- Remaining water in the tank:
  \[
  18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. Therefore, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. Therefore, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. So we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.6118 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.8035 \]
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \approx 0.6118 \times 0.8035 \approx 0.492 \]

So we have:
\[ 0.492 = 0.28 \]

This means:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.492} \approx 0.568 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 56.8%. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56.8} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.
3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.**

The cost of the car is $10000. Therefore, 20% of $10000 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2000.

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \times 40 + 15 \times 40 = 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, Janet earns $1000 per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000.**

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches is \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars.
- The cost of 4 pears is \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 kiwis is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 apples is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars.

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount of money he has left to spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars.

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy with $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[3\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% annually, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value of the price.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual rate of increase (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to first understand how the pictures are distributed among the albums. We know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums being selfies only and 2 albums being portraits only. This means the remaining albums are for other categories, but we don't need to know the specifics of those for this problem.

First, we calculate the number of pictures in the selfies-only albums:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 4 \text{ pictures/album} = 12 \text{ pictures} \]

Next, we calculate the number of pictures in the portraits-only albums:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 4 \text{ pictures/album} = 8 \text{ pictures} \]

Now, we can find the total number of pictures in the selfies-only and portraits-only albums:
\[ 12 \text{ pictures} + 8 \text{ pictures} = 20 \text{ pictures} \]

Since the total number of pictures uploaded is 72, the number of pictures in the remaining albums is:
\[ 72 \text{ pictures} - 20 \text{ pictures} = 52 \text{ pictures} \]

The problem does not specify how these remaining 52 pictures are distributed among the other albums, but it asks for the number of portraits and selfies. Since we already know the number of selfies and portraits in the albums specifically designated for them, the final answer is:
\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 8 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

1. **Early Checkouts:**
   - 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests remaining: \( 100 - 24 = 76 \).

2. **Late Checkouts:**
   - 15 guests checked out late.
   - Guests remaining: \( 76 - 15 = 61 \).

3. **Guests Checking In:**
   - Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of guests who checked in: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \).
   - Guests after new arrivals: \( 61 + 30 = 91 \).

4. **Additional Guests:**
   - 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \), we have:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine how many eggs the friends found, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins.
2. Subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs.
3. Subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by the friends from the remaining eggs to find out how many eggs the friends found.

Let's start with the first step:
The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, we subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by the friends from the remaining eggs:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the friends found:
\[ \boxed{30} \text{ eggs} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining rate per dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Calculate the total ore mining for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over 30 days.

**Step 1: Determine the ore mining rate per dwarf with a steel pickaxe.**

- A dwarf with a bare hand mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
- A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines twice as much as a dwarf with a bare hand, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

So, each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.**

- If one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes will mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total ore mining for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over 30 days.**

- If 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, then over 30 days they will mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

Therefore, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is \(\boxed{43200}\) pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportionality between the number of sandwiches and the price. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( P \).

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is:
\[
8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of balloons at each step.

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Red balloons: 25
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 12
   - Blue balloons: 8

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - 40% of the red balloons burst.
   - Number of red balloons that burst: \( 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \)
   - Remaining red balloons: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.
   - Number of yellow balloons released: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

4. **Adding Blue Balloons:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch.
   - Number of blue balloons added: \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \)
   - Total blue balloons: \( 8 + 6 = 14 \)

5. **Total Number of Balloons Carried into School:**
   - Red balloons: 15
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 6
   - Blue balloons: 14
   - Total: \( 15 + 7 + 6 + 14 = 42 \)

Thus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios that prevent him from having to turn it in.

1. **Probability that a substitute teacher will come in:**
   \[
   P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50
   \]

2. **Probability that the normal teacher will give an extension:**
   \[
   P(\text{Extension from normal teacher}) = 0.40
   \]

3. **Probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment:**
   \[
   P(\text{Personal extension}) = 0.20
   \]

The scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework are:
- The substitute teacher comes in and gives an extension.
- The normal teacher gives an extension.
- Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these scenarios:
\[
P(\text{No homework}) = P(\text{Substitute}) \times P(\text{Extension from normal teacher}) + P(\text{Substitute}) \times P(\text{Personal extension}) + P(\text{Normal teacher}) \times P(\text{Extension from normal teacher})
\]

Since the probability of the normal teacher coming in is \(1 - P(\text{Substitute}) = 0.50\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
P(\text{No homework}) = 0.50 \times 0.40 + 0.50 \times 0.20 + 0.50 \times 0.40
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20
\]
\[
0.50 \times 0.20 = 0.10
\]
\[
0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20
\]

Adding these probabilities together:
\[
P(\text{No homework}) = 0.20 + 0.10 + 0.20 = 0.50
\]

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in:
\[
P(\text{Homework}) = 1 - P(\text{No homework}) = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[
P(\text{Homework}) = 0.50 \times 100\% = 50\%
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[
\boxed{50\%}
\]"
"To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive to give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty.
2. Divide this number by the total number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive.

First, we calculate the number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty:
\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} - 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 5750 \text{ (seats for others)} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the graduates. Let's denote the number of graduates by \( G \). The number of tickets each graduate will receive is:
\[ \frac{5750}{G} \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we assume that the question is asking for the number of tickets each graduate would receive if the total number of graduates is the only variable. If we assume the number of graduates is \( G \), then each graduate would receive:
\[ \frac{5750}{G} \]

However, if we are to provide a numerical answer based on the information given and assuming the number of graduates is the only variable, we can't provide a specific numerical answer without knowing \( G \). If we assume the problem is asking for a general formula or a specific numerical answer based on a typical graduation scenario where the number of graduates is a reasonable number, we can assume a typical number of graduates, say 500, for the sake of providing a numerical answer.

If there are 500 graduates:
\[ \frac{5750}{500} = 11.5 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, and typically in such scenarios, we would round down to the nearest whole number, each graduate would receive 11 tickets.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"To determine how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate her total earnings from jury duty.
3. Calculate her total expenses.
4. Determine her net earnings.
5. Calculate her net earnings per hour.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.**

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her total earnings from jury duty.**

Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate her total expenses.**

Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine her net earnings.**

Subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate her net earnings per hour.**

Divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Thus, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at $16 each:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is:

\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to place the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next one, he will make a total of 7 trips (from the first to the second, from the second to the third, and so on, until the seventh to the eighth).

Each trip takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time for all the trips is:
\[
7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds per trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine the total number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has.

Given:
- There are 40 apples in one box.
- Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples.

First, we calculate the total number of apples:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of 8 apples each can be made from the total 80 apples:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ apples}}{8 \text{ apples/pack}} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese she buys and then subtract this total from the $50 she starts with.

First, calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

Finally, subtract the total cost from the $50 Amor starts with to find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) dollars.

Thus, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim took 4 years to finish college.
- He borrowed $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total amount borrowed is \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- He would have worked for 4 years.
- Therefore, the total income he would have earned is \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During his college years, he would have earned $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total income he would have earned during college is \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

The total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000, and the total income he would have earned during his college years is $200,000. Therefore, the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is:
\[ 100,000 + 200,000 = 300,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn $300,000 if he had a $25,000 a year job:
\[ \frac{300,000}{25,000} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it would take Jim 12 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
   - Length: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) feet
   - Width: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) feet

2. Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
   - Area = Length × Width = \( 8 \times 10 = 80 \) square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
   - Total area = \( 80 \times 2 = 160 \) square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Then, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"

For the chicken salad:
- Number of people: 10
- Cost per person: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 * $6.50 = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for both salads:
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to this, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars. Therefore, he did not lose any money in the second race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, we sum up the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}
\]"
"To find the total population in South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities combined.

Given:
- There are 26 countries in South America.
- Each country has 5 cities.
- Each city has 1000 people.

First, we calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[ \text{Total number of cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Number of cities per country} = 26 \times 5 = 130 \]

Next, we calculate the total population by multiplying the total number of cities by the population of each city:
\[ \text{Total population} = \text{Total number of cities} \times \text{Population per city} = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000 \]

Therefore, the total population in South America is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by the team.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by the team. They worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day, so the total number of hours worked by the team is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{7.875 \text{ hours}}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{1.96875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
\[ \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the car in 2009:
\[ \text{Price in 2009} = \text{Price in 2008} \times 0.79 = (20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79^2 \]

Finally, we calculate the price of the car in 2010:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = \text{Price in 2009} \times 0.79 = (20000 \times 0.79^2) \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, we compute the numerical value:
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.624159 \]
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.624159 = 12483.18 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{12483.18} \]"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books:
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance.

\[ \text{Distance remaining} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people after boarding} = 90 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 190 - 80 = 110

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1 ft by 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \, \text{tiles} \times \$12 \, \text{per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the additional cost as follows:
\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this to the normal monthly cost gives the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   Jill and her friends watch 4 movies on Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, we calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day:
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
- Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day}\).
- For 3 cats, the total consumption per day is \(120 \text{ grams per cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day}\).

Next, we determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
- We divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption.
- So, \(720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams per day} = 2 \text{ days}\).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 4 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so we have:

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so the number of slices Silvia ate is:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the charges for the visit, the cast, and the parking. The cost for the cast is $200. The cost for the painkillers is $4 per pill for 30 pills, which is $4 * 30 = $120. The cost for the parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12. The cost for the visit is $300 for a 30-minute visit.

Now, we sum up all these costs:
- Cost of the cast: $200
- Cost of the painkillers: $120
- Cost of the visit: $300
- Cost of the parking: $12

Adding these together, we get:
$200 + $120 + $300 + $12 = $632

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $632."
"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by the number of work days in a week.

First, we know that James gets 80 emails a day and 20% of these emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes visited.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes visited.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, we add the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left.

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony is sending.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

So, after Mark ate 4 sandwiches, Sidney had 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. This means the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had is now:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
   - Total initial tons of fertiliser = 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons.

2. **Mechanical Failures**: A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.
   - Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks.
   - Number of trucks that successfully delivered = 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks.

3. **Fertiliser Delivered**: Each of the 15 trucks successfully delivered 20 tons of fertiliser.
   - Total tons of fertiliser delivered = 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \) of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- For the first 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the next 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the last 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.

Since the promotion applies to every 2 pounds, Dennis will pay for 3 sets of 2 pounds:
- \( 3 \times 4.00 = 12.00 \)

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. 

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The additional cost for these 21 guests is:

- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party:

- Total cost = Base rental fee + Additional cost
- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is:

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys over the course of a week.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Over a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   Over a week (7 days), the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys over a week is:
   \[
   70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey over a week is:
   \[
   315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey over a week by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she is short by:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Jenny needs an additional $5 to buy the roses. Since the florist only has quarters (25 cents each) for change, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive in change. Since she needs $5 in change, the number of quarters she will receive is:
\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 minutes + 5 minutes = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 minutes + 20 minutes = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Since she has already saved 120 toothpicks, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If Melanie continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of additional weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining Binkie's score and using the relationship given in the problem.

Binkie's score is given as 90.

Frankie's score is described as 15 more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 180 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - James walks halfway to the store.
   - The distance to the store is 4 miles.
   - Halfway is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - Time taken for the first segment is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - James realizes he forgot something and walks back home.
   - The distance back is 2 miles.
   - He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - Time taken for the second segment is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time taken for both segments.
   - Total time = \( 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each bunch costs $0.80.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Therefore, the total cost if bought individually is:
  \[
  10 \text{ bunches} \times \$0.80 \text{ per bunch} = \$8.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Therefore, the total cost if bought in bunches is:
  \[
  10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00
  \]

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings:
\[
\$30.00 - \$8.00 = \$22.00
\]

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{22}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence between them is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Number of Trekking bikes sold: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
   - Number of BMX bikes sold: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - Number of MTB bikes sold: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Price of one Trekking bike: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

3. **Calculate the total earnings from all bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales of hay over that period.

First, let's calculate the number of bales the farmer makes in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales made by the farmer} = 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of bales the truck picks up in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales picked up by the truck} = 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we find the net change in the number of bales of hay by subtracting the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ \text{Net change in bales} = 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Since the net change is positive, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:
\[ \text{Bales left} = 12 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height of the ball after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the ball on its second bounce will be \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height after the first bounce:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the ball on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:
\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:
\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, and this amount is given as 270 kilograms. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Thus, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the distribution of the sodas after Ellen's actions.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. She then takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

At this point, the distribution is:
- 8 unshaken sodas
- 3 shaken sodas

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves:
- 6 unshaken sodas
- 2 shaken sodas

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The friend can choose from the remaining 8 sodas (6 unshaken and 2 shaken). The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at a speed of half of 60 miles per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply that by the number of people he can help per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to determine how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days Billy works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he can help per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Finally, the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works is:
\[ 40 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ people/day} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract this from the total number of people present at the ceremony.

First, we calculate the number of people transported by the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

Next, we calculate the number of people transported by the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people transported by the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

Now, we sum the number of people transported by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people present at the ceremony:
- Total number of people transported by buses: \(12 \times 35 = 420\).
- Total number of people transported by cars: \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
- Total number of people present at the ceremony: \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Since Mary and John got married, we assume that the total number of people present at the ceremony includes them. Therefore, the number of people inside the church is the total number of people present minus 2 (Mary and John):

\[
480 - 2 = 478
\]

Thus, the number of people inside the church is \(\boxed{478}\)."

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

The time \( t_1 \) to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_1 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

The time \( t_2 \) to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_2 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = t_1 - t_2 = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to first calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks per day, and then multiply that by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each per day. So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch per day is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour on his lunches and breaks per day.

After 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Amber ran 8 miles.

Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so:
\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. Therefore, the distance Ahito ran can be calculated by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:
\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.
5. Add the discounted costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.
6. The final balance will be the sum of the remaining balance after the return and the discounted costs of the frying pan and the set of towels.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of the frying pan after a 20% discount: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - ($20.00 * 0.20) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels after a 10% discount: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - ($30.00 * 0.10) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Adding the discounted costs to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To determine Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Chris's Age**: We are given that Chris is 4 years old.
   \[
   \text{Chris's age} = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough money for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \) dollars.

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:
- She needs to save $40,000 per year for 20 years.
- Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Thus, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. The length of each of these parts is:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts is divided into 5 equal parts. The length of each of these smaller parts is:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \). According to the problem, 40% of \( N \) is equal to 240 boys. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we need to solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Performing the division:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - \text{Number of boys} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil, and then subtract the value of the coupon.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
The value of the coupon is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the mean of the heights of the heels worn by the women at the party. 

Given:
- Three women are wearing 4 inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2 inch heels.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height from the 4 inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Total height from the 2 inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we find the combined total height of all heels:
- Combined total height: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

There are a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) women at the party.

Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:
- Average height of the heels: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the number of miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey on time.
5. Find the difference between the required daily hike and the planned daily hike.

First, we know that Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

Next, we calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Finally, we find the difference between the required daily hike and the planned daily hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

1. **Total Apples Purchased**: Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples.

2. **Peter's Share**: Peter wants a quarter of the total apples.
   \[
   \text{Peter's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Paul's Share**: Paul wants one-third of the total apples.
   \[
   \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Total Apples Taken by Peter and Paul**: 
   \[
   \text{Total taken by Peter and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}

"First, let's determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she has spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Out of this $14, she has already spent $4 on other items. Therefore, the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Anna bought 2 books, and each book cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book by \( x \). Since she bought 2 books, the total cost for the books is:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
- Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
- Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, this total distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we have:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The total production rate is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The four workers work for a 10-hour shift, so the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in that time is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, the first four workers only produced 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs and then sum them with Kory's dog.

First, we know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we sum the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, which means he gave away \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 \) stickers to Rob.
4. According to the problem, Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
   \]
5. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16 \implies S = 64

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam's age two years ago was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \(V\). Therefore, we have the equation:
\[14 = 2V\]

Solving for \(V\):
\[V = \frac{14}{2} = 7\]

So, Vince's age two years ago was 7 years. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
\[7 + 2 = 9\]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We are given that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each.

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes together gives:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow the steps of his process and calculate the number of planks he can produce and subsequently the total revenue from selling them.

1. **Determine the length of logs John can make:**
   - The tree is 80 feet long.
   - He can make logs out of 80% of the tree.
   - Therefore, the length of each log is:
     \[
     80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of 4-foot logs John can make:**
   - Each log is 64 feet long.
   - Each log is cut into 4-foot sections.
   - Therefore, the number of 4-foot logs is:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of planks John can make from each log:**
   - Each 4-foot log is cut into 5 planks.
   - Therefore, the total number of planks is:
     \[
     16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks}
     \]

4. **Determine the total revenue from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
     \[

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 2v = 40 \]
Solving for \( v \), we get:
\[ v = 20 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. Thus, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{40 \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ minutes} = 0.025 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on both segments to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 0.025 \text{ minutes} = 40.025 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{40.025} \]"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 each week for the past 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane needs a total of $60. The amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} + 24 = 60 \]

Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as \( x \). Then we have:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. After these actions, the water in the 33-degree mug is reduced to \( 4 \) ounces, and the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is still 33 degrees. The water in the other mug is reduced to \( T - 1 \) degrees, and the temperature of the water in the other mug is \( T \) degrees.

After pouring, Donny can drink the water if the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is at least 40 degrees. Since the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, the only way for Donny to be able to drink the water is if the temperature of the water in the other mug, after the 1 ounce is poured out, is at least 40 degrees. This means:

\[ T - 1 \geq 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T \geq 41 \]

Therefore, the second bottle of water must be at least 41 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 41 \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Number of cows added per day: 20
- Number of days in three weeks: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

The total number of cows added over 21 days is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Adding the initial number of cows to the cows added:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Number of chickens added per day: 10
- Number of days in three weeks: 21 days

The total number of chickens added over 21 days is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Adding the initial number of chickens to the chickens added:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we sum the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Applying the 10% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total number of bagels in 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 1 less than 3 scoops is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days is:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days is:
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Adding the eggs consumed in both periods gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[
90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
\]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[
\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then extend that to 3 days.

From the problem, we know:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
\]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

To find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 84 \times 3 = 252
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{252}
\]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam sells:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 60\% \text{ of total rocks} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \text{Number of rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of buying the rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Number of rocks} \times \text{Cost per rock} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the loss:**
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Adam loses \(\boxed{16}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we first need to find the probability of winning for each ticket.

Let's denote the probability of winning the first ticket as \( P_1 \). According to the problem, \( P_1 = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \), which simplifies to \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( 22 = 2R \), which simplifies to \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided these seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and on weekends separately, and then sum them up.

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend.

First, we calculate the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots eaten on the weekend:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, the selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price:
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mobile devices bought. Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
The total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Since he sold each of the 6 devices for $40, the total revenue is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

2. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, subtract the current production from the total required: \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce \(\boxed{7300}\) more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to two decimal places for simplicity, we can consider it as 1 baby, as we are dealing with whole babies)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of land sold:**
   - Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
   - He sold half of the land: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After a month, he sold another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his land: \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.
   - The remaining land is: \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \) square meters.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from the sales:**
   - Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \) square meters at $50 per square meter: \( 40 \times 50 = 2000 \) dollars.
   - Revenue from the second sale: \( 20 \) square meters at $30 per square meter: \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Revenue from the remaining land: \( 20 \) square meters at $3 per square meter: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Sum up the total revenue:**

"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \times 2 = 6\) face masks.

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use \(6 \times 2 = 12\) face masks.

Thus, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, and one dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll determine how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
2. Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.
3. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.
4. Compute the total amount of money John makes in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.**

Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined total of the first two complexes.
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex.
\[ 3 \times (400 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \]

**Step 4: Compute the total amount of money John makes in a week.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Thus, the total amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2350}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Jack originally had $100, and after receiving $20 from Sophia, he now has:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substituting \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \( R_r \) and the amount given to Ronnie as \( R_n \). According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so we have:

\[ R_r = 3R_n \]

Ronnie was given $5, so:

\[ R_n = 5 \]

Therefore, Rissa was given:

\[ R_r = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

From this, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural. Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal.
3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we sum up all the areas to find the total area of the house:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs.
- On Tuesday, she counts double the number of puffs from Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
- On Wednesday, she counts double the number of puffs from Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
- On Thursday, she counts double the number of puffs from Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
- On Friday, she counts double the number of puffs from Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Since each cycle uses 1 pod, for $1, you can run \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10."
"First, we determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, and he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]
This means the amount of chalk remaining after Monday is:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it. Let's denote the number of days he can continue using the chalk as \( n \). Each day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk, so the amount of chalk remaining after \( n \) days is:
\[ 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20)^n = 2.75 \times (0.80)^n \]
We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches (the threshold for recycling):
\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]
Dividing both sides by 2.75, we get:
\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{8}{11} \]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[ n \ln(0.80) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]
Since \(\ln(0.80)\) is negative, we can divide both sides by \(\ln(0.80)\) and reverse the inequality:
\[ n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.80)} \]
Calculating the values of the logarithms, we get:
\[ \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.2927 \]
\[ \ln(0.80) \approx -0.2231 \]
So,
\[ n > \frac{-0.2927}{-0.2231} \approx 1.31 \]
Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2. Therefore, the teacher can continue using the chalk for 2 more days before he has to recycle it.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
3. Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's find the number of boys on varsity. There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[
\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 12 + 12 = 24
\]

Finally, we find the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled by the dentist:**
   James' dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped by the dentist:**
   The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
   \[
   4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
   \[
   4 + 11 = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   To find the percentage of James' teeth that are fixed, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[

"To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age by \( C \) and Wendy's current age by \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Rearrange to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \). To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
And check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]
Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per $500:

\[ \text{Number of books per $500} = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how many $500 units are in $27,000:

\[ \text{Number of $500 units in $27,000} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy with $27,000 is:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob distributes the $27,000 among 3 schools, so the number of books he can buy per school is:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza that her friends eat.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required to satisfy these totals.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \div 12 = 3\).
- Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \div 8 = 3\).
- Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy both types of pizzas in whole numbers, and the calculations show she needs 3 of each, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:
\[3 \text{ (cheese pizzas)} + 3 \text{ (pepperoni pizzas)} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce in an hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time it will take before Jay has 60 snowballs is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age based on the information given about John's age and their ages at the time Digimon came out.

1. **Determine John's age at the time Digimon came out:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, John's age at the time Digimon came out was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between John's and Jim's ages at the time Digimon came out:**
   - At the time Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \( J \) represent Jim's age at the time Digimon came out.
   - According to the problem, \( 8 = 2J \).

3. **Solve for Jim's age at the time Digimon came out:**
   - \( 8 = 2J \)
   - Divide both sides by 2: \( J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, Jim's current age is \( 4 + 20 = 24 \).

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 24 \]"
"To determine the total number of apple slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother, we can follow these steps:

1. **Doxa's Slice:**
   Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

2. **Sister's Slice:**
   Doxa's sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa. Therefore, her sister ate:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Brother's Slice:**
   Doxa's brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. Therefore, her brother ate:
   \[
   2 + 1 = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   To find the total number of slices eaten by all three, we sum the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had 62 bandages at the start of the second day.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had 6 bandages left at the start of the third day.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 - 25 = -19\) bandages, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. Let's recheck the bandages they had at the start of the third day. They had 6 bandages left at the end of the second day, and they ordered 100 bandages, so they had \(6 + 100 = 106\) bandages at the start of the third day.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(106 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means they must have had 81 bandages at the start of the third day and used 3 bandages (since \(81 - 78 = 3\)).

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}

"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and then add the cost of the color.

1. **Calculate the length of the haircut:**
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.
   - The length of the haircut is \( 10 - 8 = 2 \) inches.

2. **Calculate the cost of the haircut:**
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - For 2 inches, the cost is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of the color is $40.
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: \( 40 + 60 = 100 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of May's hair cut and color is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

The total hours she works in a week is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \]

The total pay for a week is:
\[ 45 \text{ hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.5/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Over 4 weeks, the total attendance bonus is:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40 \]

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount of money he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
2. For doing the laundry: Jason did the laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the earnings from doing the laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
3. For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
4. For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

The final numerical answer is:
\[9.00\]"
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of blood in one shark.
2. Multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks.

First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:
\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:
\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later.
   - Number of people who came in later = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who came in by evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Sum the number of red and black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spends in total:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes.

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we have:
\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This is the total number of fish minus the number of fish with red stripes:
\[
\text{Number of fish without red stripes} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish (those without red stripes) have blue stripes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes:
\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors left is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set originally had 6 colors, half of these colors is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

So, after using up half of the colors from one makeup set, the number of eyeshadow colors left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[\boxed{19}\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the house and the first floor, and then use that information to find the height of the second floor's floor from the roof.

1. **Mattison's height:**
   \[
   \text{Mattison's height} = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Height of the two-story house:**
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Height of the first floor:**
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Height of the second floor:**
   \[
   \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor:**
   \[
   \text{Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor} = \text{Height of the first floor} = 180 \text{ inches}

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Determine the number of shells remaining after team Alphas.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:
\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we find out how many shells are left after team Alphas:
\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Then, we calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, who found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, we determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells:
\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

Thus, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles walked by all four dogs. Finally, we can determine the miles walked by the last dog.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Adding these together, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance walked by all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of the loan John gets. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]
   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many Jordan changes.

First, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan makes per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to consider the number of students and the number of students that can try the escape room at a time.

There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Therefore, the number of groups needed to accommodate all 30 students is:
\[ \lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \rceil = \lceil 3.75 \rceil = 4 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Thus, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{3 \text{ hours}} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cupcakes Carly made. Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

2. Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]

"To find the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we will calculate the price step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

2. **Price in December:**
   In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in December} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price in January:**
   In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease in January} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36

   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

   So, the sum of the scores is 630.

2. **Count the scores**: There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}

1. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate.
2. Determine the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some.
3. Calculate the number of apples given to his sister.
4. Determine the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister.
5. Calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them.
   \[
   \text{Number of apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, the number of apples remaining after eating is:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

2. Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.
   \[
   \text{Number of apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9
   \]
   So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27
   \]

3. Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each.

"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know the total time he spends traveling. However, the problem does not specify the total time spent traveling. For the sake of this problem, let's assume he travels continuously for 3 days without any breaks, which is 72 hours (3 days * 24 hours/day).

The distance traveled in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 72 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that 3600 km represents:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

1. **Grapes eaten by Madeline:**
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother:**
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes used by her brother is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Grapes remaining after her brother:**
   The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = \text{Remaining grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes used to make pies:**
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

5. **Total grapes at the beginning:**
   Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = 48
   \]
   Solving for the total number of grapes at the beginning:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} = 48 + 36 = 84

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:

"To determine the percentage of their day, on average, that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms.
2. Calculate the total number of hours in 5 days.
3. Determine the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms.**

The custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes per classroom.
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours in 5 days.**

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 5 days:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Determine the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Since the total time required is 1200 minutes, we convert this to hours:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The total time is spread over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The custodian works 8 hours per day, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Capacity of the top shelf: \( 20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books} \).

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Total capacity of one bookcase: \( 20 \text{ books (middle)} + 20 \text{ books (bottom)} + 15 \text{ books (top)} = 55 \text{ books} \).

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - Number of bookcases required: \( \frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books/bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases} \).

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the sale price of the bag of beef jerky.
2. Calculate the total number of sticks in the bag.
3. Convert the sale price to cents.

First, the original price of the bag is $18.00. Since there is a $3.00 discount, the sale price of the bag is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that each bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. Therefore, the cost per stick is:
\[ \frac{15.00 \text{ dollars}}{30 \text{ sticks}} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

To convert this cost to cents, we use the fact that 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey gets 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that one. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to ensure he meets or exceeds the 15 car sales target).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Number of Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 2 \times 8 = 4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.
   - So, there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.
   - The total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Number of Candles and Flashlights:**
   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of the number of flashlights and the number of candles.
   - This is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Thus, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is \(\boxed{56}\)."

Thus, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is \(\boxed{30}\) minutes."
"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to find out how many robots, helmets, and footballs are present in the changing room. We know that there are 20 helmets and that the number of helmets is half the number of robots, and the number of robots is half the number of footballs.

Let's denote the number of robots as \( R \) and the number of footballs as \( F \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The number of helmets \( H \) is 20.
2. The number of robots \( R \) is half the number of helmets, so \( R = \frac{H}{2} \).
3. The number of footballs \( F \) is twice the number of robots, so \( F = 2R \).

First, we substitute the number of helmets into the equation for the number of robots:
\[ R = \frac{20}{2} = 10. \]

Next, we use the number of robots to find the number of footballs:
\[ F = 2 \times 10 = 20. \]

Now we know the number of each type of item:
- Robots: 10
- Helmets: 20
- Footballs: 20

To find the total number of items, we sum these quantities:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 20 = 50. \]

Thus, the total number of items Dominick saw is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim works in a week. Since he works 5 days a week and each day he works 6 hours, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total hours worked in a week into minutes, since the time it takes to deal with a call is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we know that it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he deals with in a week, we divide the total number of minutes he works in a week by the time it takes to deal with one call:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the drying time for the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time with the old varnish is:
  \[
  7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the drying time for the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time with the new varnish is:
  \[
  12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:
\[
72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. The total distance is 200 yards, with half of it being 100 yards on land and the other half being 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute. Therefore, the time taken to hop 100 yards is:
\[
\text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His speed in water is 10 yards per minute. Therefore, the time taken to swim 100 yards is:
\[
\text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding the time taken for both segments of the journey, we get the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the cost for Bob to buy the popsicle sticks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, and Bob needs 7 boxes, so we multiply 7 by $2.00:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to first establish the cost of each phone. We know that the main phone costs $20 and that each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone.

Let's denote the cost of the main phone as \( C_m \) and the cost of each additional phone as \( C_a \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so we have:
\[ C_m = 2 \times C_a \]

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can substitute \( C_m \) with $20:
\[ 20 = 2 \times C_a \]

Solving for \( C_a \):
\[ C_a = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are four additional phones. The total cost of the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the phone plan:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 10 dozen doughnuts equal:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then find the total for the week.

First, let's find the number of people at the beach each day:
- On the first day, there were 50 people.
- On the second day, there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
- On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Let's denote the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days) is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over these three days is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]
This means:
\[ x + x + x = 180 \]
\[ 3x = 180 \]
\[ x = 60 \]
So, the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is 60 each.

Now, we can find the total number of people seen over the entire week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 400 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we need to break down the problem into the different time intervals and calculate the number of kernels popping in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 2 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate is three times the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 2 kernels / 30 seconds = \(\frac{2}{30} = \frac{1}{15}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(3 \times \frac{1}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop in the next 30 seconds = \(\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6\) kernels.

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate is four times the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = \(\frac{1}{15}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(4 \times \frac{1}{15} = \frac{4}{15}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop in the next 30 seconds = \(\frac{4}{15} \times 30 = 8\) kernels.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The rate is half the rate of the previous 30 seconds.
   - Rate in the final 30 seconds = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{15} = \frac{2}{15}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop in the final 30 seconds = \(\frac{2}{15} \times 30 = 4\) kernels.

Now, we sum the number of kernels that popped in each interval:
\[ 2 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 20 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 4 = 1 \]

Adding this to the total number of kernels popped:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"

"To determine the number of red blocks, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( r \).

According to the problem:
- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) yellow blocks.
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can now write the equation for the total number of blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + r \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + r = 32 \]
\[ 12 + r = 32 \]

To find \( r \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ r = 32 - 12 \]
\[ r = 20 \]

Thus, the number of red blocks is \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, determine the net distance from his starting point:
- He traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east.
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles east.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles east of his starting point. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year, which is $6300.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year, which is $4410.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To determine the number of pink candies, we first need to calculate the number of orange and yellow candies based on the given information.

1. The number of red candies is given as 54.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. Therefore, the number of pink candies is:
\[
\text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{43}

"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the bus travels. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs for the hotel and the bus travels:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during the trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Initially, Dallas has 21 marbles. After dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \text{ marbles} \]

Since Mazie originally had 52 marbles and Dallas ends up with 17 marbles after receiving some from Mazie and losing 4, the total number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie is:

\[ 17 + 4 = 21 \text{ marbles} \]

This means that the 21 marbles that Dallas received from Mazie are the sum of the marbles he originally had and the 4 marbles he dropped. Therefore, the number of marbles that Dallas received from Mazie is 21, and since Dallas received all of these from Mazie, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \]

Thus, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of adult tickets:**
   - There are 2 adults.
   - Each adult ticket costs $12.
   - Total cost for adult tickets = 2 adults * $12/adult = $24.

2. **Cost of child tickets:**
   - There is 1 child.
   - Each child ticket costs $8.
   - Total cost for child tickets = 1 child * $8/child = $8.

3. **Cost of popcorns:**
   - They buy 2 popcorns.
   - Each popcorn costs $3.
   - Total cost for popcorns = 2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum of the costs of adult tickets, child tickets, and popcorns.
   - Total cost = $24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

Therefore, the total amount they pay is $38."
"To determine the force required to move the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. Additionally, John has two children who each weigh 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of the car} + \text{Weight of the luggage} + \text{Weight of the two children}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + (75 \text{ pounds} \times 2)
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. Therefore, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

\[
\text{Force required} = 0.01 \times 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Force required} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Given that Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, and Mia is younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

\[ \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56 \]

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can calculate the average of their ages. The average of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

So, the average of their ages is 48. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Avery will spend on the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of one complete place setting and then multiply by the number of people.

A place setting consists of:
- 1 dinner plate
- 1 salad plate
- 1 bowl

The costs are:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

First, we calculate the cost of one place setting:
\[ \text{Cost of one place setting} = \text{Cost of dinner plate} + \text{Cost of salad plate} + \text{Cost of bowl} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one place setting} = 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, so she needs 12 place settings. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of one place setting} \times \text{Number of place settings} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00 \]

Thus, Avery will spend \(\boxed{180.00}\) on place settings."

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much feed is consumed in one week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.
2. Determine the number of packs of hot dogs required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.**

John invited 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of packs of hot dogs required.**

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs left over} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. Therefore, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.**

Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 6 packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies. Each tray costs $4:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

At this point, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

Thus, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[25\]"
"To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has to distribute.

- Meals given on Friday: 64
- Meals given on Saturday: 30
- Meals given on Sunday: 48

Adding these together:
\[ 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals to be distributed:
\[ 1360 - 142 = 1218 \]

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is:
\[ \boxed{1218} \]"

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to sum the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

We know the ages of the sisters:
- The first sister is 16 years old.
- The second sister is 16 years old.

So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 16 + 16 = 32 \]

We also know the age of one of the brothers:
- One brother is 12 years old.

We are told that this brother is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, the total age of the brothers is:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Now, we sum the total ages of the sisters and the brothers:
\[ 32 + 36 = 68 \]

Thus, the total age of all the siblings is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Meditation Time:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes each morning and 15 minutes each evening.
   - Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
   - Since she meditates 5 days a week, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

2. **Yoga Time:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) each day.
   - Since she practices yoga 5 days a week, the weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   - The total time spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks is the sum of the meditation time and the yoga time.
   - Total time = 600 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks is \(\boxed{30}\) hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum these values.

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower. We add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pens Timothy has.
2. Use the number of pens Timothy has to find out how many pens Sarah has.

"To determine Jackie's height before summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Anne's height.
2. Determine Jackie's height before summer.

First, we know that Albert is 36 inches tall. According to the problem, Anne is twice the height of Albert. Therefore, Anne's height is:
\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:
\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. Therefore, her height before summer was:

"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in one week.
3. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 bars per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so the number of bars produced in one week is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35000 \text{ bars/week} \]

Step 3: For two weeks, the number of bars produced is:
\[ 35000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 4: The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is:

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store offers a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. This means that for every two T-shirts, Jake pays full price for one and 50% of the price for the other.

The cost for the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost for the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4.

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]
So, the price Jake pays for the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Now, we sum the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left for the movie tickets:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide $13 by $6.50:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \text{ (with a remainder of 0.30)} \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, he can buy 2 movie tickets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in total, we need to calculate the total amount each of them spent and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
- Therefore, Ellen's total spending is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.
- Therefore, the cost of the two bathrobes is $100 * 2 = $200.
- Lani's total spending is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total spending to find the overall total:
- Ellen's total spending: $105
- Lani's total spending: $230
- Therefore, the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani is $105 + $230 = $335.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. With 32 quarters, the total value is:
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. With 95 dimes, the total value is:
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and then subtract that from the $40 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent:
- Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream.
- She spent $7.50 on a movie ticket for herself.
- She spent $7.50 on a movie ticket for her younger sister.
- She spent $8.50 on a bracelet.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 3.50 + 7.50 + 7.50 + 8.50 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 3.50 + 7.50 = 11.00 \]
\[ 11.00 + 7.50 = 18.50 \]
\[ 18.50 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

So, Janet spent a total of $27.00.

Next, we subtract the total amount spent from the $40 her parents gave her:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Janet has left is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days Josh works in a week.
2. Calculate the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Calculate his earnings over 2 weeks.

First, let's find out how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works on 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in a week he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, we calculate his earnings over 2 weeks:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each part would consist of 6 toy soldiers.

For the first part (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the second part (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Matthew would earn is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.

Total holes dug by the dog:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over time when Nate returns:
- Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day.
- The dog digs 6 holes per night.

Net holes filled per day:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given:
- Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.
- Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.

First, calculate the enrollment at Butler High School:
\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1000}

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

So, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chocolate chip cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Rainbow cookies} - \text{Oatmeal cookies} \]
\[ \text{Number of chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 2595 - 3075 \]

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

\[ 7995 - 2595 = 5400 \]
\[ 5400 - 3075 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
2. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
3. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
4. Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
5. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench can be expressed as:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 31 - 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- James is putting together 4 tables.
- Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:
- \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket. We know that the first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to determine how much each girl raised individually and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Alexandra raised $430. Let's denote the amount raised by Alexandra as \( A \). So, we have:
\[ A = 430 \]

Next, we know that Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. Let's denote the amount raised by Kim as \( K \). Therefore, we have:
\[ K = A + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. Let's denote the amount raised by Sarah as \( S \). Therefore, we have:
\[ S = 300 \]
\[ M = S + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700 \]
where \( M \) is the amount raised by Maryam.

Now, we can find the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam:
\[ \text{Total} = A + K + S + M = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:
\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Then:
\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Since Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, the total distance of the race is the sum of the distances they each ran:
\[ \text{Total distance} = D_A + 4 \text{ miles} \]

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can express the total distance as:
\[ \text{Total distance} = D_A + 4 \]

Since \( D_A = A \times 16 \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[ \text{Total distance} = A \times 16 + 4 \]

Now, we need to find the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute, and she ran 4 miles. The time \( T_V \) she took to run 4 miles is:
\[ T_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{V \text{ miles per minute}} \]

We know that \( A = 2V \), so substituting \( A \) in the equation for \( D_A \):
\[ D_A = 2V \times 16 = 32V \]

Thus, the total distance of the race is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 32V + 4 \]

Since the total distance is the same for both runners, we can equate the distances:
\[ 32V + 4 = 32V + 4 \]

This confirms the consistency of the distances. Now, we need to find \( V \). Since \( A = 2V \) and \( A \times 16 = 32V \), we can use the fact that the total distance is consistent. We need to find \( T_V \):
\[ T_V = \frac{4}{V} \]

Given that \( A = 2V \) and \( A \times 16 = 32V \), we can solve for \( V \) using the total distance:
\[ 32V + 4 = 32V + 4 \]

Since the total distance is consistent, we can directly find \( T_V \):
\[ T_V = \frac{4}{V} \]

Given \( A = 2V \) and \( A \times 16 = 32V \), we can solve for \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{32V}{16} = 2V \]

Thus, \( V = 2 \) miles per minute. Therefore:
\[ T_V = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 2 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line already available:
- The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line already available from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already available} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 594 \]"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one reservation:
- Each meal costs $5.
- Each bottle of wine costs $5.
- Therefore, for one reservation, the total cost is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for one night with 6 reservations:
- The total cost for 6 reservations is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we calculate the total weekly revenue:
- The total weekly revenue is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold them at a profit of 25%. To find the total selling price, we first calculate the profit amount and then add it to the original cost.

The profit amount is 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
4. James is 18 years old, and he is 3 years younger than John (since John was 19 when James was born).
5. Therefore, John is currently 18 + 3 = 21 years old.
6. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 32 - John's current age = 32 - 21 = 11 years old.
7. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \). We know two things:

1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices each person can have if Henry and his 3 friends (4 people in total) share the pizzas equally. We divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
