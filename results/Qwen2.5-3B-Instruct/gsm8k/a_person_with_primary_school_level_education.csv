"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. She uses 4 eggs to make muffins for her friends.
4. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

To find out how many eggs are left for sale, we subtract the eggs she eats and uses for muffins from the total eggs laid:

16 eggs (total) - 3 eggs (eaten) - 4 eggs (used for muffins) = 9 eggs left for sale.

Now, she sells each of these 9 eggs for $2 at the farmers' market.

To find out how much she makes in total, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.
In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's find out how much the house increased in value. The house was originally worth $80,000 and increased by 150%. To find 150% of $80,000, we calculate:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the house increased in value by $120,000. Now, we add this increase to the original value of the house to find the new value:

\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price + repair cost) from the new value of the house:

\[ 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints each time, so in one week, he runs:
3 sprints/sprint * 3 times/week = 9 sprints/week

Each sprint is 60 meters, so in one week, he runs:
9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

The final numerical answer is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives to her chickens in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed needed for all the chickens in a day is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.
2. The first glass costs $5.
3. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every two glasses, the cost is:
- First glass: $5
- Second glass: $3

This means for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Now, let's see how many sets of two glasses Kylar is buying:
- Kylar wants 16 glasses, so he needs 8 sets of two glasses (16 / 2 = 8).

The cost for 8 sets of two glasses is:
- 8 sets * $8 per set = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"First, let's find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

\[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:

\[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:

\[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 260."
"First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. The file is 200 GB and she has downloaded 40% of it.

40% of 200 GB is:
\( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB

So, she has 80 GB downloaded before the restart. Now, she needs to download the remaining part of the file.

The remaining part of the file is:
\( 200 - 80 = 120 \) GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute. To find out how long it takes to download the remaining 120 GB, we divide the remaining GB by her download speed:

\( 120 \div 2 = 60 \) minutes

The restart took 20 minutes, so the total time to download the file is:

\( 60 + 20 = 80 \) minutes

So, the total load to download the file is 80 minutes."
"First, let's break down the journey into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

1. **First part of the journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second part of the journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 0 mph * 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third part of the journey:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth part of the journey:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time for the fourth part = 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 315 miles."
"Eliza worked 45 hours this week. The first 40 hours are at her regular rate of $10 per hour. The remaining 5 hours are overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, let's add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month. So, \(60 \times 3 = 180\) downloads.
3. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we calculate \(180 \times 0.30 = 54\). So, the downloads in the third month were \(180 - 54 = 126\).

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[60 + 180 + 126 = 366\]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

1. Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen
   - 3 * $68 = $204

2. Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
   - 2 * $80 = $160

3. Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen
   - 6 * $55 = $330

Now, let's add up the costs of all the pastries:
- $204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694

So, the total cost is $694."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. Each year, the tree gives 7 lemons.
3. Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
4. Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.

First, we need to find out how much money Carlos gets from selling the lemons each year. He gets 7 lemons and each lemon is sold for $1.5, so:

\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, we need to find out the net profit each year. The profit is the money he gets from selling the lemons minus the cost to water and feed the tree:

\[ \$10.5 \text{ (from lemons)} - \$3 \text{ (cost to water and feed)} = \$7.5 \text{ profit per year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. We do this by dividing the cost to plant the tree by the profit he makes each year:

\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. This means she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) left.
3. Then she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So now she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.
4. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. So she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. This means she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) left.
5. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. First, simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
2. Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
3. Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is:

\( 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance.

Now, we subtract the 4 students from the total to find out how many students are left:

\( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students

Next, we find out how many of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is:

\( 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students

So, 4 students are in jazz dance.

Now, we subtract the 4 students who are in jazz dance from the remaining 16 students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

\( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students

Therefore, 12 students are in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\( \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \)

So, the final numerical answer is 60%."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the increase in value for each item and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the increase for the jewelry:
- The jewelry is worth $5,000.
- It will increase by 2.5%.
- To find the increase, we calculate 2.5% of $5,000.
- 2.5% of $5,000 = (2.5/100) * $5,000 = $125.

So, the jewelry will be worth $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

Next, let's calculate the increase for the electronic gadgets:
- The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000.
- They will increase by 1.2%.
- To find the increase, we calculate 1.2% of $8,000.
- 1.2% of $8,000 = (1.2/100) * $8,000 = $96.

So, the electronic gadgets will be worth $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Now, we need to find out which option gives more profit:
- If the merchant chooses the jewelry, the profit is $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.
- If the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets, the profit is $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

Since $125 is more than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The maximum profit the merchant can make is $125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.
   - So, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.
   - So, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.

3. **Total Distance Covered:**
   - To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on both days.
   - Each train covers 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles in total.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching, then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.
- She works 50 weeks a year, so her annual earnings from teaching are $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.
- She works 50 weeks a year, so her annual earnings from coaching are $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500.

Now, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Her total annual salary is $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she makes 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. In 4 weeks, she makes 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs. To do this, we divide 84 by 12: 84 ÷ 12 = 7.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Marissa has a 12-mile trail to hike. She has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another 1 hour

So far, she has walked a total of 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

She has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

To find out what speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

We want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles. Let's denote the time she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles as \( t \) hours. So, the total time will be \( 1 + 1 + t = 2 + t \) hours.

Using the average speed formula:

\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + t} \]

To find \( t \), we solve the equation:

\[ 4(2 + t) = 12 \]
\[ 8 + 4t = 12 \]
\[ 4t = 12 - 8 \]
\[ 4t = 4 \]
\[ t = 1 \]

So, Marissa needs 1 more hour to walk the remaining 6 miles. Now, we calculate her speed for the remaining 6 miles:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters of water.

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) liters of water.

Now, we add the water from both drinks:

\( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters of water.

But we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total volume:

\( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters of orange drink remaining.

Now, we add the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink:

\( 9 + 15 = 24 \) liters of mixed drink.

Since we already know that there are \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink, we can state the final amount of water:

\( \frac{47}{3} \) liters of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\( \frac{47}{3} \)"
"First, let's find out how old Samantha was when Raymond had his son. Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23 and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate how old Samantha was when Raymond had his son:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid $19.50 which is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's call the original price of the book ""P"". So, 75% of P is $19.50.

To find P, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \]

Now, to find P, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items Marie ordered that we know the price for:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk at $3 each: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples at $1.50 each: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, let's add up these known costs:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.

So, the total cost for the pants is:
\[ 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.

So, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 3 \times 42 = 126 \]

Now, we add up the total cost for all the items:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

60 servings ÷ 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Each carton costs $4.00. So, for 4 cartons, she will spend:

4 cartons × $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final numerical answer is $16.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Darrell and Allen are now, and then calculate how old Allen will be 10 years from now.

First, let's understand the ratio given: Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means if we let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a common factor.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. So we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
To find x, we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now we can find Darrell's and Allen's ages:
Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

Next, we need to find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[\boxed{109}\]"
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

To find the average guess, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
240 ÷ 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to take care of. John has 10 dogs. So, 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours a day he spends taking care of the dogs. There are 7 days in a week, so 5 * 7 = 35 hours a week.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's say Gretchen has \( S \) silver coins.
2. Then she has \( S + 30 \) gold coins (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins).
3. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 30) = 110
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2S + 30 = 110
   \]
5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 80
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   S = 40

"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. So, half of Raymond's jewels is:

40 / 2 = 20 jewels

Aaron has 5 more jewels than this amount, so:

20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, if Aaron has 25 jewels, then Siobhan has:

25 - 2 = 23 jewels

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, to find the total points he scored, we add the points from both parts:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one yogurt costs. If 4 yogurts cost $5.00, then one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in one day, he spends $1.25 * 2 = $2.50 on yogurt.

Over 30 days, he will spend $2.50 * 30 = $75.00 on yogurt.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each and he has 13 lego sets. So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He uses this $195 to buy 8 video games for $20 each. The total cost for the 8 video games is:
8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So, the total amount of money he had initially is the sum of the money from selling the lego sets and the money he has left:
$195 + $5 = $200

Now, to find out how many lego sets he still has, we note that he sold all 13 lego sets. So, he still has 0 lego sets.

The final numerical answer is:
0"
"First, let's find out how many hours John runs in total in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the other two days, he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Now, let's add up the hours he runs each day:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total hours in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours:
Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, the final numerical answer is:
10"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how fast Dana can walk. We know that she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that skipping is half as fast as running. So, if skipping is 3 miles per hour, running must be twice that, which is 6 miles per hour. 

2. Now, we know Dana can run at 6 miles per hour and walk at half the speed of running, which is 3 miles per hour.

3. The question tells us that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she runs for one-third of the time, she walks for two-thirds of the time. The total time is six hours.

4. So, if she runs for one-third of six hours, she runs for 2 hours. If she walks for two-thirds of six hours, she walks for 4 hours.

5. Now we can calculate how far she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

6. And how far she can walk in 4 hours at 3 miles per hour: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ miles/hour} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

7. To find out how many miles she can travel in total, we add the miles she runs and the miles she walks: \(12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles}\).

So, the final numerical answer is 24 miles."
"First, let's find out how old Ben's iPhone is. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone's age as follows:

1 year * 2 = 2 years

So, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone's age as follows:

2 years * 4 = 8 years

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So we calculate:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is 200 feet."
"Grandma Jones had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so she had a total of 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26 pieces."
"First, let's find out how many calories are left for the day. If your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you can still eat:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings and has 250 calories per serving. So, one serving of chips has:

250 calories

To find out how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bag by the number of servings:

300g ÷ 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can find out how many grams you can eat with 0.8 servings:

0.8 servings × 60g per serving = 48g

So, the final numerical answer is 48 grams."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (because 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds).

2. **Calculate the cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Since Charlie needs 2 pounds, the total cost is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - So, the total revenue from 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $20.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:**
   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday.
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   - Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
   - Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
   - Total hours = Total articles \(\times\) Hours per article
   - Total hours = 26 \(\times\) 4 = 104 hours.

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and had 23 left after using some for the coffee cups. This means she used 80 - 23 = 57 post-it notes for the coffee cups. Since she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

So, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is the number she used for the coffee cups, which is 220."
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of one blue tie:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. If the blue ties cost $40 each, then the cost of one red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of one red tie} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long.

To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building.

There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.

To find out how many units are unoccupied, we calculate 1/4 of the total number of units:
1/4 * 120 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens

Now, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. So, to find out how much he makes from selling 21 dozens each day, we multiply:

21 dozens * $2/dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"First, let's understand the question. Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour. That's 3 hours of travel. Then he travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it takes him to get back.

To find out how long it takes to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled to the destination. Since he traveled 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, he is traveling back at 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes him 5 hours to get back. Let's write the final answer:

5"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes.

He removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
So, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:
15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the two days.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires. Each truck tire repair costs $60.
  \[
  6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires. Each car tire repair costs $40.
  \[
  4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160
  \]
- Total revenue for Thursday:
  \[
  \$360 + \$160 = \$520
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires. Each car tire repair costs $40.
  \[
  12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480
  \]
- The mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- Total revenue for Friday:
  \[
  \$0 + \$480 = \$480
  \]

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
\[
\$520 - \$480 = \$40
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many kittens Patchy had. The problem states that Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we can calculate the number of Patchy's kittens as follows:

7 * 3 = 21

So, Patchy had 21 kittens.

Now, we know that Trixie had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together:

7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, then the number of bags she can fill is 28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to first calculate the total cost for one visit to the movies. 

The cost for one visit is:
- Ticket: $7
- Popcorn: $7

Total cost for one visit = $7 + $7 = $14

Now, Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total money he has by the cost of one visit.

Number of visits = $42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"First, we need to find out how much weight the boxes can add to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is:

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

1245 ÷ 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck is 83."

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 25 oranges in total.
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

To find out how many oranges are unripe, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Now, let's add up the oranges that are not good:
- 1 bad orange
- 5 unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

Total oranges that are not good:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."

"Let's break down the question step by step:

1. Marcy gets a pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
2. After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the value of her pension per year.
3. We need to calculate her pension after 30 years.

First, let's calculate her pension for the first 20 years:
- She gets $50,000 per year for 20 years.
- Total for 20 years = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

After 20 years, her pension changes to 5% of the value of her pension.
- Her pension value after 20 years = $1,000,000.
- 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

Now, for the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30), she gets $50,000 per year.

So, her total pension for 30 years is:
- First 20 years: $1,000,000.
- Next 10 years: $50,000 per year for 10 years = $50,000 * 10 = $500,000.

Adding these together:
- Total pension for 30 years = $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000.

Now, to find her annual pension after 30 years:
- She gets $1,500,000 over 30 years.
- Annual pension = $1,500,000 / 30 = $50,000.

So, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the monthly cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - So, the total cost for the first half of the year is \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the reduced monthly cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The company charges 10% less on the second half of the year.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the reduced monthly cost is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the total cost for the second half of the year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the second half of the year is \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the cost of the first half of the year to the cost of the second half of the year.
   - Total cost = \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to find out how many miles she can drive with the 12 gallons of gas her tank can hold.

Sophia used 4 gallons to fill up her tank again, so we can calculate how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas by dividing the miles she traveled by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now that we know she can drive 25 miles with each gallon of gas, we can calculate how many miles she can drive with the full 12 gallons of gas:

\[ \text{Total miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 300 miles."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does it.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, each time he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week he spends 3 hours * 3 times = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks. So, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final numerical answer is 36 hours."

"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. Since there are 140 rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

140 rubies * 2 = 280 emeralds

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 605 gems

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 605."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. If there are twice as many boys as girls and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is:

- Total money = money from brownies + money from cheesecakes
- Total money = 129 + 92 = $221.

So, the final numerical answer is 221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest. Each phone costs $150, so for five phones:

\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each phone. So, for five phones, the total interest is:

\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, we add the interest to the total cost of the phones to get the total amount Shiela needs to pay:

\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ 765 \div 3 = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Now, let's calculate how much Artie will make from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Now, let's add up all the money he will make:
$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, the final numerical answer is $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
2. The level below it (level 3) will have double the square footage of the top level, so it's 16 * 2 = 32.
3. The level below that (level 2) will have double the square footage of level 3, so it's 32 * 2 = 64.
4. The level below that (level 1) will have double the square footage of level 2, so it's 64 * 2 = 128.

Now we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 128
- Level 2: 64
- Level 3: 32
- Level 4: 16

To find the average, we add up all the square footages and divide by the number of levels:
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
240 / 4 = 60

The average square footage of a level is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day.
   - So, for 180 days, the puppy will need \(180 \times 1 = 180\) cups of dog food.

2. **After 180 days:**
   - The puppy will need 2 cups of dog food every day.
   - We need to find out how many days are left in a year after the first 180 days.
   - A year has 365 days, so after 180 days, there are \(365 - 180 = 185\) days left.

3. **Dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   - The puppy will need 2 cups of dog food every day for these 185 days.
   - So, for 185 days, the puppy will need \(185 \times 2 = 370\) cups of dog food.

4. **Total dog food needed in the first year:**
   - The total amount of dog food needed is the sum of the dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days.
   - So, the total is \(180 + 370 = 550\) cups of dog food.

5. **Number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag.
   - So, the number of bags needed is \(550 \div 110 = 5\).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

From point 2, we can find out how much David does:
- If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

From point 3, we can find out how much Raymond does:
- If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry and Raymond does half as much, then Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
- Raymond does 200 pounds.
- David does 100 pounds.
- The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is 100."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:**
   - Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers (because 18 ÷ 3 = 6).
   - So, the total cost is 6 × $2.50 = $15.00.

2. **Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:**
   - Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers (because 18 ÷ 2 = 9).
   - So, the total cost is 9 × $1.00 = $9.00.

3. **Determine the better price:**
   - The better price is the cheaper one, which is $9.00.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of buying 18 flowers at the higher price and the cost at the better price.
   - Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost is $100. A 30% discount means John pays 70% of the original cost because 100% - 30% = 70%. 

To find out how much John pays, we calculate 70% of $100:

\( 70\% \times 100 = 0.70 \times 100 = 70 \)

So, the cost after the discount is $70.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we know the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the two girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The original amount of water was 24 liters. So, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. So we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

4 times Grace's weight is: \( 4 \times 125 = 500 \) pounds.

Then, subtract 2 pounds: \( 500 - 2 = 498 \) pounds.

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\( 125 + 498 = 623 \) pounds.

The final combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many roses there are in total. Dan has 3 rose bushes and each has 25 roses. So we multiply:

3 bushes * 25 roses/bush = 75 roses

75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns

So the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is L.
2. According to the question, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is L + 8.
3. The total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost.
4. So, we can write the equation: L + (L + 8) = 22
5. Simplifying the equation: 2L + 8 = 22
6. Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14
7. Divide both sides by 2: L = 7
8. Now we know they lost 7 games.
9. To find out how many they won, we add 8 to the number of games they lost: 7 + 8 = 15

So, the number of games they won is 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he started vacationing when he was 23. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each of the next three vacations, he also has 11 quilt blocks each. So, for the next three vacations, he has 3 * 11 = 33 quilt blocks. Adding the quilt blocks from his first vacation, he has a total of 11 + 33 = 44 quilt blocks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\).

The final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out Sylvie's initial salary, which is $600.

The company increases her salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie just stayed for 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% after the first year.

To find 10% of $600, we calculate:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 600 = \frac{10}{100} \times 600 = 0.1 \times 600 = 60 \]

So, her salary after the first year will be:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \]

After the second year, her salary will increase by another 10% of $660:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 660 = 0.1 \times 660 = 66 \]

So, her salary after the second year will be:
\[ 660 + 66 = 726 \]

After the third year, her salary will increase by another 10% of $726:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 726 = 0.1 \times 726 = 72.6 \]

So, her salary after the third year will be:
\[ 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies.
2. Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write the equation: \( H + 10H = 88,000 \).
4. Simplifying the left side, we get \( 11H = 88,000 \).
5. To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11: \( H = \frac{88,000}{11} \).
6. Calculating the division, we get \( H = 8,000 \).

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"First, let's find out how many friends actually come to the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, 1/4 of 16 is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 friends don't come. That means:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

So, 12 friends come to the party. Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. Since 12 guests are coming, she needs:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

So, she needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"First, let's find out how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs and there are 20 adults, we multiply:

20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Next, let's find out how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs. With 5 children, we multiply:

5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the potato salad needed for the adults and the children:

200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has 4 pets and Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has as follows:

Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2
Marcia's pets = 4 + 2
Marcia's pets = 6

Now, we know Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate the number of pets Jan has:

Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets
Jan's pets = 3 * 6
Jan's pets = 18

Now we have the number of pets each person has:
- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 6 pets.
- Jan has 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add them all together:

Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets
Total pets = 4 + 6 + 18
Total pets = 28

So, the final numerical answer is 28."

"First, we need to find out how fast Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs it in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast he can now run, we need to calculate 10% of his old time and then subtract it from his old time.

10% of 40 seconds is:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's new time is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- The number of dogs is 60.
- There are two cats for every dog.
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

Let's calculate the number of cats:
- Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \).

Next, let's calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
- The combined number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:
- The number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
- Total number of pets = number of dogs + number of cats + number of rabbits
- Total number of pets = \( 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

Girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls

2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
Girls in girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80 girls

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Girls not in girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls

So, the final numerical answer is 40."

"First, let's understand the problem step by step:

1. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
2. When Freda cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, if she starts with 16 ounces, after cooking, she will have 16 / 2 = 8 ounces of sauce.
3. Freda's last batch made 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is half the volume of the original tomatoes, we need to find out how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes she used to make 32 ounces of sauce.

To find out how many 16 ounce cans she used, we divide the total sauce by the volume of sauce per can:
32 ounces of sauce / 8 ounces of sauce per can = 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

3. In the first 15 minutes, 20 cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and we know the total number of cars that drove through is 20. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that drove through minus the number that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 20 - 20 = 0.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Henry meant to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's say he made \( x \) cookies last year.
2. So, he wanted to make \( 2x \) cookies this year.
3. He actually made 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he made \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 \) cookies left.
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100

- They buy 10 gallons.

So, the total cost without cashback is:
\[ 3.00 \times 10 = 30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback:

- The cashback is $0.20 per gallon.
- They buy 10 gallons.

So, the total cashback is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount after cashback:

\[ 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00 \]

So, the final amount after the cashback rewards is:
\[ 28.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice had. She had 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. To find the total number, we multiply these two numbers:

2 (width) * 24 (length) = 48 roll-ups

Now, let's find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell had. He had 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. To find the total number, we multiply these two numbers:

3 (width) * 14 (length) = 42 roll-ups

Now we know that Beatrice ate 48 roll-ups and Marcell ate 42 roll-ups. To find the average, we add the total number of roll-ups they ate and then divide by 2 (since there are two people):

(48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's find out how many seconds it takes Julia to row one foot. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so:

\[ \text{Time to row one foot} = \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot} \]

Now, we know the shore is 64 seconds away. So, we can calculate how many feet she can row in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Feet rowed in 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{0.8 \text{ seconds per foot}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

16"
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day (once for each lesson). Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is:

2 times per teacher * 4 teachers = 8 times

Each time the whiteboard is used, it is cleaned 3 times. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:

8 times * 3 times cleaned per use = 24 times

The final numerical answer is 24."

"First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Jamal's phone capacity} = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs:

\[ 1800 = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide 1800 by 6:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). Then:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = 50 \times B \]

We already know Brittany's phone capacity is 300, so:

\[ 300 = 50 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we divide 300 by 50:

\[ B = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks (or birds) in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

She bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber at $10 each:
10 boards * $10/board = $100

She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber at $16 each:
5 boards * $16/board = $80

Now, let's add the total cost of both types of lumber:
$100 + $80 = $180

Since Sasha sells all the lumber, the total selling price would be the same as the total cost, which is $180.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
$180 (selling price) - $180 (cost) = $0

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. So, the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 parts (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined).

To find out how many parts of the total are teaspoons of sugar, we use the ratio of sugar parts. Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts out of 20, we can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar by the following:

\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 120 \]

Now, let's calculate this.
```python
# Given values
total_parts = 120
ratio_sugar = 7
ratio_water = 13

# Total ratio parts
total_ratio_parts = ratio_sugar + ratio_water

# Calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar
number_of_teaspoons_sugar = (ratio_sugar / total_ratio_parts) * total_parts
number_of_teaspoons_sugar
```
```output
42.0
```
The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he buys 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so he pays 6 * $60 = $360.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many vehicles were imported on the first day. We know that there were 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles inside. So, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles on the second day and the number of vehicles on the first day:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find out how many containers were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles per container:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
   \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary is \( L \), then:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

3. **Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

4. **Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

5. **Total salary four years later:**
   The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples Morisette brought: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges Morisette brought: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) oranges

Now, let's add up all the fruits they brought:
- Morisette's total: \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits
- Kael's total: \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits

So, the total number of fruits they have together is:
- Morisette's total + Kael's total: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

The final numerical answer is 27."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: Sadie slept 8 hours.
- Tuesday: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
- Wednesday: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
- Thursday and Friday: She slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday combined. 
  - Tuesday and Wednesday together: 6 + 4 = 10 hours.
  - So, Thursday and Friday: 10 + 1 = 11 hours each day.

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 11 hours
- Friday: 11 hours

"First, let's calculate how many miles Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.

10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can run at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

She has 7 hours in total and she has already used 3 hours, so she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left.

Now, let's calculate how many miles she can run in those 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, let's add the miles she ran at 10 miles per hour to the miles she ran at 5 miles per hour.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"First, let's find out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. She has 60 letters needing stamps and she puts stamps on one-third of them. 

One-third of 60 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. 

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile that are already stamped. 

To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we add the 20 letters she stamped to the 30 letters that were already stamped:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

So, when Jennie began, there were 50 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia originally had some spoons, but she was out of plastic ones.
2. She bought a new package of spoons.
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
5. After all this, Julia had 12 spoons in total.

To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to figure out how many spoons she had before using any and before her husband gave her the 5 spoons.

Let's call the number of spoons Julia originally had (before buying the new package) as \( x \).

After buying the new package, she had \( x + \text{(number of spoons in the package Julia bought)} \) spoons.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x + \text{(number of spoons in the package Julia bought)} + 5 \) spoons.

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \text{(number of spoons in the package Julia bought)} + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + \text{(number of spoons in the package Julia bought)} + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x + \text{(number of spoons in the package Julia bought)} = 10 \]

Since we don't know \( x \) (the number of spoons Julia originally had), we can't determine \( x \) directly. But we know that the number of spoons in the package Julia bought plus 2 equals 10. So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is:

\[ \text{(number of spoons in the package Julia bought)} = 10 - 2 = 8 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"

"First, let's find out how much each type of fruit costs.

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much Dillon will spend on each type of fruit:

- For watermelons: 4 watermelons at $45 each, so \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
- For peppers: 20 peppers at $15 each, so \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
- For oranges: 10 oranges at $40 each, so \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

\( 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the profit the hospital makes from the patients' visits. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the number of hours each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day is \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from the patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients.
   - So, the total revenue from the patients is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - So, the total cost to the hospital is \( 150 \times 200 = 30000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   - So, the profit is \( 40000 - 30000 = 10000 \) dollars.

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- So, for the roller coaster, Pam used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times.
- So, for the luge, Pam used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- In total, Pam used \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Now, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- So, for the roller coaster, Fred used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times.
- So, for the luge, Fred used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- In total, Fred used \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, let's add the tickets used by Pam and Fred:
- Pam used 24 tickets.

"First, let's find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 700 bees in total.
2. Let's say there are x baby bees.
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so there are 2x worker bees.
4. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so there are x/2 queens.

Now, let's add up all the bees:
Baby bees + Worker bees + Queens = Total bees
x + 2x + x/2 = 700

Combine like terms:
3.5x = 700

Now, solve for x:
x = 700 / 3.5
x = 200

So, there are 200 baby bees.

- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- So, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs:
- 2 bottles of bleach.
- 1 pack of cloths.

The cost of bleach per bottle is $2, and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for one client is:
- 2 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle = $4 for bleach.
- 1 pack of cloths * $5 per pack = $5 for cloths.
- Total cost for one client = $4 + $5 = $9.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for all 8 clients:
- Total cost for 8 clients = 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20.

So, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"First, let's find out how many pineapples John gets from his field in one harvest. Since he has 10 hectares and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest as follows:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year:

12 months / 3 months = 4 harvests in a year

Now, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

So, the final numerical answer is 4000 pineapples."
"First, let's find out how many pieces are in the second lego set. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which has 500 pieces. So, the second set has:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's find out how many pieces are in the third lego set. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which has 500 pieces. So, the third set has:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2125 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half as many bees as left in the first 6 hours return. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before this time return to the hive. So, all 60 bees that left in the previous 6 hours return.

Now, we need to find out how many bees returned in the last 6 hours. From the above, we know that 60 bees left in the previous 6 hours and all of them returned in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 60.

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"Brittany's mom gave the cashier $12 for the adult ticket and $10 for the child ticket. So, the total cost for both tickets is $12 + $10 = $22. Since she received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

The final numerical answer is:
30"
"First, let's find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, then:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{\text{Charlie's friends}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends."
"First, we need to convert miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now we calculate the time it takes for each to get home.

Time for Steve:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Time for Tim:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home.

The difference in time is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Shawnda charges 25 cents for each tire inflated.
2. On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
3. For these 10 tires, Shawnda would charge 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.
4. 3 people came with tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
5. For these 9 tires, Shawnda would charge 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.
6. One person came on a unicycle, but a unicycle has only 1 tire, so that's 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.
7. Now, let's add up all the charges: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.
8. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Carl has in total. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So we multiply:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to buy all these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the number of cookies by the cost per cookie:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the final numerical answer is $4.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries.

Let's work backwards to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

First, we know that after the raccoon ate, there were 5 fries left. Before the raccoon ate, there were 5 * (3/2) = 7.5 fries. Since we can't have half a fry, let's assume the raccoon ate 7 fries (rounding down because you can't eat half a fry).

So, before the raccoon ate, there were 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 fries. Again, rounding down, we have 14 fries.

Before the pigeons ate, there were 14 + 9 = 23 fries.

Before the seagull ate, there were 23 + 7 = 30 fries.

Before Dave ate, there were 30 + 14 = 44 fries.

So, the pack had 44 fries when Dave bought it."
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- So, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours for these days in one week is:
\[3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- So, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours for these days in one week is:
\[2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, we add the hours from both types of days to get the total hours Kimo spends in class in one week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, the total hours Kimo spends in class in one semester is:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[272\]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

For the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- So, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

For the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- So, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

For the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- So, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
- Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
- Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months.

The total number of bananas needed for 2 months is:
700 (bananas per month) * 2 (months) = 1400 bananas.

So, the final numerical answer is 1400 bananas."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, for each round trip, he runs 100 yards forward and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards. Since he does this 15 times, the total distance he runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards for each round trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens:
- He bought 4 pens.
- Each pen costs $1.5.
- So, the total cost for the pens is \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- He bought 2 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $4.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

Then, let's consider the cost of the rim of bond paper:
- The rim of bond paper costs $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of pens: $6
- Cost of notebooks: $8
- Cost of bond paper: $20

So, the total amount Raphael spent is \( 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
34"
"Finn originally saw 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more came out, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 hid, so we subtract those: 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.
2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than on Monday. So, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's find out how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Next, let's find out how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Now, let's find out how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now we can add up all the fish they caught together:

Anakin's fish: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish
Locsin's fish: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Total fish caught by both: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out how much the price increases every two months. The original price is $20. A 20% increase on $20 is calculated as follows:

\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

So, the price increases by $4 every two months. 

Now, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months. Each time the price increases by $4, we can calculate the new price. The price after each increase can be calculated by adding $4 to the previous price. 

Let's calculate the price after each increase:

- After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24
- After 4 months: $24 + $4 = $28
- After 6 months: $28 + $4 = $32
- And so on...

We can see that the price after 36 months will be:

\[ 20 + (18 \times 4) = 20 + 72 = 92 \]

So, the final price of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92."
"First, let's find out how much one red car costs. We know that one red car costs $4.

Next, we need to find out how much three action figures cost. Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures would cost:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

We are told that the doll costs as much as three action figures. So, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = 5 \times 4 = 20 dollars
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = 3 \times 5 = 15 dollars
- Doll: $15

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's understand the problem. Jackie can do freelance work and earn $35 per hour. If she does her own taxes, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. So, the missed income is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

If Jackie hires an accountant, she won't lose any income. The accountant charges $90. So, the missed income if she does her own taxes is $105, and the cost of hiring an accountant is $90. The difference between the missed income and the cost of hiring an accountant is:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant. The final numerical answer is:

\$15"
"First, let's add up the cost of all the computer accessories Elvira bought:
- Screen, keyboard and mouse: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:
1500 - 1423 = 77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to figure out how many eggs she needs for 15 flans and then see how many times she needs to get eggs from her neighbor.

Each flan needs 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time:
\[ 45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs/babysitting} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
3. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
4. In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).
5. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]
7. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]
9. Now we know Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is:
   \[
   2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's find out how much money Jimmy has.

We know that Ethel has $8. According to the question, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.

So, we calculate twice the money Ethel has:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we add $2 to this amount to find out how much Jimmy has:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add up the miles he walks on weekdays and the miles he walks on weekends.

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends together:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"First, let's find out how much the jacket costs. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, and the hat costs $25. So, the jacket costs:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the pants cost. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated by adding the cost of the hat and the jacket, and then dividing by 2:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we can find the total cost of one uniform by adding the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[ 150 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs for the spiders is:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs for the insects is:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

Then, let's calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates and each invertebrate has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs for the invertebrates is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we add up all the legs from the spiders, insects, and invertebrates to get the total number of legs Jake sees:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's figure out the ages of the birds step by step.

1. We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now we have the ages of all the birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages together:
19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's find out the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Now, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find out how much 50% more is, we calculate:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, 50% more than the minimum is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Billy to peel one potato and how long it takes to cut one potato. 

Peeling one potato takes 1.5 minutes.
Cutting one potato takes 5 seconds.

To make it easier to compare, let's convert everything to the same unit. We'll use seconds.

1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Billy has 60 potatoes to do this for. So, we multiply the time it takes for one potato by the number of potatoes:

95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

To find out how long this is in minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

5700 seconds ÷ 60 = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate how much they earn from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total earnings per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

They made a profit of $25. Profit is calculated as total earnings minus the cost. Let's denote the cost of making one gallon of lemonade as \( C \). The cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar. We know the cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so:
\[ C = \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - \$5 \]
\[ \$25 = \$5 \]

This means the total earnings of $10 per gallon is the profit plus the cost. So, the cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $5. The cost of lemons is $3. Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ \$3 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese

We are told that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

160 Chinese - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and how much is left after these expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

1. Rent: 1/4 of his salary
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Car fuel: 1/3 of his salary
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after spending on rent and car fuel.
\[
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

After donating to charity, the remaining amount is:
\[
2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
\[
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is 350$.

"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Next, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of crabs the three have together. We add the number of crabs each of them has:

\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[ 40 + 36 = 76 \]
\[ 76 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"First, let's find out how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the votes. If the total number of votes is 80, then:

Votes for the winner = 3/4 * 80

Let's calculate this.
3/4 of 80 is 60. So, the winner got 60 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got would be the total votes minus the votes the winner got:

Votes for the loser = Total votes - Votes for the winner
Votes for the loser = 80 - 60

Now, let's calculate this.
80 - 60 = 20

So, the loser got 20 votes. The final numerical answer is:

20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of white carnations Sandra ordered is \( x \).

2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is \( 4x \).

3. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. So, \( 5x = 200 \).

4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation \( 5x = 200 \):
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]

5. Now that we know \( x = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
   \[
   4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
160"
"First, let's find out how old Mark is. We know that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

According to the question, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, two years ago, half of Jan's age was 28 / 2 = 14 years. Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

To find out Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the faster team to complete the race.

Each member of the faster team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the faster team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for the slower team to complete the race.

The first runner of the slower team takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take 51 seconds.

Now, let's add up the times for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now we need to find out how many seconds the faster team wins by:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in their probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 3 cages of rats, and we need to find out how many rats are in each cage.
3. Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
4. There are 10 cages of hamsters.
5. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
6. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw are used for the hamsters and the rabbits:

- For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces
- For the rabbits: 20 pieces

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total:

- Total straw - straw for hamsters - straw for rabbits = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces

These 90 pieces are for the rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats, we divide the straw for rats by the number of cages:

- 90 pieces / 3 cages = 30 pieces per cage

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find out how many rats are in each cage by dividing the straw per cage by the straw per rat:

- 30 pieces per cage / 6 pieces per rat = 5 rats per cage

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mandy owes Benedict $100.
2. They agreed to have a monthly interest of 2%. So, the interest for one month is 2% of $100, which is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
3. After 3 months, the total interest would be 3 * $2 = $6.
4. So, the total amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months is the original amount plus the interest: $100 + $6 = $106.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The trader buys some bags of wheat at $20 per bag.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. The trader sells all the bags at $30 each.
4. The trader made a total profit of $400.

First, let's find out the total cost for one bag including the cost of buying and transporting it:
- Cost of buying one bag = $20
- Cost of transporting one bag = $2
- Total cost for one bag = $20 + $2 = $22

Next, let's find out the profit made from selling one bag:
- Selling price of one bag = $30
- Cost of one bag = $22
- Profit from selling one bag = $30 - $22 = $8

Now, let's find out how many bags the trader sold to make a total profit of $400:
- Profit per bag = $8
- Total profit = $400
- Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag = $400 / $8 = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. They spent $20.25 on tickets, so:

\[ \text{Food cost} = \text{Ticket cost} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, let's add up all the costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Ticket cost} + \text{Food cost} + \text{Ride cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 2 \times 33 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 102 \]

Now, they agreed to split all the costs evenly among the three friends. So, each friend pays:

\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{3} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid $34."

"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that the ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each week.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so we need to divide the weekly amount by 7 to find out how much they need each day.
3. So, we do the calculation: 3.5 pounds ÷ 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day.

The final numerical answer is 0.5 pounds."
"Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees would be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. So, after 10 years, without any trees dying, he would have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. Therefore, the number of trees left after 10 years is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final numerical answer is 91 trees."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

3. **The neighbors painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back:**
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos.

4. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)

5. **Number of white flamingos:**

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of Pokemon cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **After the first month**:
   - She collected three times the number she initially had.
   - So, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
   - Total cards after the first month: \(20 + 60 = 80\).

3. **After the second month**:
   - She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   - So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
   - Total cards after the second month: \(80 + 40 = 120\).

4. **After the third month**:
   - She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   - The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\).
   - So, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

"Let's break down the problem into smaller parts to solve it step by step.

### First Part:
Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks.

1. **Calculate the distance he rode in one week:**
   - He rode 5 times a week.
   - Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
   - So, in one week, he rode \( 5 \times 25 = 125 \) kilometers.

2. **Calculate the distance he rode in 4 weeks:**
   - He rode 125 kilometers each week.
   - He rode for 4 weeks.
   - So, in 4 weeks, he rode \( 125 \times 4 = 500 \) kilometers.

### Second Part:
After 4 weeks, he decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks.

1. **Calculate the distance he rode in one week:**
   - He rode 2 times a week.
   - Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
   - So, in one week, he rode \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) kilometers.

2. **Calculate the distance he rode in 3 weeks:**
   - He rode 120 kilometers each week.
   - He rode for 3 weeks.
   - So, in 3 weeks, he rode \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \) kilometers.

### Total Distance:
Now, we add the distances from both parts to get the total distance Micheal rode.

- Distance in the first 4 weeks: 500 kilometers.
- Distance in the next 3 weeks: 360 kilometers.

So, the total distance is \( 500 + 360 = 860 \) kilometers.

"First, let's break down the question into smaller parts to understand it better.

1. **Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.**
   - A dozen is 12, so twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than $36000, so it is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.
   - The total cost of 240 cups is $34800.
   - To find the cost of each cup, we divide $34800 by 240.

Let's do the division:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and Sara wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.

So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Sara also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after babysitting.

The remaining money Sara needs to earn is $70 - $10 (what she already had) - $20 (what she earns from babysitting) = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40. This is calculated by dividing the remaining money by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens.
2. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens.
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens produce \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.
5. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks around the park. The park is a rectangle, so the distance around it (the perimeter) is calculated by adding up all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to add the number of customers from the first and second days to the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) + (total by third day - 100 - 150) = 500

Now, let's calculate:
100 + 150 = 250
500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the small pool has \( x \) gallons of water now.
2. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, the big pool has \( 4x \) gallons of water now.
3. 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( x - 4 \times 4 = x - 16 \) gallons of water.
4. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 4x - 4 \times 4 = 4x - 16 \) gallons of water.
5. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, \( 4x - 16 = 2(x - 16) \).

Now, let's solve the equation \( 4x - 16 = 2(x - 16) \):

\[
4x - 16 = 2x - 32
\]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

\[
2x - 16 = -32
\]

Add 16 to both sides:

\[
2x = -16 + 16
\]

\[
2x = 0
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
x = 0
\]

So, the small pool has 0 gallons of water now.

The final numerical answer is:
0"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44.00 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"First, let's find out how much Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus 10% of that amount. 

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 2000 \times \frac{10}{100} = 2000 \times 0.1 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase.

"First, let's find out the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

Next, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years}}{3}
\]
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
45

"First, let's find out how many points each student scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Then Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

The final numerical answer is 54."

"First, let's find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used some for her garden.

The tank originally has 120 liters of water.
Celine used 90 liters for her garden.

So, the water left in the tank is:
120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank.

The amount left in the tank is 30 liters, so the rainwater collected is:
2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank to find out the total amount of water in the tank now.

Total water in the tank now is:
30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the final numerical answer is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. To find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.

The final numerical answer is 140."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year.
2. For the second year, they spent a third of $15000 on advertising. 
   - A third of $15000 is calculated as $15000 / 3 = $5000.
3. Now, we add the amounts spent in both years:
   - First year: $15000
   - Second year: $5000
   - Total: $15000 + $5000 = $20000

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, let's calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. He rents it for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
Carlos pays $90 for renting the canoe.

Next, let's calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. He rents it for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
Benji pays $90 for renting the banana boat raft.

Now, to find out how much they pay altogether, we add the amounts Carlos and Benji pay:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total amount they pay for their rentals is:
\[ 180 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
- It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester, which means it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days by car.

Now, Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car. So, we need to add the days for the trip by bus and the trip by car.

- Bus trip: 6 days
- Car trip: 3 days

Adding these together: 6 + 3 = 9 days

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

He starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left = 40 - 8 = 32

He buys 14 more grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now = 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
- Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card is a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"First, let's add up all the costs of the burrito and the extra items Chad ordered:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Chad also decided to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, so we add that to the total:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add together in one minute.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can add \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can add \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add together in one minute:

\( \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. We know that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready. 

To find 30% of 120, we can do:
\[ 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. This means the number of watermelons left after the first harvest is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, Ashlyn came back two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many of these were ready, we calculate:
\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the second two weeks. This means the number of watermelons left after the second harvest is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ 21 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration.

Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.
So, the total cost of the cars is:
12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000

Next, Mark has to pay 10% tax on the cars. To find out how much the tax is, we calculate 10% of $240,000:
10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars:
$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Then, Mark has to pay $1000 for registration on each car. So, the total registration cost is:
12 cars * $1000/car = $12,000

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost of the cars and tax:
$264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27 candies

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to the number of candies Robert has.

James's candies = Robert's candies + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 candies

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike was pen pals with 5 people initially.
2. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people now.
3. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long.
4. So, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week.
5. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all 3 people is 3 * 10 = 30 pages a week.
6. Mike responds in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week.
7. In total, Mike sends 30 pages to others and 30 pages back, which is 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.
8. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
9. So, for 60 pages, he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.
10. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 360 minutes is 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final numerical answer is 6 hours."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries. So, Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 5 * 2 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
5. After all this, Griffin ends up with 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to see how many more fries Griffin had at the end. Griffin had 27 fries at the end, and she had 7 fries after all the others took some. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"First, let's find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums:

4 snails - 32 snails = -28 snails

The difference is -28 snails, which means there are 28 fewer snails in the first aquarium than in the second aquarium.

Now, we know that this difference (28 snails) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium ""F"". So we have:

28 snails = 2 * (F + F)  (since both aquariums have the same number of fish)

28 snails = 2 * 2F
28 snails = 4F

Now, we solve for F:

F = 28 snails / 4
F = 7 snails

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"First, let's calculate how many hours the makeup artist works in one week. She needs the makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time, so:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/time} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours she works in 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, she gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30000:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 30000 = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean paid:

\[ 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is 27000."

Let's add these amounts together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies.

Isabelle is splitting this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost is being divided among three people (Isabelle and her two parents).

To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person pays $32.

The final numerical answer is:

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)
Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, let's calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

Sue's calories - Her sister's calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

The final numerical answer is 5600 calories."
"First, let's find out how many students are in the school in total.

Each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, so:
20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so:
50% of 60 students = 0.50 * 60 = 30 boys
50% of 60 students = 0.50 * 60 = 30 girls

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the first and second classes.

The first class has 15 girls.
The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
15 girls + 12 girls = 27 girls

Since the school has 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 27 girls = 3 girls

Since each class has 20 students, and we know there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is:
20 students - 3 girls = 17 boys

So, the final numerical answer is:
17"
"Travis started with 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so he had:

The final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
2. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's find out how many wolves and cougars Rick killed today.

- Let's say Rick killed \( x \) cougars today.
- Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, he killed \( 3x \) wolves.
- We know from the problem that today he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. The previous night he killed 15 cougars, so today he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.
- Therefore, \( x = 12 \).

Now we can find out how many wolves he killed:
- Since he killed \( 3x \) wolves, and \( x = 12 \), he killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now we can calculate the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.
- Total: 25 + 48 = 73 animals.

So, the final numerical answer is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. 

To find the floor he rides to, we multiply his starting floor by 4 and then add 6:

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. Mitchel went down 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel. 

To find 30% of 30, we calculate:
\[ 30 \times \frac{30}{100} = 30 \times 0.3 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down 9 less times than Mitchel. Therefore, Anne went down:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Now, Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cows are in each of the 20 stalls before Mr. Sylas buys more cows. There are 10 stalls and each has 20 cows:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Now, he has a total of:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

He divides these 40 new cows equally into the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then add them all together.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[

So, Brady has **45 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to find out how many sections the redwood tree has. Since each section is 10 feet and the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide the total height by the length of each section:

200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the whole tree before the termites ate is:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so we need to find out how much 30% of 8000 pounds is:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight the termites ate from the original weight to find out how much the tree weighs now:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds."
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost for the overdue books and add the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 8 books:
- Each book costs $0.50.
- So, for 8 books, the cost is \( 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \) dollars.

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the books to the flat fee:
- Total cost = Cost of books + Flat fee
- Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
5. Now, let's add up all the fruits:
   - Andrea's apples: 52
   - Andrea's bananas: 24
   - Jamal's apples: 44
   - Jamal's bananas: 48

   Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many cookies Carla is making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so:
   \[
   36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. So, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
   \]

3. To find \(x\), we can cross-multiply and solve:
   \[
   2 \times 66 = 12 \times x
   \]
   \[
   132 = 12x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{132}{12} = 11

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, let's find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup. 

There are 9,300 pennies in the cup. To find two thirds of 9,300, we can do the following calculation:

1. Find one third of 9,300 by dividing 9,300 by 3.
2. Then, multiply the result by 2 to get two thirds.

Let's do the division first:
9,300 ÷ 3 = 3,100

Now, multiply 3,100 by 2 to get two thirds:
3,100 × 2 = 6,200

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since 100 pennies make a dollar, we can find the dollar amount by dividing the number of pennies by 100:
6,200 ÷ 100 = 62

The final numerical answer is 62 dollars."
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.

"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

Ferdinand's trees = Chris's trees / 2
Ferdinand's trees = 6 / 2
Ferdinand's trees = 3

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:

Harry's trees = 2 * Ferdinand's trees + 5
Harry's trees = 2 * 3 + 5
Harry's trees = 6 + 5
Harry's trees = 11

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

More trees = Harry's trees - Ferdinand's trees
More trees = 11 - 3
More trees = 8

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is 8."

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400

So, the final numerical answer is 400."
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000:
\[ 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000:
\[ 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the question step by step.

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - So, it takes \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to heat the oil.
   - Time to cook is \( 28 - 5 = 23 \) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Total time = Time to heat to 300 degrees + Time to heat to 400 degrees + Time to cook.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches of the body, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the remaining stitches are for the sleeves:
1800 (total) - 1170 (body, collar, rosette) = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

The final numerical answer is:
315"

"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step:

1. We know that the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20.
2. This means if we add their ages together, we get 20.
3. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
4. So, if we add 10 years to each of their current ages, their total age will increase by 20 years (10 years for Mico + 10 years for Marco).

Now, let's calculate the sum of their ages in 10 years:

- Their current total age is 20.
- In 10 years, their total age will be 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
2. Then Ruby's current age is \( 6S \) because Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
3. In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
4. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).
5. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

6. Now let's solve this equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27

   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Determine the length of each sterling silver bead:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.

4. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Total remaining length for beads = 17 inches.
   - Length of each bead = 1/4 inch.
   - Number of beads = Total remaining length / Length of each bead = 17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 * 4 = 68 beads.

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ stories} \]

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled that number:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ stories} \]

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ stories} \]

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the first week and the second week.

Alani's total:
\[ 20 \text{ (first week)} + 40 \text{ (second week)} = 60 \text{ stories} \]

Braylen's total:
\[ 40 \text{ (first week)} + 80 \text{ (second week)} = 120 \text{ stories} \]

Margot's total:
\[ 60 \text{ (first week)} + 120 \text{ (second week)} = 180 \text{ stories} \]

Finally, let's add up all the stories they wrote altogether:
\[ 60 \text{ (Alani)} + 120 \text{ (Braylen)} + 180 \text{ (Margot)} = 360 \text{ stories} \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters are worth 5 * 25 = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes are worth 2 * 10 = 20 cents. In total, Kelly has 125 + 20 = 145 cents. She buys a can of pop for 55 cents. So, the amount of cents she will have left is 145 - 55 = 90 cents. 

The final numerical answer is 90."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know the flag has 76 stars in total.
2. It has three rows of 8 stars each. So, 3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars.
3. It also has two rows of 6 stars each. So, 2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars.
4. Now, we subtract the stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars: 76 total stars - 24 stars (from rows of 8) - 12 stars (from rows of 6) = 40 stars.
5. The rest of the stars are in rows of 5. So, we divide the remaining stars by 5 to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are: 40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a slower speed (30 miles/hour), we can find the time it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
Izzy's medals = 22 - 5
Izzy's medals = 17

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

Total medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals = 22 + 17
Total medals = 39

The problem states that Ali and Izzy together have 10 times less medals than have been given out. This means the total number of medals they have is 1/10 of the total medals given out. So, if we let the total medals given out be \( x \), we have:

39 = \( \frac{x}{10} \)

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 10:

\( x = 39 \times 10 \)
\( x = 390 \)

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.
- So, the total number of chocolate bars is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) chocolate bars.

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars the adults get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) chocolate bars.

Now, let's find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The adults get 24 chocolate bars.
- So, the children get \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) chocolate bars.

Finally, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 16 chocolate bars left.
- There are 8 children.
- So, each child gets \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \) chocolate bars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

She pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes. So, the total time she works is 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, for 15 intervals, she earns 15 * $5 = $75.

So, the final numerical answer is $75."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Mike's points:**
   - Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.

2. **Determine Jim's points:**
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - So, Jim's points = Mike's points - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18 points.

3. **Determine Tony's points:**
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
   - So, Tony's points = 2 * Mike's points = 2 * 21 = 42 points.

4. **Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

5. **Calculate the total points after the extra points are distributed:**
   - Mike's total points = 21 points.
   - Jim's total points = 18 points.
   - Tony's total points = 42 points + 1 extra point = 43 points.

6. **Sum up the total points of all three players:**
   - Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
   - Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82 points.

So, the final numerical answer is 82."

First, let's find out how many pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses Darren did on the second day.

On the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

On the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity he did in two days.

Total pushups:
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total: 100 + 120 = 220

Total squats:
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total: 50 + 40 = 90

Total dumbbell presses:
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, let's add up all the activities to get the total count.

Total count of activities:
- Pushups: 220

"First, let's find out how much rice the family eats in one meal. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the family, the total rice consumed per meal is:

0.2 kg/person * 5 persons = 1 kg/meal

Now, let's find out how much rice they eat in one day. They eat rice at lunch and dinner, so:

1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day

Next, we need to find out how much rice they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the amount consumed per week:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

So, the final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate how many days Sam actually worked in the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he worked on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Now, let's add up the crates he sold during the days he worked:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) + 20 crates (weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each person bids $50 more than the last person.
3. There are 3 other people bidding.

- The first person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
- The second person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
- The third person bids $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of these 3 people. So, she bids:
- After the first person: $250 + $50 = $300.
- After the second person: $300 + $50 = $350.
- After the third person: $350 + $50 = $400.

Carmen wins the auction with her last bid of $400.

So, the final amount of money the desk costs her is $400."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. So, he drives 60 miles each day.

He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives:
60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week

He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives:
300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven.

He is charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is:
15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus he gives the driver per year.

The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is:
$150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Now, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year.

Total cost = Cost of miles + Bonus
Total cost = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

So, John pays $31,800 a year for driving."
"First, let's find out how much time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. So we need to multiply 39 by 2:
39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 78."
"To solve this problem, let's think about how many pages we can make with one piece of paper. 

When we fold a piece of paper vertically, we get two pages on the front and back. So, one piece of paper can make 2 pages.

A 32-page tabloid means we need 32 pages in total.

Since each piece of paper makes 2 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

So, we do the calculation:
32 pages ÷ 2 pages per piece of paper = 16 pieces of paper

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Now, to find out how much money is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, Annika has $15 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total books**: Elise's Dad has 250 books.
2. **Unsold books**: There are 50 unsold books.
3. **Total sold books**: 250 books - 50 unsold books = 200 books sold.
4. **Books sold this year**: 45 books.
5. **Books sold in the first year**: Twice as many as this year, so 2 * 45 = 90 books.
6. **Books sold in the second year**: We need to find this out.

To find the books sold in the second year, we subtract the books sold in the first and this year from the total books sold:
200 books (total sold) - 90 books (first year) - 45 books (this year) = 65 books (second year).

Now, each book sells for $20, so the total money earned in the second year is:
65 books * $20/book = $1300.

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is $1300."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate how many hours Watson works in a week:
   - He works 10 hours a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - So, 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

2. Next, calculate how much he earns in a week:
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

3. Now, add the bonus he gets each week:
   - He gets a $300 bonus each week.
   - So, $500/week + $300/week = $800/week.

4. Finally, calculate how much he earns in April:
   - April has 30 days.
   - He works 4 weeks in April (since 30 days / 7 days/week = 4.285 weeks, we round down to 4 weeks).
   - So, 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200.

Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."

"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Weight Sandy loses per week} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

We need to find the number of weeks \( W \) it takes for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times W \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

To find \( W \), we divide 8 pounds by 2 pounds per week:

\[ W = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days.
2. The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days.
3. We need to find out how many times the person grows an extra arm and an extra leg in 15 days.

First, let's find out how many times the person grows an extra arm in 15 days:
- In 15 days, the person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- So, in 15 days, the person grows an extra arm \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) times.

Next, let's find out how many times the person grows an extra leg in 15 days:
- In 15 days, the person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- So, in 15 days, the person grows an extra leg \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) times.

Now, we need to find out how many new limbs the person grows in total:
- The person grows 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- So, the total cost for the business suits is \( 6 \times 100 = $600 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- So, the total cost for the suitcases is \( 3 \times 50 = $150 \).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100, so 5 times the cost of a business suit is \( 5 \times 100 = $500 \).
- Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is \( 500 + 700 = $1200 \).

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of business suits: $600
- Cost of suitcases: $150
- Cost of flight ticket: $1200
- Total cost: \( 600 + 150 + 1200 = $1950 \).

Theo has $6000 to spend and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the amount he can spend is:
- Total money - Savings = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items he has already bought from the amount he can spend:
- Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total cost of items = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's find out how many eggs the three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume in a day. 

3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

Next, let's find out how many eggs the two people who eat 2 eggs each day consume in a day.

2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

Now, let's add the number of eggs the two groups consume in a day.

9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

This is the total number of eggs the family consumes in a day. To find out how many eggs they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

30 - 3 = 27

Jane is 27 years old.

Now, since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:

27 + 5 = 32

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Calculate Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The final numerical answer is 120000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. Then the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (twice as many as on the defense).
3. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So we have:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve this, we need to find a common denominator for the terms involving \( D \):

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, to find \( D \), we can multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final numerical answer is:

- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Adding these together, Martha invited \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract these 8 people from the total invited:

- \(24 - 8 = 16\) people are expected to come.

Now, we are told that 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:

- \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Since these 2 people are already subtracted from the 8 who couldn't come, we don't need to subtract them again. Therefore, the number of people who actually show up for the party is:

- \(16\) people.

So, the final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
   - Marbles from Johanna: 20
   - Marbles from his father: 8
   - Marbles already in the store: 50
   - Total marbles: \( 20 + 8 + 50 = 78 \)
5. Each marble weighs 2 kgs. So, the total weight of the marbles is \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kgs.

The final numerical answer is 156 kgs."
"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height.

The pool's dimensions are:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

So, the volume is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.1 per cubic foot.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 120 \text{ cubic feet} \times 0.1 \text{ dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are in the classroom. If there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, then:

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Next, we need to find out how many nongendered children there are. The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

So, the final numerical answer is 123."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many electric poles are needed if the number of electric wires is 45 and the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3.

Given the ratio 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. So, if there are 45 wires, we can find out how many poles there are by dividing the number of wires by 3.

Let's calculate:
45 wires ÷ 3 = 15 poles

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, let's find out the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
- There were 25 men and 15 women.
- So, the total number of people was 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left:
- 1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since 10 people in total left, and 22 men stayed, this means 22 men + some women = 40 people in total.
- So, the number of women who left is 40 - 22 = 18 women.

Since there were originally 15 women at the party, and 18 women left, but only 15 women were there to begin with, it means all the women who left were the ones who were originally there.
- Therefore, the number of women left is 15 - 15 = 0 women.

The final numerical answer is:
0"
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the book costs $4 and the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{\text{Cost of book}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The final numerical answer is:

1"
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils.

So, if we let the number of pencils in each box be \( x \), then:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we need to add their total number of pencils:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cooling the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide the total cooling needed by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening due to ice cubes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Adding Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink.
   - However, the question asks how much weaker the coffee is, not how much stronger the drink is.

So, the total weakening of the coffee is just due to the ice cubes, which is 60 milliliters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Each person gets 7 new records, and they get this by trading 2 old records for 1 new one. So, for each new record, 2 old records are traded.

If 7 new records are traded, then:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much each senior programmer is paid. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so:

\[ \text{Senior programmer's pay} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total amount paid to junior programmers and the total amount paid to senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down (which means they left the bus), and 8 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop, we get:
   \[
   (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6
   \]

5. According to the problem, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. This means that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

6. To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school. So, he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends. So, he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.
5. After buying, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night. So, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning. So, he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"First, we need to find out how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100%. Since the phone is at 60% charged, it needs to be charged by 40% more.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points, it will take:
40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, the phone will take 2 hours to fully charge.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and gets 10 more, so she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then she gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate how many rewards the customer gets for spending $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80, they get:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off, so they get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, the customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. They used their $4 rewards, so the price after using the rewards is:

\[ 43 - 4 = 39 \]

Then, they used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they used 4 rewards, the coupon took off:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final price after applying the coupon is:

\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate on the net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job. The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8400 \]"
"First, let's find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins.

To find 40 percent of 220, we can do the following calculation:
\[ 40\% \times 220 = \frac{40}{100} \times 220 = 0.4 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

To find half of 88, we do the following calculation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44 \]

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, to find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's find out how many paintball guns they have in total. We add up the number of guns each person has:

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns.

So, the total number of guns is:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

So, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much sugar is needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar, 8 batches will need:
   30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

2. Next, we need to find out how much sugar is needed for 1 batch of fudge. One batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.

3. Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
   240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Maria's shares when she buys them. She buys 8 shares at $8 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase:

\[
\text{Increase} = 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{New price per share} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $12 each:

\[
\text{Value after first year} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ dollars}
\]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease:

\[
\text{Decrease} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{New price per share} = 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $9 each:

\[
\text{Value after second year} = 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[
\boxed{72}

"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate:

Thomas's hot dogs = 3 * Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 * 2
Thomas's hot dogs = 6

Now, let's find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:

John's hot dogs = 1/2 * Thomas's hot dogs
John's hot dogs = 1/2 * 6
John's hot dogs = 3

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

More hot dogs John ate than Luke = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs
More hot dogs John ate than Luke = 3 - 2
More hot dogs John ate than Luke = 1

So, the final numerical answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the total number of students is 200.
2. The class is split into 3 groups: 2 groups are equal in number, and the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups.
3. Let's say the number of students in each of the two equal groups is \( x \).
4. Then the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of students:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know that the total number of animals is 60:
     \[
     C + H = 60
     \]
   - We also know that there are twice as many chickens as cows:
     \[
     H = 2C
     \]

3. **Solve for the Number of Cows and Chickens:**
   - Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
     \[
     C + 2C = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3C = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Now, find \( H \) using \( H = 2C \):
     \[
     H = 2 \times 20 = 40

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**
   - Chickens have 2 legs each:
     \[
     \text{Total legs of chickens} = 40 \times 2 = 80
     \]
   - Cows have 4 legs each:
     \[
     \text{Total legs of cows} = 20 \times 4 = 80
     \]
   - Add the legs of chickens and cows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 = 160

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

So, Josh starts juggling on stage with 4 balls."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of one of each animal = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

"First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs if he follows his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. 

1/5 times more means he runs 1/5 more plus the original amount. So, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters to find out the new distance Tyson runs each day:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Tyson trains for a month in June, which has 30 days. So, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:

Now, Davos got a 40% discount on these shirts. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 60 = \frac{40}{100} \times 60 = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the discount is $24.

To find out how much Davos paid after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money they made per day when they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor made $100.

So, the total money made per day from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Now, let's calculate how much money they make per day now that they make silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo makes $220.

So, the total money made per day from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

To find out what percentage more they are making now, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New amount} - \text{Old amount}}{\text{Old amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the cost for each category (food, treats, and medicine) and then add them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the cost of food per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, the cost of treats per month is given as $20.

The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Now, let's add up the monthly costs:
- Cost of food per month: $100
- Cost of treats per month: $20
- Cost of medicine per month: $100
- Total monthly cost: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- Yearly cost: $220 * 12 = $2640.

So, the final numerical answer is:
2640"
"Let's break down the activities one by one:

1. **Monday**: Yoga class - 1 hour
2. **Tuesday**: Cooking class - 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. **Wednesday**: Cheese-tasting event - 0.5 hours
4. **Thursday**: Museum tour - half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. **Friday**: Errands - 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, she needs:

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses} \]

Now, let's add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses together:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots she needs from the number she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots left over} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount she spent is $11 (sweater) + $4 (brother) = $15.

Now, to find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she started with:

$36 (starting amount) - $15 (spent) = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is:
21"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: half of boating time, so 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 + 3 = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Now, we know that the 9 hours of boating and swimming, plus the 6 hours of watching shows, is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's find out the total time he spent on all activities.

Let's call the total time he spent on all activities ""T"". So, 30% of T is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.
This means 0.30 * T = 15 hours
To find T, we divide both sides by 0.30:
T = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of the total time (T) was spent sightseeing. So, we calculate 40% of 50 hours:
40% of 50 hours = 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

Now, let's add the money she earns from both jobs:

\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \]

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. So, let's add that to the money she earned from her jobs:

\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \]

So, Annabelle still needs $45 to save for the phone."
"First, let's find the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet tall. So, the second tree is:
6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, let's find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. So, the height of the tallest tree is:
2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final numerical answer is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars and each one costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
6 toy cars * $2/toy car = $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears and each one costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 teddy bears * $1/teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find out how much Dean spent in total:
$12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17

Dean's mother gave him $28 initially. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:
$28 - $17 = $11

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, we add this to the $11 Dean has left:
$11 + $10 = $21

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is $21."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts.

- The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
- The cost for two rides on the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, let's subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens.

- The budget is $90.
- The cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $25.

So, the remaining budget is $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her and her friends.

- The remaining budget is $65.
- The cost for arcade tokens is $5.

So, the money left for her and her friends is $65 - $5 = $60.

Since each person (Morgan and her friends) gets to play one round of mini-golf and ride the go-karts twice, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost per person for these activities.

- The cost per person for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we divide the remaining money by the cost per person:

- The remaining money is $60.
- The cost per person is $25.

So, the number of friends she can invite is $60 / $25 = 2.4.

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, we can only invite 2 friends.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day.

She buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost of lollipops each day is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets as pocket money each day. She gets $5 every day.

Now, let's find out how much money Marisa saves each day by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Marisa saves $4 each day.

Finally, to find out how much money she saves over 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He has $10 and spent half of his change on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half of his change is the amount he spent on candy. So, the total amount he spent on candy is:

$2 (spent on gumballs) * 2 = $4

Now, we know the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$4 / $1.5 per pound = 2.666...

Since Billy can't buy a fraction of a pound of candy, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Billy bought 2 pounds of candy.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To solve this, let's use a simple equation based on the information given.

Carver's age is 45 years. According to the problem, this is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let's call the son's age ""S"".

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \).

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ \frac{50}{2} = S \]
\[ 25 = S \]

So, the son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out the total distance the train travels in one trip.

The train travels:
- 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
- 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
- 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the distance for the third leg is 50 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances for one trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.6667 days.

Since the train can't go for a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. So, the train needs service every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
27"
"First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. So, the average is:

\[ \text{Average stuffing} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now we know:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the collie beds:
\[ 3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to get the total:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total pounds of stuffing Mark needs is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. He drove 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to get to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{200}{70} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance he drove to his friend's house including the detour is:

\[ \text{Total distance to friend's house} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's calculate the time he spent driving back home. He drove 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time to home} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Time to home} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the total time for the trip, we add the time to get to his friend's house and the time to get back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time to home} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 2.857 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

Let's add these times.
\[ \text{Total time} = 2.857 + 3 = 5.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is approximately 5.857 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 total students - 43 girls = 53 boys

On Friday, 5 girls were absent. So, the number of girls present is:

43 girls - 5 absent girls = 38 girls present

We also know that 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present is:

53 boys - 4 absent boys = 49 boys present

So, the final numerical answer is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we need to add the points she scored on her first and second tests and then subtract that total from 42.

Jane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. So, the total points from the first two tests is:
15 + 18 = 33 points

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, the points she needs on her third test is:
42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. A total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as \( S \).

From the information given:
- The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( S = 4 \times 3 - 5 \).

Calculate \( S \):
\[ S = 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence:
\[ P = 3 \times S = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out:
\[ 3 \text{ (mask refusal)} + 7 \text{ (shoplifting)} + 21 \text{ (physical violence)} = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's find out how many points Erin has now. We know that Sara scored 8 points and Erin has three times more points than Sara.

So, Erin's points now = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's points now = 3 * 8
Erin's points now = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points after scoring some points. So, to find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the points she scored after from the points she has now.

Erin's points before = Erin's points now - Points scored after
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors, so we need 44 frames. The cost for the frames is:
\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \]

Next, we need to add the additional 20% cost for etching the logo on each frame. The additional cost per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]
So, the total cost for each frame including the additional etching is:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]
Therefore, the total cost for all 44 frames is:
\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Now, we need to add the cost of the pins for 2 seniors. Each pin costs $5, so the total cost for the pins is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. So, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of shoes sold on Saturday. So, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.
4. **Returns**: Six pairs of shoes were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total sold.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold:

- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 14 pairs

Total pairs sold before returns: \(14 + 28 + 14 = 56\) pairs.

Subtract the returns: \(56 - 6 = 50\) pairs.

So, the final number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs."

"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning.

The total number of pieces of equipment is $400000 worth, but we don't know how many pieces there are. However, we can calculate the value of the functioning pieces based on the percentage.

Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, 60% of the equipment is functioning. So, we calculate 60% of $400000.

60% of $400000 = 0.60 * $400000 = $240000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000."

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:

40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils remaining.

One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green, so:

20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

20 pupils - 5 pupils = 15 pupils like yellow.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday.
   - She sold them at $4 per piece.
   - She got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.
   - To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money by the price per apple:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. So, 10 pairs of socks would be:
10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 socks

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she washed is:
20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks

There are 50 socks that need washing in total. To find out how many socks Lindsay missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks:
50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To solve this, let's break it down into simpler steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the total interest Karan will pay. The interest is 10% of the amount she borrowed. So, we calculate 10% of $3,650:
   - 10% of $3,650 = 0.10 * $3,650 = $365

2. Now, we add the interest to the original amount to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
   - Total amount = Original amount + Interest = $3,650 + $365 = $4,015

3. Karan has to pay this total amount over 5 months. To find out how much she has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by 5:
   - Amount per month = Total amount / 5 = $4,015 / 5 = $803

So, Karan has to pay $803 per month.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 67 kilometers."
"First, let's find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many cups of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Now, we know that she spent $18 to buy the supplies. To find out her profit, we subtract the cost from the total money she makes:

$36 - $18 = $18

Millie sells all the lemonade, so to find out how much profit she makes per hour, we need to know how long her lemonade stand is open. The problem doesn't specify the number of hours, but it tells us that she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Since she sells all 36 cups, we can calculate the number of hours her lemonade stand is open:

36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Finally, to find out her profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours her lemonade stand is open:

$18 / 9 hours = $2/hour

So, the final numerical answer is $2 per hour."
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step:

1. Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left.
2. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.
3. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1/5 of his land is, and then multiply that by 5.

Let's do the math:

1. If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares divided by 2.
2. 12.8 hectares ÷ 2 = 6.4 hectares. So, 1/5 of his land is 6.4 hectares.
3. Now, to find out the total land he had at first, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5.
4. 6.4 hectares × 5 = 32 hectares.

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir.

The choir has 52 members in total. Since 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of boys and girls as follows:

- Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
- Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of people performing is the number of girls, which is 26.

However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 girls can't make it:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 1/2 * 26 = 13
- Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

Then, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

The final numerical answer is 16."

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.
- So, the cost of 6 erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.
- So, the cost of 8 pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- The total cost is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many messages Mr. Yu receives. Since Mr. Yu gets 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, to find the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"First, let's calculate how much money David spends. David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. So, David spends $30.

Next, let's calculate how much money Dasha spends. Dasha buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and she needs 9 rides. So, she needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, she spends 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

Now, let's find out how much money they would have spent if they didn't buy the ride bracelet and just bought tickets. They would need 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. So, they would spend 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

David saves the difference between what Dasha spends and what David spends. Dasha spends $36 and David spends $30, so David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

Monica has:
- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

She has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts.

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, and then find the difference between the number of popsicles they have.

First, let's understand the ratio given: 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

1. Let's say Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts. The total parts they have together is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.
2. Since the total number of popsicles is 165, each part is equal to 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.
3. Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
   - Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
   - Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.
4. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services Tim will get.

Netflix costs $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. So, the savings for Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \text{ dollars each} \]
So, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars each} \]

Now, let's add the costs of Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 8 + 8 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now, with the streaming services, he pays $26 a month. So, the amount of money he saves each month is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much time Carol spent recording the song. She spent half the time recording as she did writing, so:

- Time spent writing: 4 hours
- Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours

Next, we need to convert all the time spent into the same unit. Let's use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time spent:

- Total time spent: 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time spent}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of slots in the shelving system:**
   - The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   - To find the total number of slots, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
     \[
     6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots}
     \]

2. **Calculate double the number of slots:**
   - Wendy wants to place double the number of books in the shelving system.
   - Double the number of slots is:
     \[
     2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

3. **Add 20 more books:**
   - Wendy wants to place 20 more books than double the number of slots.
   - Adding 20 to 72:

"Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which totals 24 + 5 = 29 cards. She also received 17 cards from family and friends. 

To find out how many cards Erica now has, we add the cards she made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received, and then subtract the cards she passed out:

20 (made by Erica) + 30 (brought by her dad) + 17 (received) - 29 (passed out) = 38 cards.

So, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica now has is 38."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Mark already has $50. The bike costs $300. So, he needs $300 - $50 = $250 more. Since he earns $10 per day, he needs $250 ÷ $10 = 25 days to save the money. 

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. She saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, we calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs Nancy saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs Nancy saw:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

"First, let's find out how old Beth is. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, let's find out how old Alice is. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now we know Alice is 42 years old and Erica is 30 years old. To find the difference between their ages:

Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."

"First, let's figure out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, he needs:
- 4 times the flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups of flour} \)
- 4 times the milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups of milk} \)

Now, let's see how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so for 12 cups of flour:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags of flour} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so for 4 cups of milk:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles of milk} \)

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
- \( 6 \text{ bags of flour} - 2 \text{ bottles of milk} = 4 \)

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. It uses 900 watts of energy.

To find out how much energy it uses in one day, we multiply the energy used in one hour by the number of hours it's used each day:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much energy it uses in one day after Mel reduces the time by 5 hours:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times (8 - 5) \text{ hours/day} = 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

Now, we calculate the energy used in one day after the reduction:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To find out how much energy it uses in 30 days after the reduction:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81000 \text{ watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we convert the energy used in 30 days to kilowatt-hours:
\[ 81000 \text{ watt-hours} \div 1000 = 81 \text{ kWh} \]

So, the amount of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 81 \text{ kWh} \]

The final numerical answer is 29.33 (rounded to two decimal places)."
"First, let's figure out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide 20 by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to find out how many pounds of meat and cheese are needed for 5 sandwiches.

For meat:
5 sandwiches × 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat

For cheese:
5 sandwiches × 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so:
5 pounds × $7.00/pound = $35.00

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so:
5 pounds × $3.00/pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has initially is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, he bought:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns} \]

So, the new total number of corns is:

\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns} \]

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis:

\[ 100 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"First, let's find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Now, we know Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the entire book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to start reading 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to leave. Therefore, he will be 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes early.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each employee earns in a month. Each employee works 40 hours a week and is paid $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for each employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

In May, the company hired 40 employees. So, the total pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 600 \text{ dollars/employee} = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means that 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]
So, 10 employees' contracts expired, and the other 30 employees' contracts continued. The 30 employees who continued to work in June still earn $600 per week. The 10 employees who lost their contracts did not work in June, so their pay for June is $0.

The total pay for the 30 employees who continued to work in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 600 \text{ dollars/employee} = 18000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total pay for May and June to get the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars} + 18000 \text{ dollars} = 42000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{42000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for 2 pounds, the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the money she has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400. The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

Now, let's add the cost of the two packs together: $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200: $1200 * 20% = $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a finale firework that costs $150.

Now, let's add the cost of the fireworks after the discount and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."

- 5% of the candles are dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

To find out how many candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate 5% of 50,000:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, 2,500 candles are dangerous and have the defect.

Since the question asks for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, and we know that only the dangerous candles have the defect, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of dangerous candles with the defect.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

2500"
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. The regular price is $20, and there's a 30% discount.

To find 30% of $20, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$20 = \frac{30}{100} \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = \$6 \]

So, the discount price for each blouse is:
\[ \$20 - \$6 = \$14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses is:
\[ 4 \times \$14 = \$56 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$56 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: half of 30, which is 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: let's call this number \( x \) apples.

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total Apples:**
   - Combined total: 500 apples.

Now, let's add up the apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:
- Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \).
- Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).

The combined total is:
\[ (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final numerical answer is:
350"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries:
     \[
     c + d = 180
     \]
   - Each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of humps is:
     \[
     2c + d = 304
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     c + d = 180 \\
     2c + d = 304
     \end{cases}
     \]

4. **Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):**
   \[
   (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
   \]
   \[
   2c + d - c - d = 124
   \]
   \[
   c = 124
   \]

5. **Substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):**
   \[
   124 + d = 180
   \]
   \[
   d = 180 - 124
   \]
   \[
   d = 56
   \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
56"
"To solve this, let's break down the trip into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for these 4 days = 4 days * 200 km/day = 800 kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 kilometers.

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find Timothy's locker size, we need to double Zack's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches

So, the final numerical answer is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 4,000 feet. So, the comb fell 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Oliver was at 3,000 feet and Stanley's comb is at 4,000 feet. So, Oliver needs to climb 4,000 - 3,000 = 1,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 1,000 feet."
"First, let's find out how much money Mr. Josue got from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. So, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, let's add the money he got from both banks to his initial capital. He initially had $5000. So, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

17000"
"First, let's calculate how many cats were taken away by the boats. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken away is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the original number of cats:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. We know that 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of the 30 cats:

3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 a month.
   - So, for 6 months, it's 6 * $8 = $48.

2. For the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), the cost is $12 a month.
   - So, for 2 months, it's 2 * $12 = $24.

3. For the next 12 months (months 9 to 20), the cost is $14 a month.
   - So, for 12 months, it's 12 * $14 = $168.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
- $48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $168 (next 12 months) = $240.

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $240."
"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so:

Jogger jeans cost = Tattered jeans cost - $6
Jogger jeans cost = $28 - $6
Jogger jeans cost = $22

Now, let's find out the total cost of both jeans:
Total cost = Tattered jeans cost + Jogger jeans cost
Total cost = $28 + $22
Total cost = $50

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can find out how much he saved from each.

Let's say he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans. So, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is:
Amount saved from jogger jeans = 1/3 * Total savings
Amount saved from jogger jeans = 1/3 * $6
Amount saved from jogger jeans = $2

The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans:
Amount saved from tattered jeans = Total savings - Amount saved from jogger jeans
Amount saved from tattered jeans = $6 - $2
Amount saved from tattered jeans = $4

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22. So, the difference is:

Difference = Tattered jeans cost - Jogger jeans cost
Difference = $28 - $22
Difference = $6

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans."
"First, let's calculate the total capacity of the buses:
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.

So, the total capacity of the buses is:
4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.

So, the total capacity of the minibusses is:
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

Then, let's calculate the total capacity of the minivans:
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.

So, the total capacity of the minivans is:
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, let's add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total capacity for the day trip:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. So, she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds a day.
Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds a day.

So, the store-bought feeders will attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds a day.
And the feeders Lillian made will attract 6 * 30 = 180 birds a day.

In total, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 180 = 240 birds each day in her garden.

The final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's find out how much the soup cost. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we know the cake costs half of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. This means he sold the rest of his cards for $50.
2. Each card is sold for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he got ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Let's do the division:
\[ \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{500}{15} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, he sold 33 cards.

4. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. This means he sold 2/3 of his cards.
5. If 2/3 of his cards is equal to 33 cards, we can find out the total number of cards he started with by setting up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Cards} = 33 \]
\[ \text{Total Cards} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 33 \times 1.5 = 49.5 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and we know he sold 33 cards, we can conclude he started with 49 cards (since 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total, and 49 cards represent 3/3 of his total).

So, Kenny started with 49 cards."
"First, let's figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. He was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. There were 36 guests, so half of the guests is:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared is:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

But then, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 more guests couldn't get a second hotdog. So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many letters are in Indras' sister's name. We know Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of that would be 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it would have 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, to find out the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name. So, 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 is:
$165.00 * 20% = $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's add up the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

Now, let's add up the money Dora has:
- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
- Total cost: $19
- Total money Dora has: $18

Money Dora still needs = $19 - $18 = $1

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Prince Arthur slew 3 quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. So, Prince Arthur slew \(100 \times \frac{3}{4} = 75\) dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew \(75 \times 2 = 150\) dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew \(150 \times \frac{1}{5} = 30\) dragons.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's find out how much gas is in each container. If 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container will have:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needs 1/4 of a container. So, the amount of gas Josey needs is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, 0.75 gallons is:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"First, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. He got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for chips is:
3 bags * 40 cents/bag = 120 cents

Now, let's find out how much money George had left after buying chips. He spent $5, which is 500 cents. If he had 1% of his money left, then 1% of 500 cents is:
1% of 500 cents = 500 cents * 1/100 = 5 cents

So, the amount of money George spent on chips and the amount he had left is:
120 cents (for chips) + 5 cents (left) = 125 cents

Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent a total of 500 cents, and he spent 125 cents on chips, so the money spent on candy bars is:
500 cents - 125 cents = 375 cents

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
375 cents / 75 cents per candy bar = 5 candy bars

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

20 ounces - 2 ounces = 18 ounces

So, the remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"First, let's find out how many oranges they have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, we add these together:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Now, they want to share these 56 oranges equally among themselves and their 6 friends. That means the oranges will be shared among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

Now we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

So, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"First, let's find out how long it takes to drive to the theater from Wayne's hotel. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Now, we know that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. So, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 5 minutes before the 16 minutes it takes her to drive, which means:
\[ 16 - 5 = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by dividing the area by the length.

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate how many beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:

"First, let's calculate how much the temperature rises when Marcus is baking. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total increase in temperature is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after baking is:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The temperature drops by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the temperature drops by:
\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature after opening the window is:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Jon to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes James:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon's swim time
  10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes
  So, James's swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

- Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon's bike time
  Jon's bike time = 80 minutes
  So, James's bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
James's total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it took James to run. We know the total time for James and the times for the swim and bike:
James's total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time
180 = 36 + 85 + Run time
180 = 121 + Run time
Run time = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

So, the time it took James to do the run is 59 minutes."

"First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour, so in 30 minutes (which is half an hour), the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Michael's horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

1 dozen equals 12 eggs, so 4 dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs in total.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses of eggnog.

Now, each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays.

So, the final numerical answer is 2 trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

Joey's initial points: 214
Points Joey scores: 26

Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points Marcy scores: 10

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning:

Joey's new score: 240
Marcy's new score: 235

Difference in points = Joey's new score - Marcy's new score
Difference in points = 240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's find out how much the salesman spent on the sneakers. He bought 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate how much he made from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers he sold to the department store. He sold 17 out of 48, so:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

He sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, let's add the money he made from both sales to find the total money he made:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total money made:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each have 8 pieces:
   - 6 packets * 8 pieces/packet = 48 pieces

2. Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each have 16 pieces:
   - 4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

3. Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons:
   - 48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces

So, Beatrice bought 112 pieces of crayons in all.

The final numerical answer is 112."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a popcorn and a soda.
2. The regular ticket costs $12 and you have to buy a popcorn and a soda separately.
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
4. So, the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of the popcorn and soda is $2 more than the super ticket.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the popcorn and soda together is \( P + 3 \) (since the soda costs $3).

So, the total cost of the regular ticket plus the popcorn and soda is:
\[ 12 + (P + 3) \]

We know this total is $2 more than the super ticket:
\[ 12 + (P + 3) = 20 + 2 \]

Now, let's solve for \( P \):
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 22 \]
\[ P + 15 = 22 \]
\[ P = 22 - 15 \]
\[ P = 7 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $7.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"First, let's find out how much it cost to fill one balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20 to find the cost per balloon.

\[
\text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{900}{20} = 45
\]

On the second day, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, we add $20 to the cost per balloon on the first day:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon on the second day} = 45 + 20 = 65
\]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 per balloon:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To calculate \(170 \times 65\), we can break it down:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

First, calculate \(170 \times 60\):

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]

Next, calculate \(170 \times 5\):

\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Now, add these two results together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.
- For the second part, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's add up the total distance and the total time:
- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
- Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after trading.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires, so she has:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires left} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Now, let's calculate the value of the rubies she gets from trading. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:
\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ \$6400 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that Marin eats 4 apples a day. So in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we know that Nancy also eats 4 apples a day. So in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many apples they eat together in 30 days, we add the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to find out the total volume of the raised beds. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of all the raised beds is:

\[ 32 \text{ cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \text{ beds} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1920 \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, then:

60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the total number of green cards is:

15 (red cards) + 9 (additional green cards) = 24 green cards

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. So:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39 yellow cards

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78 cards

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. So, her friend saw \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.
3. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that Katelyn saw, so the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"First, let's find out how many puppies have spots in total.

Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies.
Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies.

So, the total number of spotted puppies is:
3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's find out the total number of puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.

So, the total number of puppies is:
8 + 12 = 20

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 0.35 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 35\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35%."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles in one week.

For cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda each week.
- So, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from cans each week.

For bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water each week.
- So, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from bottles each week.

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles to find out how much she earns in one week:
- Total earnings per week = \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings in four weeks = \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is:
84"
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. If Frederick has 10 plants, then:

60% of 10 plants is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \text{ plants} \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, if Toni has 16 plants, then:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, we multiply:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, let's find out how many baseball cards she has. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, we multiply:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, let's add the total number of cards she has:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Miss Maria gives the remaining 300 cards to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we divide the remaining cards by 10 to find out how many students she has:

300 cards ÷ 10 cards/student = 30 students

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 900 cents

Becky received a $1 discount. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, the discount is 100 cents. So, the final amount Becky paid is:
900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. A 10 percent discount on 1000 cents is:
1000 cents * 10% = 100 cents

So, the final amount Kelly paid is:
1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky.

Kelly paid 900 cents and Becky paid 800 cents, so the difference is:
900 cents - 800 cents = 100 cents

100 cents is the same as 1 dollar.

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky."

So, the final numerical answer is 1200."
"First, let's figure out how many shoes Fireman Frank has after Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

He starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
So, after Monday, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
After Wednesday, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
After Friday, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
So, after Saturday, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday is 120."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can make with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.
2. The number of cookies he can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra.

Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks. According to the problem, the number of cookies he can have is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).

We know that the total number of cookies he can have is 5. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:
2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches (the combined length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches).

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer.

2. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Since this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
   \]

3. To find the total number of students, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

"First, let's find out how many kids are allergic to something. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids allergic to something, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid counting them twice).

So, the calculation is:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12 kids allergic to something.

Now, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class.

So, the calculation is:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to something) = 20 kids not allergic to anything.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's find out how many employees there are in total. There are 3 groups of 200 employees each. So we multiply 3 by 200:

Next, we need to find out how many tour guides there are in total. Each of the 3 groups has 7 tour guides, so we multiply 3 by 7:

3 * 7 = 21

So there are 21 tour guides going on the tour.

Now, to find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees to the number of tour guides:

600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621

So the total number of people going on the tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, so:
\[ 2 \times \$5000 = \$10000 \]

Next, let's find out how much the hotel costs. The normal price for a hotel per day is $1500. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$1500 = 0.20 \times \$1500 = \$300 \]
\[ \text{Increased price per day} = \$1500 + \$300 = \$1800 \]

They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ \$10000 + \$5400 = \$15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \$15400 \]

"First, let's find the weight of the 2010 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 2010 penny and the weight of the 1959 penny:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

"First, let's add up how much money Keegan and Tashay have earned together by 3 pm:

Keegan earned $83
Tashay earned $91

So, together they have earned $83 + $91 = $174

Now, they need to raise $200 in total. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has. We know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Gabriel has 20 songs, so:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Both players can store up to 100 songs, so:

\[ \text{Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]
\[ \text{Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

\[ \text{Fewer songs Luri can add} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. He ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked 60 oranges in total.

To find 2/5 of 60, we can do the following calculation:

1. Divide 60 by 5 to find 1/5 of 60.
2. Then multiply the result by 2 to find 2/5 of 60.

Let's do the calculation:

1. \( 60 \div 5 = 12 \)
2. \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Now, Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate. To find out the total amount of money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:

\( 24 \times 10 = 240 \)

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

The final numerical answer is:
240"
"First, let's find out how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. If her shoes cost $80, then:

3 times $80 = $80 * 3 = $240

Now, we know that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than this amount. So we subtract $20 from $240:

$240 - $20 = $220

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

The final numerical answer is:
$220"
"First, let's calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles he runs by his speed:

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, the final numerical answer is 6 hours."
"First, let's find out how much oats one horse needs for one meal:
- Each horse needs 5 pounds of oats per meal.

Next, let's find out how much oats one horse needs for one day:
- Since the horse eats twice a day, we multiply the amount of oats per meal by 2.
- So, 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day for one horse.

Now, let's find out how much oats all four horses need for one day:
- Since there are four horses, we multiply the amount of oats one horse needs per day by 4.
- So, 10 pounds * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day for all horses.

Now, let's find out how much oats all four horses need for five days:
- We multiply the amount of oats all horses need per day by 5.
- So, 40 pounds * 5 = 200 pounds of oats for five days.

Finally, let's find out how many bags of oats are needed:
- Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in one bag.
- So, 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

The final numerical answer is 4 bags."

-30 ÷ 3 = -10 degrees

So, the average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to find out how much more money the child needs to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4. So, we subtract the amount the child already has from the cost of the toy car:

$12 - $4 = $8

The child needs to save $8 more. He promises to save $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take him to save $8, we divide the amount he needs to save by the amount he saves each day:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Each tray can hold 24 eggs. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:

2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, 16 eggs won't be placed on the tray."
"First, let's find out how much the family-size pizza costs. The small pizza costs $8, and the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much, so:

Family-size pizza cost = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24 = $32

So, Sally spends $32 in all."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors. Normally, each pack costs $4.00, but they are on sale for ""buy one get one free"". So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack. That means she pays $4.00 for 2 packs.

2. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, after using the coupon, she only pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for the 2 packs.

3. Now, we need to find out how much each razor costs. There are 4 razors in each pack, so for 2 packs, there are 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

4. Heather pays $2.00 for 8 razors. To find out how much each razor costs, we divide $2.00 by 8.

5. $2.00 is the same as 200 cents. So, we divide 200 cents by 8.

6. 200 ÷ 8 = 25

So, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount.

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall and the 10th is 60"" tall. 

To find the average height, we add up all the heights and divide by the total number of cheerleaders:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} \]

Let's calculate the numerator first:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \]
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \]

Now, divide by 10:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches} \]

The average height of the cheerleaders is 63.6 inches.

Now, let's build the human pyramid. The shortest cheerleader is at the top, and the heights of the cheerleaders are 63.6 inches on average. Since the pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top, we can calculate the total height of the pyramid by multiplying the average height by the number of cheerleaders:

\[ \text{Total height} = 63.6 \times 10 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
\[ \text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 53 \text{ feet} \]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total minutes she walks in one day by multiplying 8 hours by 5 minutes per hour.

8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day

Now, to find out how many minutes she has walked after 5 days, we multiply the daily walking minutes by 5.

40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old in four years.

To find out Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years. So, Angela is 42 - 4 = 38 years old right now.

The final numerical answer is 38."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost for each type of ride and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- So, the cost for one day's morning rides is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
- He drives like this for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for the morning rides over 14 days is \(14 \times 12 = 168\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- So, the cost for one day's afternoon rides is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- He drives like this for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for the afternoon rides over 14 days is \(14 \times 4 = 56\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost for morning rides: $168
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $56
- Total cost for driving the car over 14 days: \(168 + 56 = 224\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many guests are needed for the cost of both venues to be the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( n \).

For the first venue:
- The cost is a flat fee of $200.
- Each guest costs $5 for food.
- So, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5n \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per guest.
- Food is already included, so the total cost for the second venue is \( 25n \).

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of both venues are equal. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides to isolate the terms with \( n \) on one side:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. Then Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects (since Lily found 7 more than David).
3. Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects (since David found half of what Bodhi found).
4. Together they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4D + 7 = 43
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   4D = 36
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   D = 9
   \]
8. Now we know David found 9 insects. So Lily found \( D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

The number of insects Lily found is 16."

"First, let's find out how wide the rug is. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet wide.

Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is:

2 * 8 feet = 16 feet.

So, the couch is 2 feet longer than 16 feet, which means:

16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. We know that two of these packs were strawberry flavored. So, the other two packs were grape and green apple.

She paid $2 for each pack of grape gum. So, for two packs of grape gum, she paid:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. Since she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum, half of that is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, we know the total amount she paid was $7. We can find out how much she paid for the strawberry gum by subtracting the amount she paid for the grape and green apple gum from the total amount:
\[ 7 - 4 - 1 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum and she paid $2 in total for these two packs, each pack of strawberry gum cost:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost 1 dollar."
"First, let's find out how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

6 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $72.00

So, the final numerical answer is $72.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each week.

She takes 2 bus trips a day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, we can find out how much she saves by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."

"Let's call the cost of the lot ""L"". According to the question, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can say the cost of the house is ""3L"".

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So the lot costs $30,000. Now, to find the cost of the house, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3:

\[ \text{Cost of the house} = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So the house costs $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:

93 loaves sold in the morning + 39 loaves sold in the afternoon + 6 loaves returned = 138 loaves.

Now, subtract this from the total loaves baked:
200 loaves baked - 138 loaves sold and returned = 62 loaves left.

So, the final numerical answer is 62."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips that fit in one row:

36 red tulips ÷ 6 red tulips/row = 6 rows of red tulips

Next, we do the same for the blue tulips. He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips that fit in one row:

24 blue tulips ÷ 8 blue tulips/row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to find the total number of rows:

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins Heather has in total. She has 27 cups of raisins.

Next, we need to divide these 27 cups equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, we divide 27 cups by 3:

27 ÷ 3 = 9

Heather will have 9 cups of raisins for each of the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the total raisins for oatmeal cookies by the raisins needed per batch:

9 ÷ (3/4) = 9 × (4/3) = 36/3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

12"
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.

So, the cost per day before adding the new device is:
\[ 12 \text{ kilowatts/hour} \times \$1.50/\text{kilowatt/hour} = \$18.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the daily consumption after adding the new device:
- The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
- So, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \text{ kilowatts/hour} + 2 \text{ kilowatts/hour} = 14 \text{ kilowatts/hour} \]

The cost per day after adding the new device is:
\[ 14 \text{ kilowatts/hour} \times \$1.50/\text{kilowatt/hour} = \$21.00 \]

Next, we calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

Weekly cost before adding the new device:
\[ \$18.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$126.00 \]

Weekly cost after adding the new device:
\[ \$21.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$147.00 \]

Finally, we find the difference between the weekly costs:
\[ \$147.00 - \$126.00 = \$21.00 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$21.00 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \]

So, one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint:

\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day} \]

This means 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 48 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, she must have \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna must have \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together.

- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have together is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final numerical answer is:
172"
"First, let's find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We know he spent $4 on a CD and the total was $48. So, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:

$48 - $4 = $44

This means Tom spent $44 on the headphone set.

Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have $44 left. We need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with this money. Each CD costs $4, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to add up all the hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, for these 6 weeks, the total hours are:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, for these 2 weeks, the total hours are:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, for this 1 week, the total hours are:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours from each period:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   48 - 8 = 40 people.
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus now is:
   40 + 40 = 80 people.
4. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   80 - 21 = 59 people.
5. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer means 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus now is:
   59 + 7 = 66 people.

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"First, let's find out Jame's current age. If he will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Now, let's figure out his cousin's age in 8 years. We know that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find out his cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now, to find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how much Errol paid for the printer. Since he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, let's add the cost of the computer and the printer:
$1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800

Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. We already know that the computer and the printer together cost $1,800. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is:
$2,400 (total) - $1,800 (computer and printer) = $600

Since the cost of 2 monitors is $600, the cost of one monitor is:
$600 / 2 = $300

So, the final numerical answer is $300."
"First, we need to find out how many kids are in each group. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, we divide 20 by 2:

20 ÷ 2 = 10

So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. We need to find out how many seashells each girl brought back. According to the question, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

The number of seashells each boy brought is 60. So, four times as many seashells as the boys would be:

4 × 60 = 240

Now, we add this to the number of seashells each boy brought:

60 + 240 = 300

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

The final numerical answer is 300."
"George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.
Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

10 years (Chenny's age) - 4 years = 6 years (Alyana's age)

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

6 years (Alyana's age) + 2 years = 8 years (Anne's age)

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, to find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total she needs to make.

She has made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week
- 21 vlogs in the second week
- 15 vlogs in the third week

So, the total vlogs she has made so far is:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

She needs to make 72 vlogs in total, so the number of vlogs she still needs to make is:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's find out how much the tip is. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as follows:
- 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20.
- So, 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, to evenly split the $50 dinner bill, we divide it by 2:
- $50 / 2 = $25.

Then, we add the tip to the half of the bill:
- $25 (half of the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35.

So, you ended up paying $35."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. Each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

2. The eldest boy gets $6 initially. He adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

3. The next day, he adds another $10 to his share, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

4. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

5. He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to know how many days are in April. April has 30 days.

2. Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, if we divide the month into two halves, each half has 15 days.

3. Let's say Elvis saves $x in the first half of the month. Then he saves $2x in the second half of the month.

4. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half, which is $x + $2x = $3x.

5. We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125. So, $3x = $1125.

6. To find out how much Elvis saves each day in the second half, we need to solve for x first. 

7. $3x = $1125
   $x = $1125 / 3
   $x = $375

8. So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month.

9. In the second half, he saves twice as much, which is $2 * $375 = $750.

10. Now, to find out how much he has to save each day in the second half, we divide the total savings for the second half by the number of days in the second half.

11. $750 / 15 days = $50 per day.

So, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- So, the cost of the apples is \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- So, the cost of the oranges is \(5 \times 0.80 = 4.00\).

Then, let's calculate the cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- So, the cost of the peaches is \(6 \times 0.75 = 4.50\).

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = cost of apples + cost of oranges + cost of peaches
- Total cost = \(4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00\).

Verna gave $20 to buy the fruits. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change = amount given - total cost
- Change = \(20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract the amount Jenny gets from the amount Jairus gets:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

6"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Brad gets x dollars.
2. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets 4x dollars.
3. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation: x + 4x = 100.
4. This simplifies to 5x = 100.
5. To find x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 100 / 5 = 20.
6. So Brad gets 20 dollars.
7. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day he works. So, each day he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

2. If he has to work 5 times a week, we need to multiply the miles he walks each day by the number of days he works in a week. So, 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 30 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Elise writes the alphabet twice in full. So, she writes 26 letters twice, which is 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
3. Then she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.
4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes the 52 letters she wrote in step 2 and the 13 letters she wrote in step 3, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

"First, let's find out how many toys James's play set needs to be five times larger than his current 80 toys.

Five times 80 toys is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

So, James's play set needs 400 toys to be five times larger.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. This means Jonathan needs 400 toys in total.

If Jonathan needs 400 toys in total and he needs 2 more toys than he already has, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of toys Jonathan already has} + 2 = 400 \]

Let's call the number of toys Jonathan already has \( x \). So:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 398 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- One notebook costs $1.50, so five notebooks cost \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- One pen costs $0.25, so two pens cost \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- One calculator costs $12.
- One geometry set costs $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. So, we need to calculate 10% of $20.00 and subtract it from $20.00:
\[10\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.10 \times 20.00 = 2.00\]
\[20.00 - 2.00 = 18.00\]

So, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 of sales. Since Antonella earns a 30% commission on the first $1000, we calculate:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]
   So, Antonella earns $300 from the first $1000 of sales.

2. Next, we need to calculate the commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella earns an additional 10% commission on the sales over $1000. The amount of sales over $1000 is:
   \[
   2500 - 1000 = 1500
   \]
   So, the additional commission is:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]
   This means Antonella earns an additional $150 from the sales over $1000.

3. To find the total commission, we add the two amounts together:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

So, Antonella earned a total of $450.

"First, let's find out how many bottles Bill has initially. He has 2 cases of water and each case has 24 bottles. So, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests. So, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it's cold. So we calculate:
- Twice as long as 16 minutes is 16 * 2 = 32 minutes.
- 2 minutes more than 32 minutes is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

So, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water conditions.

For cold water:
- Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- So, for 3 miles, it would be 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

For warm water:
- Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.
- So, for 3 miles, it would be 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:
- 102 minutes (warm water) - 48 minutes (cold water) = 54 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 54 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in one day. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

Next, let's find out how much he earns in one week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by the amount he earns in one week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

So, the final numerical answer is 160."
"First, let's find out how many buttons had four holes. We know there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes. So, the rest had four holes.

21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons had four holes each. So, we need to calculate the total number of holes in these 14 buttons.

14 buttons * 4 holes per button = 56 holes

Now, we need to calculate the total number of holes in the 7 buttons that had two holes.

7 buttons * 2 holes per button = 14 holes

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons together to get the total number of holes.

56 holes + 14 holes = 70 holes

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we need to divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.

So, Zack's locker is \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) cubic inches.

Now, let's find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we need to divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches.

So, Peter's locker is \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is 3 cubic inches."

\[ \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks:

\[ \text{Cups to reduce} = 5 - 4 = 1 \text{ cup} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so:
3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up all their weights and divide by the number of friends:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Now we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees up from the pyramid every hour.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

To find out how much the sun has moved up in 10 hours, we multiply the rate of movement by the time:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add this to the original angle of the pyramids from the ground:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
82"
"First, let's find out how old the second son is. The second son is 4 years younger than the first son, who is 12 years old. So, the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, James needs candles for both sons. So, he needs 12 candles for the first son and 8 candles for the second son. In total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

So, the final numerical answer is $12."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, in the first week, she read:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the second week. We know she read a total of 100 pages in the second week.

Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate how many pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of minutes she read by the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 105 \times 1.3333 = 138.3333 \approx 138 \text{ pages} \]

Finally, to find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week:
\[ 138 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 238 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{238} \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so he ate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so he ate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Together, they ate:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's figure out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years. If Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years he will be:

44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the question, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x \), then:

51 = 3 * \( x \)

To find \( x \), we divide 51 by 3:

\( x = \frac{51}{3} = 17 \)

So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from 17:

17 - 7 = 10

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So for three teeth, that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the first three teeth was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So for two teeth, that's $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the money the tooth fairy gave Sharon:

$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"First, let's find out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and Richie scored 80 goals, we can subtract 20 from 80 to find out how many goals Mark scored.

80 - 20 = 60 goals

Now, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can subtract 45 from Richie's total to find out how many goals Anna scored.

80 - 45 = 35 goals

Now we know:
- Mark scored 60 goals
- Anna scored 35 goals
- Richie scored 80 goals

To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored in total, we add their goals together:

60 + 35 + 80 = 175 goals

So, the final numerical answer is 175 goals."
"First, let's find out how much Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each costs $5.

Number of days from Sunday to Wednesday: 4 days
Cost per wooden action figure: $5

Total cost for wooden action figures:
4 days * $5/day = $20

Now, let's see how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures.

Money Peter has initially: $70
Money spent on wooden action figures: $20

Money left after buying wooden action figures:
$70 - $20 = $50

Next, Peter will buy plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday. Each plastic action figure costs $2.

Number of days from Thursday to Sunday: 4 days
Cost per plastic action figure: $2

Total cost for plastic action figures:
4 days * $2/day = $8

Now, let's see how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money.

Money left after buying wooden action figures: $50
Cost per plastic action figure: $2

Number of plastic action figures Peter can buy:
$50 / $2 = 25 plastic action figures

Now, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures together.

Number of wooden action figures: 4
Number of plastic action figures: 25

Total number of action figures:
4 + 25 = 29

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 29."

"First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops every week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, every week Ford supplies:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Now, let's find out how many roses Ford grows every month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

The flower shops need:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the roses the shops need from the roses Ford grows:
160 roses/month - 65 roses/month = 95 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 95 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Katina starts with $3000.
2. She removes $100 every month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.
4. In 24 months, she will remove $100 * 24 = $2400.
5. So, the remaining amount in her account after 2 years will be $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many sandwiches they can make with the bread they have. They spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches. So, with $30.00, they can make:

\[ \frac{30.00}{3.00} \times 10 = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much they spend on the cheeses and condiments for 100 sandwiches. They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches. So, for 100 sandwiches, they would spend:

\[ \frac{30.00}{10} \times 100 = 30.00 \times 10 = 300.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for making 100 sandwiches. The cost of bread is $30.00 and the cost of cheeses and condiments is $300.00. So, the total cost is:

\[ 30.00 + 300.00 = 330.00 \]

They sell each sandwich for $7.00. So, for 100 sandwiches, they would earn:

\[ 100 \times 7.00 = 700.00 \]

Finally, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 700.00 - 330.00 = 370.00 \]

So, the net profit is:

\[ \boxed{370.00} \]"

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

If she can sell each muffin for $1.50, then the total money she can make is:

24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

So, the final numerical answer is $36.00."
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
- The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
- Area = length × width = 18 feet × 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
- The padding costs $2 per square foot.
- Total cost for new carpet and padding = $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot.
- Cost for 216 square feet = 216 square feet × $14 per square foot = $3024.

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
- The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
- Cost for removing the old carpet = 216 square feet × $4 per square foot = $864.

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
- The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.
- Cost for installing the new carpet = 216 square feet × $34 per square foot = $7344.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of new carpet and padding = $3024
- Cost of removing the old carpet = $864
- Cost of installing the new carpet = $7344
- Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together:
50 (Day 1) + 50 (Day 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4) + 120 (Day 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 450 birds

Now we know Mack saw a total of 450 birds over 7 days. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

450 birds ÷ 7 days = 64.2857 birds per day

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average is 64 birds per day.

So, the final numerical answer is 64."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. The next step is to take half of the starting value and add it to the starting value. So, half of 20 is 10. Adding 10 to 20 gives us 30.
3. Now, we divide this result by 5. So, 30 divided by 5 is 6.
4. Finally, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Now we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature that would give us 520 degrees when the oven is off by 4%. 

To find the temperature, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = \text{Set Temperature} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Off}}{100}\right) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ 468 = \text{Set Temperature} \times \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) \]
\[ 468 = \text{Set Temperature} \times 1.04 \]

To find the set temperature, we divide 468 by 1.04:
\[ \text{Set Temperature} = \frac{468}{1.04} \approx 450 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 450 degrees to get the actual temperature close to 520 degrees, considering the oven is off by 4%.

The final numerical answer is:
450"
"First, let's convert the time for each movie into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we can calculate the total minutes for the first movie as:

"First, let's find out how much Juan's house is worth. If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we need to calculate 30% of $76,000 and subtract it from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the values of both houses to find the total value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is:

2. **Friend's Purchase:**
   - Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
   - Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. So, the number of dishes Judy's friend brought is \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

3. **Total Number of Utensils:**
   - Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(40 + 12 = 52\) cups.
   - Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(44 + 24 = 68\) dishes.
   - Total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two: \(52 + 68 = 120\).

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's find out how much one box of contacts costs after the discount.

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, Pete buys 2 boxes. The total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Pete will have 180 pairs of contacts. To find out how much each pair costs, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 1.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, the total hours Jill worked is:
2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Jill is paid $10 an hour, so her total earnings are:
3 hours * $10/hour = $30

Now, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked:
1 hour * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday

The total hours John worked is:
4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours

John is also paid $10 an hour, so his total earnings are:
7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Now, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate how many calories Hannah burns doing aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She does aerobics for 2 hours.
- She burns 500 calories per hour.
- So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She runs for 1 hour.
- She burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from aerobics and running:
- Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we know that for every 200 calories burned, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water. So, we need to find out how many 200 calorie units are in 1600 calories:
- Number of 200 calorie units in 1600 calories = 1600 / 200 = 8 units.

Since each 200 calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we need:
- Total water needed = 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue jelly beans.
   - The number of red jelly beans is 1% less than blue jelly beans, so it is \( 0.99B \).
   - The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so it is \( 1.01B \).

2. **Total Jelly Beans:**
   - The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
     \]

3. **Combine Like Terms:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     3B = 4500
     \]

4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
     \]

5. **Calculate the Number of Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Number of red jelly beans:
     \[
     0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
     \]
   - Number of green jelly beans:
     \[
     1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
     \]

6. **Find the Difference Between Green and Red Jelly Beans:**
   - Subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
     \[
     1515 - 1485 = 30

"First, let's find out how much the Dachshund weighs. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Since the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund weighs:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find out how much the Papillon weighs. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs 20 pounds, the Papillon weighs:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we find out how much the Mastiff weighs. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Since the Papillon weighs 5 pounds, the Mastiff weighs:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 220 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping is $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

2. On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon. Since Amazon's shipping is $4, eBay's shipping is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

3. To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, let's think step by step:

1. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.
2. It doubles its height every day.
3. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.
4. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's list the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

We can see that on Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window.

So, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window in 3 days.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much protein is in 100 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein.

2. Next, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams have 3 grams of protein, 200 grams will have twice as much protein. So, 200 grams of mushrooms will have \(3 \times 2 = 6\) grams of protein.

3. Now, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, in a week (7 days) he will eat \(200 \times 7 = 1400\) grams of mushrooms.

4. Since 200 grams of mushrooms have 6 grams of protein, 1400 grams of mushrooms will have \(6 \times \frac{1400}{200} = 6 \times 7 = 42\) grams of protein.

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was X.
2. So, Jerry's current age is X + 5.
3. According to the question, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago. So, X + 5 = 2X.
4. To find X, we solve the equation: X + 5 = 2X.
5. Subtract X from both sides: 5 = X.
6. So, X (Jerry's age 5 years ago) is 5.
7. Therefore, Jerry's current age is 5 + 5 = 10.
8. In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000.
So, the cost for 2 implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500.
So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600.
So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \) degrees.
2. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees.
3. Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.
4. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2x + 3x = 180
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   6x = 180
   \]
6. To find \( x \), divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   x = 30
   \]
7. Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
   - Twice the smallest angle: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees
   - Three times the smallest angle: \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees
8. The largest angle is the one that is three times the smallest angle, which is 90 degrees.

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"First, let's find out how many nickels Colby has. He has 14 nickels. Since each gumball costs a nickel, he can buy 14 gumballs with his nickels.

Now, let's see how many more gumballs he can buy with the other coins he has. He has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, and 15 pennies.

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth:
8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth:
6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents

Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth:
15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents he has:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 275 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs he can buy with 275 cents:
275 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 55 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 55 gumballs in total."
"To find the total number of legs, let's count the legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: Each dog has 4 legs. There are 5 dogs, so 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
- Cats: Each cat has 4 legs. There are 2 cats, so 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
- Birds: Each bird has 2 legs. There are 10 birds, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs:
20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs in total.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out what 50% of the 8-pound weight is. 

50% of 8 pounds is:
\[ \frac{50}{100} \times 8 = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Jamaal increases the weight by 4 pounds:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, Jamaal finds the weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that Jamaal now uses is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break down the problem year by year.

### First Year:
- Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
- He saves up to buy 1 game per month for a year, so he buys 12 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after the first year: 5 (birthday) + 12 (saved up) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games.

### Second Year:
- He starts buying 2 games a month.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after the second year: 22 (from the first year) + 24 (second year) + 5 (Christmas) = 51 games.

### Third Year:
- He buys 4 games a month.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after the third year: 51 (from the second year) + 48 (third year) + 5 (Christmas) = 104 games.

So, the final number of games Steve has after 3 years is 104."
"First, we need to find out the speed of the plane. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for the additional 2000 miles:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find out how much he makes in one hour:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in one hour. So we calculate 3/4 of 60 pounds:

3/4 * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour

Now we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour.

If they work together for 12 hours, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours:

Ruiz's total in 12 hours = 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's total in 12 hours = 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

Now we add the totals together to find the total amount of chocolate they made together:

720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much money Howard spends each day.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

He originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each part of the time he worked and then add them together.

For the first 4 hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, for 4 hours, he sold \(15 \times 4 = 60\) cups.
- The total earnings for these 4 hours are \(60 \times 0.50 = 30\) dollars.

For the next 2 hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, for 2 hours, he sold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) cups.
- The total earnings for these 2 hours are \(20 \times 0.60 = 12\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts of the time:
- Total earnings = Earnings from first 4 hours + Earnings from next 2 hours
- Total earnings = 30 + 12 = 42 dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
42"
"First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in total for Jeremy's monthly driving.

Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, for 400 miles, the tires rotate:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations:
\[ 200 \times 725 = 145000 \text{ rotations} \]

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. Since Jeremy has 4 tires (one for each wheel), the total number of rotations for all 4 tires is:
\[ 10,440,000 \text{ rotations/tire} \times 4 \text{ tires} = 41,760,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it takes for the tires to reach 41,760,000 rotations. Since Jeremy drives 145,000 rotations per month, we need to find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 41,760,000 rotations:
\[ \frac{41,760,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} = 288 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert months to years:
\[ \frac{288 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = 24 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 24 years. Let's write the final answer:

24 years"
"First, we need to find out how many times Jackie can use the shampoo with 1 pump per wash. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, 1 pump will give half as many washes. So, 120 washes / 2 pumps = 60 washes per pump.

The bottle costs $24.00, and we need to find out how much each pump costs in dollars. Since 1 pump gives 60 washes, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. We do this by dividing the total number of washes the bottle can give by the number of washes per pump:

24 washes (total) / 60 washes per pump = 0.4 pumps

Now, to find out how much each pump costs, we divide the total cost of the bottle by the number of pumps:

$24.00 / 0.4 pumps = $60.00 per pump

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1 = 100 cents):

$60.00 * 100 = 6000 cents

So, each pump costs 6000 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.
To find the discount amount on the shirt, we calculate 30% of $25:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{30}{100} \times 25 = 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discount on the shorts:
The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% off sale.
To find the discount amount on the shorts, we calculate 30% of $35:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 35 = \frac{30}{100} \times 35 = 0.30 \times 35 = 10.50 \]

So, the shorts will cost:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from $50:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.
2. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
3. So, to make 4 dozen croissants, he would need 4 times 1/4 pound of butter.

Let's calculate:
4 * 1/4 = 1

So, Juan will need 1 pound of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day.

Now, to find out how much butter he needs for a week (7 days):
1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of repaving both streets and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost to repave per meter is $194.

So, the total cost for Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost to repave per meter is $194.

So, the total cost for Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street:
\[ 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 65760 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
2. The research takes 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, so it takes 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.
3. The first 5 months cost $100,000.
4. The remaining 45 months (50 months total - 5 months initial) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months.

- The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.
- So, the cost for 45 months is $30,000 * 45.

Finally, we add the initial $100,000 to the cost of the remaining 45 months to get the total cost.

Let's do the math:

- Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000
- Cost for the remaining 45 months: $30,000 * 45

Now, let's calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months.
```python
# Initial cost for the first 5 months
initial_cost = 100000

# Cost per month for the remaining months
cost_per_month_remaining = 20000 * 1.5

# Number of remaining months
remaining_months = 45

# Total cost for the remaining months
remaining_cost = cost_per_month_remaining * remaining_months

# Total cost for the entire research
total_cost = initial_cost + remaining_cost
total_cost
```
```output
NameError: name 'cost_per_month_remaining' is not defined
```
It seems there was an error because the variable `cost_per_month_remaining` was not recognized. Let me correct that and calculate the total cost again.

Let's do the calculation step by step:

1. Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000
2. Cost per month for the remaining 45 months: $30,000
3. Total cost for the remaining 45 months: $30,000 * 45
4. Total cost for the entire research: $100,000 + ($30,000 * 45)

Let's calculate this now.
```python
# Recalculating the total cost
# Cost for the first 5 months
initial_cost = 100000

# Cost per month for the remaining months
cost_per_month_remaining = 30000

# Number of remaining months
remaining_months = 45

# Total cost for the remaining months
remaining_cost = cost_per_month_remaining * remaining_months

# Total cost for the entire research
total_cost = initial_cost + remaining_cost
total_cost
```
```output
NameError: name 'cost_per_month_remaining' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the total cost directly:

1. Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000
2. Cost per month for the remaining 45 months: $30,000
3. Total cost for the remaining 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000
4. Total cost for the entire research: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

So, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"Let's break down the meat consumption for each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add up all the meat consumed:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many days are in March and then multiply that by the number of posts each member makes in a day.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts 3 posts per day, so for 1000 members, the total number of posts per day would be:
1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day

Now, to find out the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:
3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93000 posts

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total loads of laundry in a year} = 2 \times 52 = 104 \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so:
\[ \text{Total gallons of water used in a year} = 104 \times 20 = 2080 \text{ gallons} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so:
\[ \text{Total cost of water used in a year} = 2080 \times 0.15 = 312 \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Scarlett bought:

4. The cost of 20 fish is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add up all these costs:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the start, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. After the first week, it doubled in height. So, 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches.
3. After the second week, it grew another 4 inches. So, 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches.
4. After the third week, it didn't grow any more, so it stayed at 10 inches.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"First, let's find out how much meat Prince can sell in one day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. So, the total meat he sells in one day is:

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750kg of meat from the bull. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount he sells in one day:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

So, the final numerical answer is 5 days."
"First, let's find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So we multiply:

4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. So we calculate one-fourth of 72:

72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. So, the number of seats left for others is:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So we calculate one-third of the 54 seats:

54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

This means 18 seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats left for the students is:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the auditorium is 36."
"First, let's calculate the total number of poles at all intersections:
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- There are 4 intersections.

So, the total number of poles is:
6 poles/intersection * 4 intersections = 24 poles

Each pole has 4 street lights, so the total number of street lights is:
24 poles * 4 street lights/pole = 96 street lights

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
96 street lights - 20 street lights = 76 street lights

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, we need to find out how many more times each DVD can be played before it breaks.

For the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has been played 356 times.
- So, the number of times it can still be played is 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

For the second DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has been played 135 times.
- So, the number of times it can still be played is 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
- The first DVD can be played 644 more times.
- The second DVD can be played 865 more times.
- So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played is 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

- John went twice a week.
- Each session was 2 hours long.
So, each week he went to therapy for \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.

Next, we need to find out how many hours he went to therapy in total over 6 weeks:
- He went 4 hours each week.
- He went for 6 weeks.
So, the total hours he went to therapy is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) hours.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. The cost per hour is $125.
- The total cost is the total hours multiplied by the cost per hour.
So, the total cost is \(24 \times 125\).

To find \(24 \times 125\), we can break it down:
- \(24 \times 125 = 24 \times (100 + 25) = (24 \times 100) + (24 \times 25) = 2400 + 600 = 3000\).

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

The final numerical answer is:
3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day is 8 hours long, he chews 1 piece at 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours. So, he chews 3 pieces of gum during school hours.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
4. He chews 1 piece after dinner.
5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed.

Let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim has left after each step:

- After chewing 3 pieces during school, he has 20 - 3 = 17 pieces left.
- After chewing 1 piece on the way home, he has 17 - 1 = 16 pieces left.
- After chewing 1 piece after dinner, he has 16 - 1 = 15 pieces left.
- Now, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives 15 / 2 = 7.5 pieces, but since he can't give half a piece, we'll assume he gives 7 pieces (rounding down). This leaves him with 15 - 7 = 8 pieces.

So, at the end of the day, Jim has 8 pieces of gum left."
"Charmaine is 16 years old in 12 years. To find out how old she is now, we subtract 12 from 16. So, 16 - 12 = 4. This means Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age. So, 4 + 4 = 8.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, we multiply 9 by 3:

9 * 3 = 27

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Now, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, we multiply 8 by 14:

8 * 14 = 112

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

112 - 27 = 85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, let's find out how many flowers Arianna planted in total. She has 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row. So we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to calculate 4/5 of 200:

(4/5) * 200 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final numerical answer is 160."
"First, let's convert Ashley's internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the kb per second by 1000 to get Mb per second.

Ashley's speed in kb per second is 20. So, her speed in Mb per second is:

\[ \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many Mb she gets in an hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour. So, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour.

\[ 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
   - So, for three days, the total number of cars pulled is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Remaining days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday):**
   - On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days.
   - So, the number of cars pulled each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - For three days, the total number of cars pulled is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars pulled in the week:**
   - Adding the cars pulled in the first three days and the remaining three days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 18 \text{ cars} = 48 \text{ cars}
     \]

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is 48."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. 

Adam's height in inches is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 40 by 12 to get Adam's height in feet.

40 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet

The minimum height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. So, we need to find out how many inches Adam needs to grow to reach 4 feet.

4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Now, we convert 0.67 feet to inches because Adam grows in inches per year.

0.67 feet × 12 inches/foot = 8.04 inches

Adam needs to grow 8.04 inches to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by how many inches he grows each year.

8.04 inches ÷ 2 inches/year = 4.02 years

Since Adam can't grow a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number because he needs to be at least 4 feet tall.

So, Adam needs to wait 5 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final numerical answer is 5 years."
"First, let's find out how much James sold the cars for. He sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.

So, the total amount he got from selling the cars is:
10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the cost for the company to get the cars is:
30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

Now, let's find out the profit James made. The profit is the total amount he got from selling the cars minus the cost the company paid to get the cars:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, the final numerical answer is:
$17,500"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Out of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, we find the number of women:

60% of 25 riders = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

Since the rest of the riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders that can stay upright:

25 riders - 15 women = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Since a diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000

Now, let's calculate this:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000 = 800 * 4 = $3200

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. So:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $3200 - $400 = $2800

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels:
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $3200
- Silver jewel: $2800

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $3200 + $2800 = $8000

So, the total price for all three jewels is $8000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add up all the stamps:

- Snowflake stamps: 16
- Truck stamps: 19
- Rose stamps: 10

Total stamps = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance Bob is ahead**: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
2. **Speeds**: Bob drives at 55 miles per hour, and Tom drives at 70 miles per hour.
3. **Relative speed**: To catch up, Tom needs to close the 75-mile gap. The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour.
4. **Time to catch up**: To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at a relative speed of 15 miles per hour, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

17 (Naomi's fish) - 6 = 11 fish

Now, we know Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

11 (Darren's fish) + 3 = 14 fish

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's find out how much each class costs on average if Manny misses some classes. We know that the total cost is $60 for 10 classes. So, if Manny misses some classes, the total cost will be higher.

Let's assume Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he takes \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class will be higher because the total cost of $60 is spread over fewer classes.

The cost per class if Manny misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

According to the parents, if the cost per class is more than $10, they won't sign him up again. So, we need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Let's solve this inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers}
   \]

2. Now, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers a day and Julie processes 100 customers a day. So, together they process:
   \[
   50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers a day}
   \]

3. To find out how many customers they process in a week, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days):
   \[
   150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers}
   \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles.
Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To solve this, let's first find out how much one apple and one orange cost.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost:
- 5 apples cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
- 5 oranges cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

So, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final numerical answer is:
$12.00"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many cubic feet the hole is. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. So, we multiply these three numbers together:
   \[
   6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. Next, we know it takes 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:
   \[
   72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
$7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $13,500

Now, add the base price of the truck to the total extra costs:
$30,000 (base price) + $13,500 (extra costs) = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the raise.

Tim's original salary is $20000 a month. A 5% raise means he gets an extra 5% of $20000.

5% of $20000 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{5}{100} \times 20000 = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, Tim gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half a month's salary is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly salary including the bonus is:
\[ 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):
\[ 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 372000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \( 10 \times 750 = 7500 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- So, the cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- So, the total cost for the dress pants is \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- So, the total cost for the dress shirts is \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of suits: $7500
- Cost of dress pants: $1500
- Cost of dress shirts: $1800
- Total cost: \( 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \) dollars.

So, the total cost is 10800 dollars."

First, let's calculate the number of articles the news website publishes in February:
- The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles the news website publishes in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of articles the sister company publishes in February:
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles the sister company publishes in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:

"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since Steve is 60 years old and his wife is 4 years older, we add 4 to Steve's age:

60 + 4 = 64

So, Steve's wife is 64 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Steve's son is. Since his son is half as old as his mom, we divide his mom's age by 2:

64 / 2 = 32

So, Steve's son is 32 years old.

Finally, we need to find out how old Steve's son's wife is. Since Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than his husband, we subtract 3 from Steve's son's age:

32 - 3 = 29

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

So, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil and the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet of soil per hour.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

To find the time, we divide the total feet of soil by the rate of digging:
\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half the rate of soil through clay, so he digs 2 feet of clay per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

To find the time, we divide the total feet of clay by the rate of digging:
\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."

27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many likes Fishio had after three weeks. We know that after one week, she had 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we calculate:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, Fishio had 140,000 likes. Now, if she received 20,000 more likes recently, we add these to the 140,000 likes she had after three weeks:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes Fishio has now is:

\[ 160000 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400

She got $2 off because of the voucher.
So, the final cost for Clara on Tuesday is:
$400 - $2 = $398

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
So, the discount amount is:
10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60

The final cost for Sheila after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.

The difference is:
$540 (Sheila's final cost) - $398 (Clara's final cost) = $142

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats because the sales from red hats were half the sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - The total sales in two months were the sum of the sales in the first and second months.
   - Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 2100."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total.
2. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. The first hour is $15.
4. Each hour after that is twice the cost of the first hour, so the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, let's add up the cost for the 3 hours he pays for:

- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how much money Sally has in her bank account at the end of the week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full wage.
3. The result will be the amount withheld from her wage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
2. If Sally had received her full wage of $300, her bank account would have been $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $520.
3. But her bank account only has $420.
4. So, the amount withheld is $520 (what it should be) - $420 (what it is) = $100.

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $100.

Since 2 deviled egg halves make 1 whole egg, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 halves:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2"
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we do:

15 pages * 1/3 = 5 pages

Mike will finish his reading 20 days before the deadline."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts:

1. **Cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly rent for the hanger**: $5000
3. **Monthly cost for fuel**: Twice the rent, so $5000 * 2 = $10,000
4. **Total monthly cost**: Rent + Fuel = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000
5. **Total cost for the first year**: $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000

Now, let's add the cost of the plane to the total yearly cost of renting and fueling it:

- Cost of the plane: $150,000
- Total yearly cost of renting and fueling: $180,000

So, the total cost for the first year is: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how long it took to cook pork. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice. So:

Cooking time for pork = Cooking time for rice + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 50 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it took to cook beans. It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, let's find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:

Combined cooking time of pork and rice = Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for rice
Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes + 30 minutes
Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 80 minutes

Now, we can find the cooking time for beans:

Cooking time for beans = Half of the combined cooking time of pork and rice
Cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2
Cooking time for beans = 40 minutes

Finally, we add up the cooking times for all the food:

Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

So, it took 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the almonds and walnuts for each mixture.

For the first mixture:
- Almonds cost $10 per pound, so for 1/2 pound, it would cost $10 * 1/2 = $5.
- Walnuts cost $15 per pound, so for 1/3 pound, it would cost $15 * 1/3 = $5.
- So, the total cost for the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture:
- Almonds cost $10 per pound, so for 1/5 pound, it would cost $10 * 1/5 = $2.
- Walnuts cost $15 per pound, so for 1/3 pound, it would cost $15 * 1/3 = $5.
- So, the total cost for the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The first mixture costs $10.
- The second mixture costs $7.
- So, the difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final numerical answer is $3."
"To solve this problem, let's think about the number of legs and heads for each type of animal.

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's assume:
- \( S \) is the number of sheep.
- \( G \) is the number of geese.

From the information given:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write two equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Now, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 in total.

He bought:
- 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, so 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Now, subtract the total cost of these items from the total amount spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, we do the following calculation:

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered in a day - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Let's do the math:

600 - 198 - 209 = 293

So, James delivers 293 newspapers to District B.

The final numerical answer is 293."
"First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the number of hours John attends per week is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours John attends over the 6 weeks is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many new recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, the number of recipes he learns is:

"First, let's find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we can do the following calculation:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia: $120
- Kassidy: $90
- Rayna: $150

To find out how much money they would have if they added together their money and shared it equally, we first add their money:

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

If they share this total equally among the three of them, each person would get:

Money each person gets = Total money / 3
Money each person gets = $360 / 3
Money each person gets = $120

So, the final numerical answer is $120."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Christina had a total of 30 days.
2. Out of these, 12 days were good, 8 days were bad, and the rest were neutral.
3. We need to find out how many neutral days there were. Since 12 + 8 = 20, the number of neutral days is 30 - 20 = 10.
4. We are told that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the last 8 days were neutral.
5. The next three days were good, neutral, and good.
6. We need to find out how many good days are left in the month.

Let's count the good days:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know Janey has 21 books.
2. The problem states that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. We can write this as an equation: Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3.
3. We can substitute the number of books Janey has into the equation: 21 = 2 * Sally's books + 3.
4. To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve for Sally's books. First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 21 - 3 = 2 * Sally's books.
5. This simplifies to: 18 = 2 * Sally's books.
6. Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find out how many books Sally has: 18 ÷ 2 = Sally's books.
7. This gives us: 9 = Sally's books.

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches.

The bamboo grows 30 inches a day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The difference in height needed is 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

If the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, then the number of days required to grow 360 inches is 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

So, the final answer is 12 days."
"First, let's figure out how many toys James needs for the dogs he currently has.

James has 4 dogs and he has 4 toys. So, he needs 4 more toys for the 4 dogs.

Now, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, he needs 8 more toys for these 8 dogs.

So far, James needs 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, there were 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. So, twice as many more dogs means 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs.

James had to buy some more toys for these 24 dogs. So, he needs 24 more toys.

Now, let's add all the toys together:
12 (for the first 4 dogs) + 8 (for the next 8 dogs) + 24 (for the 24 dogs) = 44 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 44."

640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies. So, if we add 5 to 68, we get the number of cookies Max has:

68 + 5 = 73

So, Max has 73 cookies.

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if we subtract 12 from 73, we get the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:

73 - 12 = 61

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if we add 23 to 73, we get the number of cookies Summer has:

73 + 23 = 96

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

To find out the total number of cookies they all have, we add the number of cookies each person has:

Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + the Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies = Total cookies

68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so she adds \( 0.5x \) cm to the original length.
3. She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with lace trim.
4. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

So, the equation for the final length of the dress is:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's call the age of one twin T and the age of one triplet T. So, the other twin is also T, and the other two triplets are also T.

2. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. So, if we take the age of one triplet as T, then the age of the twin is T + 7.

3. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. So, we can write the equation:
   T (one twin) + T (other twin) + T (one triplet) + T (other triplet) = 44
   4T = 44

4. To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
   T = 44 ÷ 4

Now we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now we know that one candy costs $0.30. So, the cost of ten lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of ten candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for ten lollipops and ten candies is:

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). So, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one banana and one orange cost.

- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.
- One orange costs three times as much as one banana, so one orange costs $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.

- The cost for 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
- The cost for 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
- The cost for 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Adding these costs together, the total price for one crate of fruit is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

So, the final numerical answer is $32."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color there are:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:

14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is the same as the total number of squares.

So, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know that there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.

So, the number of regular chairs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we add the high chairs and the regular chairs to find the total number of chairs Mia currently has:
\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. So, the total number of people attending is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the number of people attending:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"First, let's find out how many deer are bucks. If 50 percent of the deer are bucks, then:

50% of 50 deer = 0.50 * 50 = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. If 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, then:

20% of 25 bucks = 0.20 * 25 = 5 bucks

So, there are 5 bucks that are 8 points.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's find out how many points each person has collected.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
30% of 50 = 0.30 * 50 = 15
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points. So, Marta has:
3 * 30 = 90 points.

Now, let's add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, and Marta:
Adam: 50 points
Betty: 65 points
Marta: 90 points

Total points collected by Adam, Betty, and Marta = 50 + 65 + 90 = 205 points.

Tom has 30 points.

So, the total points collected by the class is:
205 (Adam, Betty, and Marta) + 30 (Tom) = 235 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:
400 - 235 = 165 points.

The final numerical answer is 165."

"First, let's find out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account. 

50% of $2400.00 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{50}{100} \times 2400 = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, Greta puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

20% of $2400.00 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{20}{100} \times 2400 = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, Greta uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and the amount she used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

Total paycheck: $2400.00
Amount for retirement: $1200.00
Amount for car payment: $480.00

Money left to spend:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720 left to spend."
"First, let's understand the question. The box can hold 20 pencils. If 4 pencils are missing, that means there are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils in the box.

A pair of pencils means 2 pencils. To find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we divide the number of pencils by 2.

So, 16 pencils ÷ 2 = 8 pairs of pencils.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the display:

15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

3 boxes of 5 fireworks each:
3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

Now, let's add the fireworks from the display and the backyard to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

300 (from the display) + 15 (from her backyard) = 315 fireworks

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 315."
"First, let's find out how many people are going to the cinema. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20 people

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Drinks and snacks cost $2 each.

So, each person needs:
- 1 seat
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

The cost for each person is:
- 1 seat: $2
- 2 drinks: 2 * $2 = $4
- 3 snacks: 3 * $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the cost for one person:
$2 (seat) + $4 (drinks) + $6 (snacks) = $12

Since there are 20 people, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:
20 * $12 = $240

So, the group has spent $240 overall on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's find out how much Gordy's truck can haul. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we add 800 pounds to that:

4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

So, Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that when Gissela, Gordy, and Gary bring their trucks together, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We already know how much Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul, so we can find out how much Gary's truck can haul by subtracting the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the combined total capacity.

Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds
Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds
Gary's truck: ?

Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

Now, subtract this from the total capacity of all three trucks:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final numerical answer is 2,800."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
3 dumplings/female * 6 females = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
4 dumplings/male * 8 males = 32 dumplings

Now, to find the total number of dumplings cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to find out how much money Gerald and Julia each got from the $100.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

To find out how much each part is worth, we divide $100 by 5:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, each part is worth $20.

Now, we can find out how much money Gerald got:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gerald had $60. If he spent $10 on a book, we subtract that from his total:
\[ 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. So, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We multiply the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:
120"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The firefighters' goal is to raise $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. To find out how much they need to raise to reach their goal, we subtract the amount they've raised from the goal:
   $6300 - $2100 = $4200
4. They need to raise $4200 more.
5. We need to find out how many hours it will take to raise $4200 if they raise an equal amount each hour. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, they raise $700 each hour ($2100 ÷ 3 = $700).
6. To find out how many hours it will take to raise $4200 at $700 per hour, we divide $4200 by $700:
   $4200 ÷ $700 = 6

So, they have to raise for a total of 6 hours to reach their goal.

The final numerical answer is 6 hours."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of the 40% used by Colorado City, 80% is used for industrial purposes.
3. We need to find out what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

To find the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by Colorado City.

So, we calculate:
\[ 40\% - 80\% \text{ of } 40\% \]

First, calculate 80% of 40%:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40\% = 0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Now, subtract this from the total 40%:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final numerical answer is:
8%"

2. Alex charges $12 per day.
3. So, for one week, she charges \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \) dollars.
4. For 2 weeks, she charges \( 84 \times 2 = 168 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 168."
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes in one hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours
- So, in 1 hour, they make 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours
- So, in 1 hour, they make 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Now, we need to find out how much ice cream they can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Now, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together:
- 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

So, the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the pastries:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 scoop for free. So, for every 3 scoops, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50.

Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops she can get, we need to divide her money by the cost of one scoop and then figure out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get.

Let's calculate:
$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 sets of 3 scoops.

So, Erin can get 4 sets of 3 scoops, which means she can get 4 * 3 = 12 scoops of ice cream.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks there are 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days she eats:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Ginger started with 100 pieces, so after eating 56 pieces, she has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces

Now, let's find out how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days she eats:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Amy started with 100 pieces, so after eating 42 pieces, she has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."

"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries. He had to pay a flat fee of $20 and an additional $1.5 for each pound he picked. He picked 30 pounds.

So, the cost for the pounds of blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost James to buy the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound.

So, the cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes when she is dancing with both hands at her sides.

She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 5 minutes, the total number of taps when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 550 \times 5 = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she makes when she raises her arms.

When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps when her arms are raised is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the number of taps from both scenarios to get the combined total number of taps:
\[ 2750 + 800 = 3550 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

1. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
2. Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

Total cost = Fine + Cost of asphalt
Total cost = $120 + $75 = $195

The damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the damage to his car.

Money saved = Damage - Total cost
Money saved = $450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left after 20 of them were sent to the carpenter. The restaurant originally had 170 normal chairs, so:

170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left after 13 of them were sent to the carpenter. The restaurant originally had 23 baby chairs, so:

23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, let's add the number of normal chairs left and the number of baby chairs left to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:

150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs in total.

So, the final numerical answer is 160."
"First, let's figure out how many slices of pizza each person ate.

Bryce and his two friends each ordered one pizza, so that's 3 pizzas in total. Each pizza has 12 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, each of these 3 people ate 2/3 of 12 slices.

2/3 of 12 slices is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

So, each of the 3 people ate 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So, each of these 2 people ate 3/4 of 12 slices.

3/4 of 12 slices is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

So, each of the 2 people ate 9 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices eaten by all four people:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 3 pizzas, the total number of slices is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ slices} \]

The number of slices left is:
\[ 36 - 42 = -6 \]

Since it's not possible to have a negative number of slices, it means that the friends ate more slices than were available. So, the correct answer is that there are no slices left, and they actually owe 6 slices. But the question asks for the number of slices left, which is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

So, the time it takes the dog is:
\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2.

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} \]

Substituting the times we have:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches. Topher's shoe is 8-feet and 4-inches long. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we can convert the feet to inches:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now add the 4 inches:

96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

So Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

According to the question, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Let's confirm this by checking the equation:

\[ 9 \times 10 + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation checks out. Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Next, we calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the windows.
- So, the number of windows she smashes in the students' cars is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three quarters of the windows.
- So, the number of windows she smashes in the teachers' cars is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = \(64 + 48 = 112\).

So, the final numerical answer is 112."
"To solve this, let's first find out the total number of spools Candy has.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Now, we need to find out how many of these are blue. Blue spools are light blue and dark blue.

Number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40%."
"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we can calculate this as follows:

\( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. This means the remaining number of people who hadn't voted by midday is:

\( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \)

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, we calculate 2/3 of the 3000 people who hadn't voted by midday:

\( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

So, 2000 people had voted by 16:00. To find out how many people hadn't voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the number of people who hadn't voted by midday:

\( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \)

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate how many pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
   - Parker chews 4 pieces a day.
   - So in 30 days, he will chew \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) pieces of gum.

2. Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need for 120 pieces.
   - Each pack has 15 pieces.
   - So, the number of packs needed is \( \frac{120}{15} = 8 \) packs.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's find out how many smores are needed in total.

Each kid wants 2 smores and there are 9 kids, so:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores for kids

Each adult will eat 1 smore and there are 6 adults, so:
6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores for adults

Now, let's add the smores for kids and adults:
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores in total

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. So, to find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

So, the final numerical answer is 1 box."
"First, let's find out how old Dora's father is. We know Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.

Twice Dora's age is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \).

Eight more than twice Dora's age is \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Dora's mother is. We know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.

Dora's father is 38 years old, so Dora's mother is \( 38 - 4 = 34 \) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Dora's age is 15, her father's age is 38, and her mother's age is 34.

So, the total combined age is \( 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \).

The final numerical answer is 87."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people.

- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice as much as her English book, so 2 * 3 pounds = 6 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights:

2 (math) + 2 (science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (History) = 17 pounds

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. So, 20% of 100 voters is:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A. So, we need to add 50% of candidate A's votes to candidate A's votes:
\[ 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]
\[ \text{Candidate B's votes} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We have already calculated that candidate A got 20 votes and candidate B got 30 votes. So, the number of votes candidate C got is:
\[ \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for A} - \text{Votes for B} = 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris will have:

Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck = 100 - 10
Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck = 90

And Beck will have:

Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris = 77 + 10
Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris = 87

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now:

Fewer apples = Boris's apples - Beck's apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate how much water Peter uses for each type of cube:

- For giant cubes: 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
- For medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- For small cubes: 8 small cubes * 1/2 ounce per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water left is:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

The final numerical answer is 2 ounces."
"First, let's find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can divide Clara's books by 2 to find Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find out how many books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's books:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books:

\[ \text{More books Clara has than Alice} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there are 80 students in total in two classes.
2. Each class has the same number of students. So, if we divide the total number of students by 2, we get the number of students in each class:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students in each class}
   \]
3. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. So, 60% of the students are boys (because 100% - 40% = 60%).
4. To find out how many boys are in each class, we calculate 60% of 40 students:
   \[
   0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ boys in each class}

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each.

\[
3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

So, Mark spent $5400 on the packs.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he got. He got 1 card worth $4000, 1 card worth $1000, and 30 cards worth an average of $50 each.

The value of the 1 card worth $4000 is $4000.

The value of the 1 card worth $1000 is $1000.

The value of the 30 cards worth an average of $50 each is:

\[
30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, let's add up the total value of all the cards:

\[
4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500

Mark's profit is the total value of the cards minus the cost of the packs:

\[
6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

So, Mark made a profit of $1100."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at $26 each is: 2 * $26 = $52
- The cost for 2 children at $12 each is: 2 * $12 = $24
- So, the total cost for the first amusement park is: $52 + $24 = $76

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at $14 each is: 2 * $14 = $28
- The cost for 2 children at $10 each is: 2 * $10 = $20
- So, the total cost for the second amusement park is: $28 + $20 = $48

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:

So, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"First, let's find out how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $.5 each and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, let's find out how much money he spends on tomatoes a day with his new vendor. The new vendor sells them for $.4 each. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves a day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:

\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much money he saves in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily savings by 7:

"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Next, let's find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

Sean's marbles = 1/2 * Cal's marbles
56 = 1/2 * Cal's marbles
Cal's marbles = 56 * 2
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button is worth one small sticker, so she gets 27 small stickers.
   - Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - So, 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.
   - Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left and 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are worth 20 small buttons.
   - Now, Lorraine has 20 small buttons from the large stickers and the 27 small buttons she already had, making a total of 20 + 27 = 47 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons and 47 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.
   - Adding the small buttons she already has, she has 47 + 60 = 107 small buttons in total.

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 107."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \) (twice as many as against).
3. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
4. We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so \( 3x = 33 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide 33 by 3: \( x = 33 / 3 = 11 \).
6. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), so it is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(18 / 2 = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, to find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add up all the students needing each size:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22

Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, the number of people who think horse #7 will win is:

\( 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \)

Now, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people to find out how many think horse #12 will win:

\( 40 - 24 = 16 \)

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, if 6 is one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is 6 * 3 = 18.

2. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of all the puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up a proportion. If 18 is two thirds, then 1 (which is one third) would be 18 / 2 = 9. So, 18 is two thirds, and 18 * 3 = 54 would be the whole (all puppies).

So, Jana has 54 puppies in total."
"Jayden originally had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so the amount Jayden still needs is $200 - $115 = $85.

The final numerical answer is:
$85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

Now, we know the total number of cases for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2/5:

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half of the second house, the first house needs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the third house needs:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many more pears George has than bananas. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we calculate 45% of 200 bananas:

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = \frac{45}{100} \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Now, let's add the number of bananas to the number of pears to find the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 200 + 200 + 90 = 490 \]

So, George has 490 fruits in total."

"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed must have read half of that. So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we know that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra read. So, 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books) = 600 books.

The final numerical answer is 600."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

### Monday:
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day.
- So, she earns an extra $5.
- Total for Monday: \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

### Wednesday:
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she doesn't get the extra $5 per day.
- Total for Wednesday: \(30\) dollars.

### Total for two days:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend:
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
Total weekend hours = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract the reading time from the total weekend hours:
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

We subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she has left for soccer:
Time left for soccer = 9 - 3 = 6 hours

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the weekend she spends playing soccer. We know she has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so the total weekend time is 12 hours. The percentage of time spent on soccer is calculated as follows:
Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Time spent on soccer / Total weekend time) * 100
Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

"First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum and back.

Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back. He drives at a speed of 75 mph.

The time taken to drive one way (to the museum) is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed:
\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives the same distance back, the time for the return trip is also 2 hours.

So, the total driving time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (to museum)} + 2 \text{ hours (back)} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 600 movies in total.

1. A third of the movies are in various series. So, the number of series movies is:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200
   \]
   These series movies can be bought for $6 each.

2. The remaining movies are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
   40% of these remaining movies are older movies. So, the number of older movies is:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]
   These older movies cost $5 each.

3. The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies. So, the number of normal movies is:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240
   \]
   These normal movies cost $10 each.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of movie:
- Cost of series movies: \(200 \times 6 = 1200\)
- Cost of older movies: \(160 \times 5 = 800\)
- Cost of normal movies: \(240 \times 10 = 2400\)

Finally, the total cost to replace all the movies is:

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type:

- Cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00
- Cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00
- Cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Winston spent:

Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total cost = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours
Distance driven = 300 miles

Next, let's find out how fast they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
5 miles per hour less than that = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Now, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 300 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 330 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so Ava finishes in \( T + 4 \) seconds.

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

Emma's score:
- For every enemy she jumps on, she gets 10 points.
- For every berry she collects, she gets 5 points.
- For every second left on the timer, she gets 30 points.

So, Emma's score is:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Ava's score:
- For every enemy she jumps on, she gets 10 points.
- For every berry she collects, she gets 5 points.
- For every second left on the timer, she gets 30 points.

So, Ava's score is:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T + 4) \]

Let's simplify Ava's score:
\[ 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T + 215 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T + 215) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T + 215 - 10E - 5B - 30T \]
\[ 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:

"Let's break down the question step by step:

1. Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on 5 days.
   - So, for 5 days, they ride \(3 \times 5 = 15\) times.

2. On the other 2 days, they ride twice as many times as they do on the usual days.
   - On usual days, they ride 3 times a day, so on these special days, they ride \(3 \times 2 = 6\) times a day.
   - For 2 days, they ride \(6 \times 2 = 12\) times.

3. Now, let's add the times from both types of days:
   - From the usual days: 15 times
   - From the special days: 12 times
   - Total times: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

"First, let's understand the situation. Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He got 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding them, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \). So, \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + W \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we have the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

1. From the first equation, we know:
\[ O + W = 17 \]
So, \( O = 17 - W \).

2. Substitute \( O = 17 - W \) into the second equation:
\[ 3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W) \]
\[ 20 - W = 8 + 2W \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2W + W \]
\[ 12 = 3W \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find out how many orange fish he bought, we use the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, if Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish, the total number of fish he added is 17. After adding these fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \). Since 16 is twice 8, the condition of the problem is satisfied.

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. He goes to work from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days. If the one-way distance is 5 miles, then the round trip (home to work and back) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. So, in a week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses to drive 50 miles. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas in a week.

Finally, we need to calculate how much money Andy spends on gas in a week. If the price of gas is $3/gallon, then for 5 gallons, he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, the final numerical answer is $15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the total amount of money in quarters as follows:

140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, we can calculate the total amount of money in twenties as follows:

10 twenties * $20/twenty = $200

Now, let's calculate how much money Carrie spent on the lunch. She spent 3/5 of the twenties, so we calculate:

3/5 * $200 = $120

She also spent all 140 quarters, which we already calculated as $35.

Now, let's add the amount spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount spent for lunch:

$120 + $35 = $155

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is $155."
"First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes Ricardo can get from the tomato plants. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. So, we multiply the number of tomato plants by the number of tomatoes each plant yields:

"First, let's find out how cold it gets at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature like this:

45 degrees (day) - 33 degrees = 12 degrees (night)

Now, we know that the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The night temperature is 12 degrees, which is below 32 degrees. So, Carson needs to raise the temperature to 32 degrees or above to prevent the pipes from freezing.

To find out how many degrees Carson needs to raise the temperature, we subtract the night temperature from 32 degrees:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total degrees needed by the degrees each log provides:

20 degrees ÷ 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

3/5 × 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. So we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back:

6 × 2 = 12 seashells

So, the total number of seashells they brought is 12."

"First, let's find out how much Jamie earns for her regular 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour for these hours.

\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours she worked. She worked a total of 11 hours, so the additional hours are:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to calculate her pay for the additional hours. Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. First, we find 150% of $20:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 150\% \times \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Earnings for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings to her earnings for the additional hours to find her total earnings for the day:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work that day."
"First, let's find out how many male lions there are. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Since there are 12 female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

12 female lions / 2 = 6 male lions

Now, we add up all the lions:
- 12 female lions
- 6 male lions
- 14 lion cubs

12 + 6 + 14 = 32

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"First, let's find out how much the jeans are discounted. The original price is $40.00 and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00.

25% of $40.00 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the jeans are now $10.00 cheaper. The new price of the jeans is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the price of the jeans from $50.00.

\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20.00 left over."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **New employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Total employees after 1 month**: 200 + 20 = 220
4. **Total employees after 2 months**: 220 + 20 = 240
5. **Total employees after 3 months**: 240 + 20 = 260

Now, we need to calculate the total salary paid to all employees after 3 months. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

6. **Total salary for 3 months for 260 employees**:
   - First, calculate the total salary for one employee for 3 months: $4000 * 3 = $12000
   - Then, calculate the total salary for all 260 employees: $12000 * 260 = $3120000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3120000."
"First, we need to find out how long ""Deck the Halls"" is repeated. It is repeated twice, so we multiply the length of one song by 2:

150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

Next, we add the length of ""Jingle Bells"" to the total:

300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's starting salary:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - So, his final salary is $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

2. **Billy's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - If Billy works 20 hours at $11.50 per hour, his total earnings are:
     \[
     20 \times 11.50 = 230 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, we need to find out Sally's starting salary.

3. **Sally's starting salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is:
     \[
     10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

4. **Sally's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - If Sally works 20 hours at $10.50 per hour, her total earnings are:
     \[
     20 \times 10.50 = 210 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Difference in earnings:**
   - To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:
     \[
     230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf costs $2.
- So, 3 loaves cost 3 * $2 = $6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- So, 2 bagels cost 2 * $1 = $2.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:
- The cost of 3 loaves of bread is $6.
- The cost of 2 bagels is $2.
- So, $6 - $2 = $4.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's score is:
278 / 2 = 139

Then, Nikita scored 11 more than this:
139 + 11 = 150

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428

The final numerical answer is 428."
"First, let's find out how many students and teachers there are in total at Ashley's school.

There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Each class also has an average of 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the trees planted by the students and the trees planted by the teachers to find the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles already has. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

To find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has, we add these numbers together:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Now, let's assume Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This means that the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can write this as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first expand the right side of the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

Half an hour is 0.5 hours.

So, for 2 weeks, Kris has played:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week.

So, for 1 week, Kris has played:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours Kris has already played:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the total cost of the ring before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost is:

$600 + $300 = $900

Now, James pays a 30% premium on the total cost. To find out how much the premium is, we calculate 30% of $900:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

So, the premium is $270. To find out the total amount James paid, we add the premium to the total cost:

Total cost + Premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

For fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40 or 40%.

For fifth graders:
The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so it's 2 * 40% = 80%.

Now, let's add up the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.

Total students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.
Total students who passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 780 students.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

Overall pass rate = (780 / 1000) * 100 = 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has two bags, and each bag holds 72 chips.

So, 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Now, we know that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed per square inch.

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total square inches by the height in inches.

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea drunk by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea drunk by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
12"
"Dale originally had 100 candies and sold 150, but he ordered 100 more. So, he now has:

100 (original) - 150 (sold) + 100 (new order) = 50 candies.

To find out how many more he needs to sell to have all his candy, we subtract the number of candies he still has from the total he ordered:

150 (total ordered) - 50 (candies he still has) = 100.

So, Dale still needs to sell 100 candies to sell all of his candy."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.
2. By the end of the first month, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
3. By the end of the second month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
4. By the end of the third month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
5. By the end of the fourth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
6. By the end of the fifth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- At the beginning of the year, there were 10 students.
- By the end of May, there are 320 students.

So, the number of additional students that joined is 320 - 10 = 310.

The final numerical answer is 310."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Felix charges $.25 for each branch he climbs.
2. He made $105 during the week.

First, we need to find out how many branches he climbed in total. We do this by dividing the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Now, Felix worked for a week, which has 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed on average per day, we divide the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks:

1. She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. She picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picks:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 flower with 5 petals.
- She drops 1 flower with 6 petals.
- She drops 1 flower with 4 petals.
- She drops 1 flower with 7 petals.

So, she drops a total of:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ petals}

"First, let's find out how many marshmallows John and DeSean used to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and each S'more uses one marshmallow, so John uses 9 marshmallows.
DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows too.

Together, they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so they have 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left for each kid.

John and DeSean together used 18 marshmallows, so the remaining marshmallows are 32 - 18 = 14 marshmallows.

Since they want to share the remaining marshmallows equally, each kid gets 14 ÷ 2 = 7 marshmallows.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"First, let's understand the game rules and how long each person can play:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
- Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so 10 minutes each with 1 quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so 30 minutes each with 1 quarter.

Now, let's calculate how long they all play together:

- Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
- Two friends play for 10 minutes each, so together they play for 20 minutes.
- One friend plays for 30 minutes.

So, the total time they play together is:
240 minutes (Jack) + 20 minutes (two friends) + 30 minutes (one friend) = 290 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many quarters they use. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play:

- Jack uses 290 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 14.5 quarters.
- Two friends each use 20 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 1 quarter each.
- One friend uses 30 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 1.5 quarters.

So, the total number of quarters used is:
14.5 quarters (Jack) + 1 quarter (first friend) + 1 quarter (second friend) + 1.5 quarters (third friend) = 18 quarters.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Tanya uses \( x \) ounces of salt.
2. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses \( 2x \) ounces of oil.
3. She uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, so let's say she uses \( x \) ounces of fragrance and \( x \) ounces of citrus zest.
4. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she uses \( x \) ounces of sugar.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients:
- Salt: \( x \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2x \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( x \) ounces
- Citrus zest: \( x \) ounces
- Sugar: \( x \) ounces

The total amount of ingredients is:
\[ x + 2x + x + x + x = 6x \]

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ 6x = 10 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find out how many ounces of oil she uses. Since she uses \( 2x \) ounces of oil:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the number of ounces of oil she uses is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

So, the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

So, the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

So, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[ 4500 \]"

"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 0.2 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother is:

\[ 16 \]

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say PJ has x cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of cards:

x (PJ's cards) + 3x (Smendrick's cards) + 3x + 12 (Becca's cards) = 341

Combining like terms:

x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341
7x + 12 = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

7x = 341 - 12
7x = 329
x = 329 / 7
x = 47

So, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, which is 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final numerical answer is 153."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.
3. She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs.
4. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.

Let's calculate the number of each color of eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 2 times the green eggs = 2 * 5 = 10
- Pink eggs: 1 fewer than the blue eggs = 10 - 1 = 9
- Yellow eggs: 1/3 as many as the pink eggs = 9 / 3 = 3

Now, let's add them all up to find the total number of eggs:

5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

So, the total number of eggs Cindy has is 27."
"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35 \text{ per pound} = \$1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08 \text{ per mile} = \$1.60 \]

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Amazon will refund. The book cost $32, and they will refund 75% of the purchase price:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Milly will lose. This is the cost of the book minus the refund plus the shipping cost:
\[ \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, Milly will lose:
\[ \$11.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$11.00 \]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Therefore, the money left with her is $140 - $80 = $60.

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate how many bars he produces in the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First, we know Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so:
\[ \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we add up the production from the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

To find out how many bars he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week.

She records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes per video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends doing her makeup each week. She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup each week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes per day} \times 6 \text{ days per week} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add up the total time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes on TikTok videos} + 120 \text{ minutes on songs} + 90 \text{ minutes on makeup} = 282 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time she spends on TikTok-related activities in a month is:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{1128} \]"
"First, let's break down the cost of the items Angela needs:

- She needs 6 mirrors, and the firm charges $129.00 for 4 mirrors. So, for 6 mirrors, it will cost $129.00 * (6/4) = $129.00 * 1.5 = $193.50.
- She needs 2 chandeliers, and the firm charges $129.00 for 1 chandelier. So, for 2 chandeliers, it will cost $129.00 * 2 = $258.00.
- She needs 20 pictures, and the firm charges $129.00 for 10 pictures. So, for 20 pictures, it will cost $129.00 * (20/10) = $129.00 * 2 = $258.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of the items she needs:
$193.50 (mirrors) + $258.00 (chandeliers) + $258.00 (pictures) = $609.50.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for additional items. Angela needs 2 more mirrors and 2 more chandeliers:
- For 2 more mirrors, it will cost $15.00 * 2 = $30.00.
- For 2 more chandeliers, it will cost $15.00 * 2 = $30.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the additional items:
$30.00 (additional mirrors) + $30.00 (additional chandeliers) = $60.00.

Finally, let's add the cost of the items she needs and the cost of the additional items:
$609.50 (items she needs) + $60.00 (additional items) = $669.50.

So, the total cost for Angela will be $669.50."
"First, let's find out how much money Eva has saved. Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we know Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[ 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more 40% of Anthony's savings is, we calculate 40% of $30.00:
\[ 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]
So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony.

To find out how much money Roy has saved in total, we add this amount to Anthony's savings:
\[ 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]

So, Roy has saved $42.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42.00 \]"
"First, let's figure out how high each person can lift a mountain step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Now, to convert 480 inches to feet, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, we divide 480 inches by 12:

\[ 480 \div 12 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he travels 8 * 4 = 32 miles. Then he travels for another 6 hours, so he travels 8 * 6 = 48 miles. In total, he has traveled 32 + 48 = 80 miles."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

We need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles to travel the same distance.

Let's break it down:
- If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then the total distance they travel is \(3 \text{ kangaroos} \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours}\).
- This means the total distance is 54 kangaroo-hours.

Now, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, then:
- 1 turtle would take twice as long as a kangaroo to cover the same distance.
- So, 1 turtle would take \(18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours}\) to cover the distance.

Since we have 4 turtles, the total time taken by 4 turtles to cover the same distance would be:
- \(4 \text{ turtles} \times 36 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ turtle-hours}\).

But since the distance is the same, we can directly calculate the time for 4 turtles:
- Since 1 turtle takes 36 hours, 4 turtles will take \(36 \text{ hours} \times 4 = 144 \text{ turtle-hours}\).

So, the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance is 36 hours.

The final numerical answer is:
36"
"First, let's find out how many dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

So, the final numerical answer is 140."
"First, let's calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount:

The original price of the laptop is $600.
The trade-in discount is $200.

So, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means that the total amount of money she has now is:
\[ 400 + 50 = 450 \]

Erika has:
- $150 from her part-time job.
- $80 from her mom.

Let's add these amounts together:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Now, we know that the total amount of money Erika has now is $450. So, the amount of money she has in her purse is:
\[ 450 - 230 = 220 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam slices 3 large apples, we can calculate the total slices from the large apples as follows:

3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, let's find out how many slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam slices 5 small apples, we can calculate the total slices from the small apples as follows:

5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples together:

15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract those from the total slices:

30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

So, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"First, let's find out how much milk 3 cows can produce a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows will give:

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters a day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we need to see how much more milk is needed:

25 liters (desired) - 15 liters (current) = 10 liters more needed

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk. Since each cow gives 5 liters a day, we divide the additional milk needed by the milk each cow can produce:

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is not used and then add those amounts together.

1. For the first glue stick, 1/6 is left, so 5/6 is used. The length used is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters. So, the length not used is 12 - 10 = 2 millimeters.
2. For the second glue stick, 2/3 is left, so 1/3 is used. The length used is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters. So, the length not used is 12 - 4 = 8 millimeters.
3. For the third glue stick, 1/2 is left, so 1/2 is used. The length used is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters. So, the length not used is 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths not used from each glue stick:
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"First, let's add up all the money Gabriel has:
- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$5000 + $200 = $5200

Next, we need to find out how much money Gabriel still needs for the car and the phone:
- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost of the car and the phone:
$10000 + $800 = $10800

Now, we subtract the total amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the car and the phone:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, so she gave a total of 4 * $20 = $80. The hat cost $70, so the change she got is $80 - $70 = $10.

"Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.
He buys six squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 * 2 = 12 dollars on squirt guns.
He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 * 3 = 9 dollars on water balloons.
In total, Craig spends 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.
So, Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left."
"First, let's find out how many socks Peter has. We know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can calculate the number of dishes Peter has:

\[ \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of dishes Jack has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \]

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, which is also the number of socks he has, we can calculate the number of socks Peter has:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Now we know the number of socks and dishes each person has:
- Jack has 60 dishes and 60 socks.
- Peter has 30 dishes and 120 socks.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add up all the socks and dishes:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 180 + 90 = 270 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 270."
"First, let's add the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only:

5 (good at math only) + 8 (perform well in English only) = 13

There are 20 students in total. So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:

20 (total students) - 13 (good at math only or English only) = 7

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"To solve this, let's break down the time each group takes and the total time available.

First, let's calculate the time each group takes:
- Getting on stage: 2 minutes
- Performing: 6 minutes
- Exiting the stage: 2 minutes

So, the total time for one group is:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, let's add the time for the intermission:
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Now, let's add the total time for the concert:
- Concert duration: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Intermission: 10 minutes

So, the total time available for groups to perform is:
120 + 10 = 130 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many groups can perform in 130 minutes. Since each group takes 10 minutes, we divide the total time by the time per group:
130 ÷ 10 = 13

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 13.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the original amount and the interest rate:**
   - Original amount (Principal, \( P \)) = $300
   - Interest rate per year = three-quarters of the original amount = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) percent per year

2. **Calculate the interest earned per year:**
   - Interest per year = \( 225\% \) of $300
   - To find 225% of $300, we can use the formula: \( \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \)
   - So, \( \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} = 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \)

3. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**
   - Interest per year = $675
   - Total interest over 3 years = \( 675 \times 3 = 2025 \)

4. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   - Total amount = Original amount + Total interest
   - Total amount = \( 300 + 2025 = 2325 \)

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars and how many don't.

There are 40 white shirts in total. Half of them have collars, so:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
So, 20 white shirts have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars. We already know that there are 20 white shirts without collars and 30 floral shirts without buttons. The difference is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all the eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. If he sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays."
"First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left.

So, the total number of goats left is \(45 + 25 = 70\).

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we multiply 2 by 12 (months in a year):
   2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

2. Now we know James buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year. He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount he spends by the number of pairs he buys:
   $2640 / 24 pairs = $110/pair

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- So, 3 baskets of green food will cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- So, 3 baskets of red food will cost \( 3 \times 18 = 54 \) dollars.

Now, we need to apply the $2 discount for each basket of red food:
- Since there are 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

Subtract the total discount from the cost of the red food:
- The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is \( 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food after the discount:
- Total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

"First, we need to find out how many rooms are half of 90 rooms. Half of 90 is 45 rooms.

Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

Now, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 minutes by 60 minutes/hour.

900 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, they build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). So, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, to find out how many homes they have built over the three years, we add the number of homes built each year:

- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

So, the total number of homes built over the three years is \(12 + 36 + 96\).

Let's add these numbers:

\(12 + 36 = 48\)

\(48 + 96 = 144\)

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

The final numerical answer is 144."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say you are X years old.
2. Your brother is three years older than you, so he is X + 3 years old.
3. Your sister is two years younger than you, so she is X - 2 years old.
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is 3(X + 3) - 1 years old.
5. The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: X + (X + 3) + (X - 2) + (3(X + 3) - 1) = 87.

Now, let's solve the equation:

X + X + 3 + X - 2 + 3X + 9 - 1 = 87
5X + 9 = 87
5X = 87 - 9
5X = 78
X = 78 / 5
X = 15.6

Since we are dealing with ages and 15.6 is not a whole number, it's likely that the problem is set up in a way that doesn't allow for fractional ages. However, if we assume the problem is correctly set up and we are to find the closest whole number, we would round 15.6 to 16.

So, you are 16 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

So, the final numerical answer is:

7 packs"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}

"Let's break this down step by step:

- On the first day, the plague infects 10 people.
- Each of these 10 people infects 6 others on the second day. So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected on the second day.
- Now, we have the 10 people from the first day plus the 60 new people from the second day, which totals \(10 + 60 = 70\) people infected after the second day.
- On the third day, each of these 70 people infects 6 others. So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected on the third day.
- Now, we have the 70 people from the second day plus the 420 new people from the third day, which totals \(70 + 420 = 490\) people infected after the third day.

So, the final number of people infected after three days is 490."
"First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times 20 \text{ dollars/customer} = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips to find out how much Julieta received:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received altogether, we add their tips together:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} + 720 \text{ dollars} = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which is a total of 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her only boy got 3 oranges. So, in total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the total she bought:

12 - 9 = 3

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"First, let's understand how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ badges/year} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/2 months} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 6 \text{ badges/year} \]

Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges/year} = 36 \text{ badges/year} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges/year} - 6 \text{ badges/year} = 30 \text{ badges/year} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige bakes banana bread. She starts at 1:00 PM and stops at 6:00 PM, so she bakes for 5 hours.

Next, we find out how many banana bread loaves she can bake in 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, we multiply the number of hours by the number of loaves per hour:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ loaves/hour} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so we calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so we calculate the total amount of money raised:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cents to dollars:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
2. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), then the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).
3. Since we know the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation: \( S + 30 = 70 \).
4. To find the number of silver coins, we solve the equation: \( S = 70 - 30 = 40 \).
5. So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.
6. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins: \( 70 + 40 = 110 \).

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110.

The final numerical answer is:
110"
"First, let's find out how many burritos were given to the students. There were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is:

50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos given out (to students and Mr. George) is:

500 burritos (to students) + 20 burritos (for Mr. George) = 520 burritos

George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos were leftover, we subtract the total number of burritos given out from the total number of burritos ordered:

600 burritos (ordered) - 520 burritos (given out) = 80 burritos

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we subtract 2 from the number of red cars:

12 red cars - 2 = 10 green cars

Next, we find out how many blue cars there are. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars:

10 green cars * 3 = 30 blue cars

Now we add up all the red, green, and blue cars:

12 red cars + 10 green cars + 30 blue cars = 52 cars

The rink has a total of 75 cars. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

75 total cars - 52 cars (red, green, blue) = 23 yellow cars

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know the total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, we solve for \( F \):

\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The final numerical answer is:
28"
"First, let's find out how much the sweet potatoes weigh. The sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes. Since the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, the carrots weigh:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:
\[ 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. There will be 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, we multiply 30 by 4:

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups one box makes:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Each box of jello costs $1.25. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello."
"First, let's find out how much the electronics seller spent on the phones. The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total monthly cost**: $400

2. **Madeline's share**: 60% of $400
   - To find 60% of $400, we can calculate it as follows:
     - 10% of $400 is $40 (because 10% is the same as dividing by 10).
     - So, 60% of $400 is 6 times $40, which is $240.

3. **Keenan's share**: The rest of the $400
   - Keenan's share is $400 - $240 = $160.

4. **Keenan's weekly cost**: We need to find out how much Keenan spends in one week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:
     - $160 ÷ 4 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

2/5 of 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first day.

60 pieces - 24 pieces = 36 pieces

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.

So, after the second day, the number of pieces left is:

36 pieces - 10 pieces = 26 pieces

On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.

7/13 of 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Tobias ate:

Pieces eaten on the first day: 24 pieces
Pieces eaten on the second day: 10 pieces
Pieces eaten on the third day: 14 pieces

Total pieces eaten = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, let's find out how much one bottle of water costs. If four bottles of water cost $8.00, then one bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.
- The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, let's find out how much 16 bolts cost. Each bolt costs $0.03, so we multiply 16 by $0.03:

16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12.

\[ \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 132."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gave him more marbles.

Paul originally has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles.

So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:
52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Next, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate 1/4 of 80:
1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him more marbles:
80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is 60."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Amy got right in each type.

For multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 questions.
- She got 80% right.
- So, she got \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \) questions right.

For true/false questions:
- There are 20 questions.
- She got 90% right.
- So, she got \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \) questions right.

For long-answer questions:
- There are 5 questions.
- She got 60% right.
- So, she got \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \) questions right.

Now, let's calculate the total points she got from each type of question.

For multiple-choice questions:
- Each question is worth 1 point.
- She got 8 questions right.
- So, she got \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points.

"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

To find 3/5 of 300, we do:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 3 \times \frac{300}{5} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we know that he wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling these 180 chickens at $50 each.

To find the total money he needs to make this profit, we add the profit to the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total selling price} = \text{Profit} + \text{Total selling price} \]
\[ \text{Total selling price} = 2000 + (\text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Price per chicken}) \]
\[ \text{Total selling price} = 2000 + (180 \times 50) \]
\[ \text{Total selling price} = 2000 + 9000 = 11000 \]

So, the total money Isaias needs to make from selling the chickens is $11000.

Now, to find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to know the total cost of the 180 chickens. Since he sold them for $50 each, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Price per chicken} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $9000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9000 \]"
"Micah sold the same number of glasses as Mitchell. First, we need to find out how many glasses Mitchell sold. Since Julie and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3.

Total glasses sold = 32
Julie's glasses = 14
So, the number of glasses sold by the boys (which is the same as Mitchell's) = 32 - 14 = 18

Now, we know Julie sold 14 glasses and Mitchell (and the boys) sold 18 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Mitchell, we subtract Mitchell's glasses from Julie's glasses.

More glasses Julie sold than Mitchell = 14 - 18 = -4

Since we are looking for how many more glasses Julie sold, and the result is negative, it means Julie sold 4 fewer glasses than Mitchell. So, the answer is:

-4"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Iris spent $400 on hair.
2. She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure. So, 1/4 of $400 is $400 / 4 = $100.
3. She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure. So, 3/4 of $100 is $100 * 3/4 = $75.

Now, to find out how much she spent in total, we add up the amounts:
- Hair: $400
- Manicure: $100
- Pedicure: $75

Total = $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

So, the final numerical answer is $575."
"First, let's find out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope.

Sarah's rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 a meter. So, the total money she will get is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope:
$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.666... meters

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters is:
26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Now, to find out how much money she will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling her rope:
$40 - $39 = $1

So, the final numerical answer is:
1"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out how old Melanie is now, we subtract 10 years from 18:
   18 - 10 = 8 years old.

2. Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8 years.

3. If we want her age to be three times her current age, we calculate:
   3 * 8 = 24 years.

4. To find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old, we subtract her current age from 24:
   24 - 8 = 16 years.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for the chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for the strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for the apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon = $10
- Total cost of chicken = $24
- Total cost of strawberries = $12
- Total cost of apples = $14

Total cost of all items = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say Elaina's usual concert runs for \( x \) minutes.
2. For the final concert, she makes it twice as long as her usual concerts. So, the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long.
3. At the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. So, the total time for the final concert is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.
4. We know that the total time for the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 = 65
   \]
5. Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 15 = 65
   \]
   Subtract 15 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 50
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:

"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit in pairs. We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit. So, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones won't be paired. So, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, so:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, we can find out how many plants are flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Now, let's add the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. So, the cost of the carrots she eats every day is:
\[ \text{Cost of carrots} = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Mark used to make in a day. He worked 8 hours a day and made $10 an hour, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times $10/\text{hour} = $80/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate how much he makes in a week before the raise:

\[ $80/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = $400/\text{week} \]

Now, Mark's pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ $10/\text{hour} + $2/\text{hour} = $12/\text{hour} \]

Then, we calculate how much he makes in a day with the new pay rate:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times $12/\text{hour} = $96/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate how much he makes in a week with the new pay rate:

\[ $96/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = $480/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is $480."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
3. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
4. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn.

First, we need to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. We know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, we can calculate the total mowing earnings as follows:

- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 * $6 = $30

Now, we add up the earnings from mowing lawns:
$6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54

Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the mowing earnings from the total earnings:
$80 (total) - $54 (mowing) = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

The final numerical answer is:
$26"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. Martin's weight is 55 kg.

So, Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, let's find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.

So, Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, let's find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.

So, Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John rents his car in a month. He rents it 10 times a month and each time for 3 hours. So, we multiply:

10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours/month

Next, we calculate how much money John makes in a month. He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, we multiply:

30 hours/month * $25/hour = $750/month

Now, we need to find out the profit. To do this, we subtract the car payment from the money he makes:

$750/month - $500/month = $250/month

So, John makes a profit of $250 a month from renting his car."
"First, let's figure out how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. So, we subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the 7 she has now:

7 - 5 = 2

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Since Martha originally had 2 notebooks, Joseph had:

3 * 2 = 6 notebooks

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has:

7 - 6 = 1

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

1"
"First, let's find out how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's distance and Anis's distance:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Susan would have if she didn't give any to her husband. She made 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so:

100 - 4 = 96 cookies

Now, Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read:

- Denise's total pages: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Daniel's total pages: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

- Difference: \(28\) (Denise's total) - \(13\) (Daniel's total) = \(15\) pages.

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's understand the pot's capacity. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl too. That's two bowls already used.

Calvin and his wife have two bowls, and there are two children. So, there are four bowls in total that need to be filled from the pot.

The pot can fill four adult's bowls, which means it can fill eight child's bowls. Since we have already used two adult's bowls, the pot can still fill 2 * 4 = 8 - 2 = 6 child's bowls.

So, the leftover soup can be divided into 6 child's bowls. Since there are two children, each child can have 6 / 2 = 3 bowls of soup.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To find out how much William spent in all, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought 5 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ballpen is \( 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together:
- Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen
- Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

So, William spent in all $8.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for one small mask and one large mask.

- For small masks: Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For large masks: Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.

Now, we need to calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

- For 20 small masks: \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks: \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

To find the total material needed, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks together:

- Total material needed: \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) yards of material.

So, the final numerical answer is 16 yards."
"First, we need to find out how many times Deepa has seen all the movies in total. She has seen each of the 9 movies 3 times, so:

9 movies * 3 times each = 27 times

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 times. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

$216 / 27 times = $8 per ticket

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day.

There are 24 hours in a day.

So, the free time Harold has is 24 - 10 (sleep) - 8 (work) - 1 (dog) = 5 hours.

"First, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim has left after using 3 of them:
- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- So, 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes are left.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes Tim has left after using 1/3 of them:
- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- 1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3 red shoe boxes.
- So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.
- Therefore, 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes are left.

Now, let's add the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 6
- Total shoe boxes left: 4 + 6 = 10

"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. He gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie. 

1/5 of 30 is calculated as:
30 * (1/5) = 6 marbles

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Now, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

So, the total number of marbles Dean gives away is:
6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16 marbles

Dean originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 16 marbles, the number of marbles left for Dean is:
30 - 16 = 14 marbles

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Duncan's current age is 60 years.

2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
   60 - 8 = 52 years.

3. According to the question, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's age four years ago be \( A \), then:
   52 = 2 * A
   So, \( A = 52 / 2 = 26 \) years.

4. Four years ago, Adam's age was 26 years. So, Adam's current age is:
   26 + 4 = 30 years.

5. In 8 years, Adam's age will be:
   30 + 8 = 38 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 38."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm is. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 200 * 2 = 400 acres. 

Then, 100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

Now, to find out how many acres the two farms have together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm: 

200 acres (Farmer Brown) + 500 acres (Farmer Smith) = 700 acres. 

So, the two farms together have 700 acres. 

The final numerical answer is 700."
"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So we calculate:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Now, we know he gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. So, for 40 packages in an hour, he earns:

40 packages * $0.20/package = $8.00 per hour

Since he works for an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by 8:

$8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00

So, the final numerical answer is $64.00."
"First, let's find out how long an extreme sudoku takes. A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme one takes 4 times that long. So:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour (60 minutes / 2), we divide 180 by 30:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in that time. The final numerical answer is:

6"
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny used for the red balloons. Since he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were twenty red balloons, we can calculate the total pieces of bologna for the red balloons as follows:

2 pieces/bologna * 20 red balloons = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. If we subtract the 40 pieces used for the red balloons, we can find out how many pieces were used for the yellow balloons:

58 total pieces - 40 pieces for red balloons = 18 pieces for yellow balloons

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find out how many yellow balloons there were by dividing the total pieces of bologna used for yellow balloons by the number of pieces used per yellow balloon:

18 pieces for yellow balloons / 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"First, let's find out how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we know that the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, he works \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours on Wednesday.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours on Thursday.

Now, to find out how many hours he works in all three days, we add the hours from each day:

- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

So, the total hours he works is \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons. A dozen is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 12 balloons, they need to pay:
   - First, find how many sets of 2 balloons are in 12 balloons: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) sets.
   - Then, calculate the total cost: \( 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \) dollars.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. So, the total cost for the ice cream is:
   - \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14

Total cost: \( 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items. Since they bought everything together, the total amount of money they had combined is $28. Because they split the money equally, we need to divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each one received.

So, each one received: \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate how many lollipops were sold in total by all the students.

There are 30 students, and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total money raised from selling these lollipops.

Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
So, the total money raised is:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.

Each lollypop cost $0.5 to buy.
So, the total cost for 300 lollipops is:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money raised.

Profit = Total money raised - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150 = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

"First, let's figure out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana has in total. She has 27 cups in total and she uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea. So, the remaining cups are:

27 - 15 = 12 cups

These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. So, we divide 12 by 2:

12 / 2 = 6 cups

So, there are 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Lana divides these 6 cups of chamomile and mint tea into 3 rows equally. So, we divide 6 by 3:

6 / 3 = 2 cups

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many berries the sloth can pick up in one trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, we know that the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries and climb back up. So, in 4 hours, he picks up some number of berries, let's call this number \( x \).

Next, we need to find out how many berries he can pick up in one hour. If he picks up \( x \) berries in 4 hours, then in one hour he picks up \( \frac{x}{4} \) berries.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick up in 8 hours. If he picks up \( \frac{x}{4} \) berries in one hour, then in 8 hours he picks up \( 8 \times \frac{x}{4} = 2x \) berries.

We know that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ x = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is \( 12 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's find out how much water is in the tank. The pool has 10000 gallons of water. Half of that amount is:

10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons

So, the tank has 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. After 6 days, the amount of water that will be emptied is:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, to find out how much water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount emptied from the initial amount in the tank:

5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

So, the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons."
"Let's break down the question step by step:

1. Colby has $150 to spend.
2. He already spent money on 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.
3. Each tub of popcorn costs $8, so 2 tubs cost $8 * 2 = $16.
4. Each box of candy costs $2, so 4 boxes cost $2 * 4 = $8.
5. So far, he has spent $16 + $8 = $24.
6. This means he has $150 - $24 = $126 left to spend.
7. He wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) first, so he spends $8 + $2 = $10 on these.
8. This leaves him with $126 - $10 = $116 to spend on tickets.
9. He can see a movie on Fridays and Saturdays for $10 each, and on other days for $7 each.
10. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he has $10 * 5 = $50 spent on these.
11. He has already seen 8 movies on other days, so he has $7 * 8 = $56 spent on these.
12. So far, he has spent $50 + $56 = $106.
13. This means he has $116 - $106 = $10 left to spend on tickets.
14. With $10 left, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday for $10.

So, the total number of movies he can see is 5 (already seen) + 1 (with the remaining money) = 6 movies.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so:
\[ \text{Total calories in mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so:
\[ \text{Total calories in mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs picked over the week.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (which is 5).

First, let's find out how many Junebugs Rita picked each day:

- On Monday, she picked 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, so she picked \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Wednesday, she also picked twice as many as Monday, so she picked \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs picked over the week:

\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 299 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs picked over the week is 299.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs picked per day. We do this by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):

\[ \frac{299}{5} = 59.8 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita picks per day is 59.8."
"First, let's calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:

Next, let's calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie has and then subtract that total from the number of toys she has now.

First, let's add up the toys Sophie already has:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Now, let's add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie now has 62 toys in total. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the total number of toys she already has from the total number of toys she has now:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Jean's age is \( J \).
2. Let's say Paul's age is \( P \).
3. Let's say Peter's age is \( T \).
4. Let's say John's age is \( Q \).

From the problem, we know:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. So, \( T + P + J = 100 \).
- Paul is 10 years older than John. So, \( P = Q + 10 \).
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. So, \( T = P + Q \).

We can substitute \( P \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ T = (Q + 10) + Q = 2Q + 10. \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( T + P + J = 100 \)
2. \( T = 2Q + 10 \)
3. \( P = Q + 10 \)

We can substitute \( T \) and \( P \) in the first equation:
\[ (2Q + 10) + (Q + 10) + J = 100. \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ 3Q + 20 + J = 100. \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 3Q + J = 80. \]
So, \( J = 80 - 3Q \).

Now we have \( J \) in terms of \( Q \). We need to find the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean. Since we don't have specific values for \( Q \), we can use the fact that \( J \) must be a positive integer and \( Q \) must be a positive integer. Let's try to find a suitable value for \( Q \).

If we assume \( Q = 20 \):
\[ J = 80 - 3 \times 20 = 80 - 60 = 20. \]
\[ P = Q + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. \]
\[ T = 2Q + 10 = 2 \times 20 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

Let's check if these values satisfy the original equation:
\[ T + P + J = 50 + 30 + 20 = 100. \]
It does satisfy the equation.

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \).

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. Maria also got 2 balloons. So, before her mom gave more, they had 8 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons.

Now, adding the balloons given by her mom to the balloons they already had, we get 10 + 15 = 25 balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.

10 people donate 5 boxes each:
10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

They also have 10 boxes already:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Now, we need to find out how many tables they can fit with 60 boxes if each table can hold 2 boxes.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need.

30 tables needed - 15 tables they already have = 15 new tables needed

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spit:

40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spit:

35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney to find the combined total distance:

400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of people (which is 2):

820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total money each machine can make in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's break down the costs for Cameron's stay.

Cameron wants to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.

1. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
2. For the remaining 5 hours, he adds 70 pesos for each hour after the 12-hour mark.

So, the cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we add the cost of the first 12 hours to the cost of the additional 5 hours:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay, but Cameron only stayed for 17 hours. So, the savings for Cameron is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 250 \]"
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Twice the amount each goat needs is:

5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this amount, so:

10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Now we know each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats:

15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep:

12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Finally, we add the amounts of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total:

75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas from his earnings. He spends 50 dollars on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

So, Craig has spelled out 300 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. We know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled out:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

So, Craig's brother has spelled out 350 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the number of letters Craig spelled out to the number of letters his brother spelled out:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows for each school, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

For each school:
- There are 8 children in a row.
- There are 7 rows for each school.

So, the number of children in one school is:
\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \]

Since there are 5 different schools:
\[ 56 \times 5 = 280 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]

The final numerical answer is 280."
"First, let's find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

900 bottles (from coupons) - 58 bottles (given to students) = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Visit Fee**: Patty's Plumbing charges a $40 fee for visiting the house.
2. **Labor Cost**: The labor cost is $35 per hour. The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is for part of an hour, we round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. So, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Cost**: The parts cost $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
- Visit Fee: $40
- Labor Cost: $105
- Parts Cost: $60

Total cost = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

So, Patty charged **$205**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs and each CD costs $15.

Total cost before discount = 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, James gets them for 40% off. To find out how much he actually pays, we need to calculate 40% of $150 and subtract it from $150.

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the amount he actually pays for the CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. So, we need to subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for the CDs.

Money he gets from selling 5 CDs = $40

Money he is out = Amount he paid for the CDs - Money he gets from selling the CDs

Money he is out = $90 - $40 = $50

So, the final numerical answer is $50."

- Yams: 6 yams * $1.5 each = $9
- Sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 each = $20
- Carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 each = $5

Now, let's add up all the earnings:

$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - He swims 60% of the distance.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   - He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Calculate the time he rests:**
   - He rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \).

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - He has already swum 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - He goes half the speed he swam at.
   - His swimming speed was 2 miles per hour.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \).

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim 12 miles: 6 hours
   - Rest time: 3 hours
   - Time to swim the remaining 8 miles: 8 hours
   - Total time is \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \text{ hours} \).

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"First, let's find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had by following the steps given in the question.

1. We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. So, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had, and then subtract 40 from that number.

Let's calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, we subtract 40 from 490 to find out how many loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. Each New York Times costs $5 and he gets a 10% commission on each one.

10% of $5 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \]

So, for each New York Times, he earns $0.50 in commission. Since he sells 6 copies, the total commission from New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets an 8% commission on each one.

8% of $15 is calculated as:
\[ 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \]

So, for each Wall Street Journal, he earns $1.20 in commission. Since he sells 10 copies, the total commission from Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Now, to find the total commission Cayley earns from both newspapers, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ 15.00 \]"

So, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Dinar scored \( D \) points.
2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Bahati scored \( D + 10 \) points.
3. Bahati also scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored \( (D + 10) - 20 \) points, which simplifies to \( D - 10 \) points.

Now, we know the total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 10) + (D - 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ D + D + 10 + D - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3D = 45 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ D = 15 \]

So, Dinar scored 15 points. Now we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

\[ \text{Azibo's points} = D - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book in inches by the number of pages that fit into one inch of paper.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, and we know that 1 inch of paper has 100 pages.

So, we multiply 1.5 inches by 100 pages per inch:

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages

The final numerical answer is 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 

Now, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling speed is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 60 reports

So, Vince stapled 60 reports in total. 

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"To solve this, let's break down the time Kim was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. But that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's a total of 23 minutes of sleepwalking.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep that day. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., so she sleeps for 8 hours. In minutes, that's 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Since she woke up at 5:55 a.m. and she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time.

So, 480 minutes (total sleep time) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking time) = 457 minutes.

The final answer is 457 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know he has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals 24. So, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

Now, we know that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate the number of measuring spoons he has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, we subtract these 6 spoons from the 16 spoons he originally had:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 \text{ (cups)} + 10 \text{ (spoons)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied and how many are unoccupied in the hospital.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. If 1/5 of the beds are occupied, then:
\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds is:
\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day. So, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:
\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Now, we add these 700 patients to the initially occupied 200 beds:
\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Finally, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (which is 9 emails) are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we subtract the number of emails to family from the total non-work emails to find out how many emails are left:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

2. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
3. Since Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason, Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they carried:
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

So, the total number of balls is \(2 + 4 + 1 = 7\).

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this, let's break down the digging process day by day and calculate the total number of holes dug.

First day: 10 holes
Second day: 13 holes
Third day: 8 holes, but they also filled in 2 holes, so net digging is 8 - 2 = 6 holes

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. So, four times 10 is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total by end of fourth day) - 29 (total by end of third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is 11."

1. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.
2. Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey.
3. We need to find out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.
4. Now, we add up all the corn chips:
   - Amora's chips: 70
   - Lainey's chips: 70
   - Collins's chips: 85
   - Total chips: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"First, let's find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( 4A - 13 + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Now, we know the total number of Pokemon they have caught together is 339. So we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Let's simplify the equation:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Now, add 21 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Now, divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. Now we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"
"First, let's find out how many episodes there are. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long. The question also tells us that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = Minutes per episode / 2
Number of episodes = 20 / 2
Number of episodes = 10

Now, we know there are 10 episodes, and each episode is 20 minutes long. To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the bird flies in each part of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First part of the journey:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second part of the journey:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third part of the journey:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we add the distances from each part of the journey to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles.

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's figure out how many brownies Greta had at the beginning. She made a batch for herself, which was 1 dozen brownies. A dozen is 12, so 1 dozen is 12 brownies.

At her office, she got 1/2 a dozen brownies. Half of 12 is 6, so she got 6 brownies from her office party.

When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 4 dozen brownies. Again, a dozen is 12, so 4 dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Half of 12 is 6, so 1 1/2 dozen is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had:
- From her own batch: 12 brownies
- From her office party: 6 brownies
- From her friends' surprise party: 48 brownies
- Brownies eaten during the party: 18 brownies

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"First, let's find out how old Nani's brother is. Since his brother is twice Nani's age, we multiply Nani's age by 2:

8 years * 2 = 16 years

Next, let's find out how old Nani's sister is. Since she is 25% younger than Nani, we need to find 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:

25% of 8 years = 0.25 * 8 = 2 years

So, Nani's sister is 2 years younger than Nani:

8 years - 2 years = 6 years

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:

Nani's age: 8 years
Brother's age: 16 years
Sister's age: 6 years

Total age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

The final numerical answer is 30."

- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes each = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes each = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time:

45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys 1 phone for himself.
2. He buys 2 phones for his kids.
3. The third phone (after the first 2) is half price.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first 2 phones:
- Each phone costs $600.
- So, 2 phones cost $600 * 2 = $1200.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the third phone:
- The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, let's add the cost of all the phones together:
- Cost of the first 2 phones: $1200
- Cost of the third phone: $300
- Total cost: $1200 + $300 = $1500

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Carlton's team has 13 players.
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team:
13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The final numerical answer is 33."
"First, we need to find out how many feet of fencing Robert needs to build. Since the fence is rectangular, we add the lengths of all four sides together. The length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. So, the total length of the fence is:

15 feet (length) + 10 feet (width) + 15 feet (length) + 10 feet (width) = 40 feet

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, for 40 feet of fencing, he will need:

40 feet * 2 wood slats/foot = 80 wood slats

So, the final numerical answer is 80."
"First, let's find out how many boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, let's find out how many boxes she has left. She originally had 12 boxes and gave away 4, so she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she didn't sell those. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate 1/4 of 12 boxes, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 boxes.

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. Since she had 8 boxes left, she sold 8 - 3 = 5 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is 5 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 100 oranges.

The final numerical answer is 100 oranges."
"First, let's find out how many states are in the USA. We know that the USA has 50 states.

Now, let's find out how many states India has. The question says India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we need to find half of the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to that number.

Half of the number of states in the USA is:
50 / 2 = 25

Now, add 4 to that number:
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, let's find the total number of states in both countries together:
USA states + India states = 50 + 29 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's add up the cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Now, let's see how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books:
- Money Tyler has saved: $14
- Total cost of the books: $39

$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25.

To find the number of hours, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
- Amount needed: $25
- Hourly wage: $5

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to earn the extra $25 he needs. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can subtract 10 from 30 to find out how many cherries Richard has.

30 cherries (Robert) - 10 cherries = 20 cherries (Richard)

Now we know Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries. We need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know the total number of cherries is 60.

So, the number of cherries Jerry has is:
60 cherries (total) - 20 cherries (Richard) - 30 cherries (Robert) = 10 cherries (Jerry)

Now we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
30 cherries (Robert) - 10 cherries (Jerry) = 20 cherries

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Saturday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
   - Apple pie: 4 fewer than gingerbread, so 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

2. **Sunday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 5 more than Saturday, so 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
   - Apple pie: 15 boxes

3. **Total Sales:**
   - Total gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
   - Total apple pie sold: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

4. **Price of Gingerbread and Apple Pie:**

"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use in one day.

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, in one day, she will use:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much sunscreen she will use in 8 days.

\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to cover 32 ounces of sunscreen.

To do this, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's find out how much the red car costs. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, it means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price (100% - 40% = 60%).

The blue car costs $100, so the red car costs 60% of $100.

To find 60% of $100, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the red car and the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

So, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 years old.
3. At that time, his dad will be twice Emil's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be half his dad's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old, which matches.
5. Emil will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older than his brother when he is 24.
6. So, his brother will be 24 - 5 = 19 years old when Emil is 24.

Now, to find out the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:

- Emil's dad is 48 years old now.
- Emil's brother is 19 years old now.

So, the sum of their ages now is 48 + 19 = 67.

The final numerical answer is 67."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which means her friend gave 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, to find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we add up all the beads she received:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

So, the total number of beads is 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

The final numerical answer is:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining students are:

30 - 6 = 24 students

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. This means the total number of students leaving early is:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students

\[ \text{Charlie's boots size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the two boots, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boots size} + \text{Sophie's boots size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert everything to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to feet.

12 inches = 1 foot

So, Pat's flowers grow 1 foot wide.

Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. This means that for every 1 plant, there will be 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.

Now, let's figure out how many plants Pat can fit in her 111 feet flower bed.

If we have 1 plant, we need 1.5 feet of space for the plant and 1.5 feet of space for the next plant, which makes 3 feet in total for 2 plants. 

So, for 17 plants Pat already has, we need to calculate the space they take up and the space needed for the additional plants.

17 plants * 1.5 feet = 25.5 feet

This means that 25.5 feet are already taken up by the 17 plants. So, the remaining space in the flower bed is:

111 feet - 25.5 feet = 85.5 feet

Now, we need to find out how many more plants Pat can fit in the remaining 85.5 feet. Since each plant needs 1.5 feet of space, we divide the remaining space by 1.5 feet:

85.5 feet / 1.5 feet = 57

So, Pat can fit 57 more plants in her flower bed.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of plants Pat will have:

17 plants (already owned) + 57 plants (newly needed) = 74 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be:

74 plants * $6/plant = $444

So, Pat will spend $444 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we divide Edgar's daily amount by 2:

18 pretzels / 2 = 9 pretzels per day for Edgar's brother.

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week.

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost for one basket:**
   - Katherine wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines to each basket.
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   
   So, the cost for petunias in one basket is:
   \[
   3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00
   \]
   
   The cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is:
   \[
   2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00
   \]
   
   Therefore, the total cost for one basket is:
   \[
   \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for all 5 baskets:**
   - Since one basket costs $14.00, for 5 baskets, the total cost is:
   \[
   5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
   \]

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = \frac{25}{100} \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for fancy shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings, we divide her monthly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

This means Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes each month. Since she can't buy half a pair, we consider she can buy 0 full pairs of shoes each month.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by 12 (months in a year):
\[ 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide 90 by 6 to find out how many minutes it takes:

90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to saute 30 shrimp. We know it takes 10 minutes to saute 30 shrimp.

Since we need to saute 30 shrimp and we already know it takes 10 minutes to saute 30 shrimp, we don't need to do any more calculations for the sauteing part.

So, the total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the time it takes to peel them, which is 15 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - So, it cooled the room by \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - So, it cooled the room by \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - So, the room warmed up by \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- Cooling on low: -6 degrees
- Cooling on high: -12 degrees
- Warming up: +4 degrees

Total change in temperature:
\(-6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \text{ degrees}\)

So, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Buford writes:
- 1 check for the electric bill per month
- 1 check for the gas bill per month
- 2 checks to the church per month
- 1 check to the pest and lawn service every 3 months (quarterly)

To find out how many checks he writes in a year, we need to add these up.

In a year, there are 12 months. So, we multiply the number of checks he writes each month by 12.

For the electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
For the gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
For the church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
For the pest and lawn service: 1 check/3 months * 12 months/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we add all these up:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips in one day, and these are all to Poland. So, the first plane must make twice as many trips as the second plane, which means the first plane makes 88 trips in one day.

2. The first plane's trips are split as follows:
   - Three-quarters of its flights are to Greece.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

3. Let's calculate the number of trips to Greece:
   - Three-quarters of 88 trips are to Greece.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips to Greece.

4. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany:
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Half of these 22 trips are to France, and the other half are to Germany.
   - So, \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips to France.

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
Chikote's howl = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

Now, let's find out how long Igneous howls. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined:
Igneous's howl = Tobias's howl + Chikote's howl = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time for all three wolves:
Total time = Tobias's howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous's howl
           = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds
           = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since 1 minute = 60 seconds):
Total time in minutes = 120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much money Adam's father gave him. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so:

Now, let's add the money Adam's mother and father gave him together:

$6 (mother) + $12 (father) = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30, and his mother and father gave him a total of $18. So, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (money from mother and father) = $12.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We can add up their ages and subtract from the total age to find Wilfred's age:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} \]

\[ 20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + \text{Wilfred's age} \]

\[ 20 = 17 + \text{Wilfred's age} \]

\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's add up all the money Walter has collected so far:
- From his neighbors: $500
- From his online fund: $1500

So, $500 + $1500 = $2000

Now, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. So, we add that to the total:
- Total so far: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. We need to find out how much everyone else has donated so far, which is $2200.

So, the lawyer's donation will be:
- Three times $2200 = 3 * $2200 = $6600

The final numerical answer is $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total People**: There are 6 people in total (2 adults and 4 kids).

2. **Slices**: We need to divide the watermelon into slices. Let's assume each person gets one slice. So, there are 6 slices in total.

3. **Size of Slices**: Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Then each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

4. **Total Size of Slices**: The total size of all slices combined is the sum of the sizes of the slices each person gets. So, the total size is:
   \[
   4x \text{ (for the kids)} + 2 \times 2x \text{ (for the adults)} = 4x + 4x = 8x
   \]
   This means the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

5. **Each Adult's Share**: Each adult gets \( 2x \) slices. Since the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \), each adult's share is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

6. **Percentage of the Watermelon**: To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we convert the fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \) to a percentage:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatients and appointments.

He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient. So, the total time for inpatients is:
9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time for appointments is:
10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, which is:
9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes

Now, let's find out how much time he has left to update his records:
540 minutes (total time at the clinic) - 480 minutes (time spent on inpatients and appointments) = 60 minutes

Finally, we need to convert the remaining time from minutes to hours:
60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To solve this, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake.

First, let's add the time to make the cake batter and bake it:
20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes

Next, we add the time to cool the cake:
2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
So, 120 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes

Then, we add the time to frost the cake:
10 minutes

Now, we add all the times together:
170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the total time needed to make the cake. We need to convert this into hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Jordan wants the cake to be ready at 5:00 pm. To find out the latest time she can start making the cake, we subtract the total time needed from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to add the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter, and then divide that number by the total number of chocolate bars they sold.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So together they sold:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. So to find out how many are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of days the studio is rented per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: We'll assume 4 weeks for simplicity.

First, calculate the cost per session for 10 students:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \text{ per session} \]

Now, add the rental cost to the cost for the students to get the total cost per session:
\[ \$25 \text{ (rental)} + \$15 \text{ (students)} = \$40 \text{ per session} \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 3 days a week:
\[ \$40 \text{ per session} \times 3 \text{ days} = \$120 \text{ per week} \]

Finally, calculate the total cost for 4 weeks in a month:
\[ \$120 \text{ per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$480 \text{ per month} \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$480 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars.
   - The total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 64.
   - To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
     \[
     \text{Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes} = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars.
   - The total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 56.
   - To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
     \[
     \text{Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes} = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]

3. **Find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:**
   - We know that Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.
   - Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.
   - To find the difference, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

8"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original number of porcupines plus the number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the measurements:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water are needed. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate the gallons needed:
\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the cost:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, let's calculate how far Matteo traveled. Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of these students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students
- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 1500 students
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students

Now, let's find out how many female students there are:

- Female students over 16 years old: 1500 (total over 16) - 375 (male over 16) = 1125 female students
- Female students under 16 years old: 1500 (total under 16) - 750 (male under 16) = 750 female students

Finally, let's add the female students from both groups:

- Total female students: 1125 (female over 16) + 750 (female under 16) = 1875 female students

So, the final numerical answer is 1875."
"First, let's find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda's contribution on the first day = 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the first day = 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Wanda's contribution on the second day = 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the second day = 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled in Two Days:**
   - Total water filled = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge would be:
   - After 1 hour: 100% - 9% = 91%
   - After 2 hours: 91% - 9% = 82%
   - After 3 hours: 82% - 9% = 73%
   - After 4 hours: 73% - 9% = 64%
   - After 5 hours: 64% - 9% = 55%
3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after 8 hours in total, the charge would be:
   - After 6 hours: 55% - 7% = 48%
   - After 7 hours: 48% - 7% = 41%
   - After 8 hours: 41% - 7% = 34%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

The final numerical answer is:
55"
"First, let's find out how much Janet earns in a week. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total weekly earnings are:

$10 + $15 = $25 per hour

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25/hour * 40 hours = $1000 per week

Now, Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment. So, the amount she needs to save is:

20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

$2000 / $1000 per week = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate how much Jamaar has spent on the fruits he already bought.

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\)
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add up the total amount spent on these fruits:

\(1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\)

Jamaar has $10 to spend. So, the amount left for plums is:

\(10 - 9.25 = 0.75\)

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:

\(0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\)

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. She originally had 15 packs and kept 2 packs, so:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

These 13 packs were given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we need to divide the total number of pieces in the 13 packs by 10.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs have:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide these 780 pieces among her 10 friends:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the price increase year by year. Let's start with the initial price of $120 and increase it by 5% each year.

First year increase:
5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
So, after the first year, the price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Second year increase:
5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
So, after the second year, the price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Third year increase:
5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
So, after the third year, the price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the final price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Olivia has 72 pictures and 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means there are 9 pictures in each album.

Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. So, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits:

- Number of selfies = 3 albums × 9 pictures/album = 27 selfies
- Number of portraits = 2 albums × 9 pictures/album = 18 portraits

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45

The final numerical answer is 45."
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion because the time to read is directly proportional to the number of pages.

First, we find out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages:
\[ 18 \div 3 = 6 \]

This means there are 6 sets of 3 pages in 18 pages. Since it takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages, it will take:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early. So, the number of guests left is:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests checked out late. So, the number of guests left is:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests.
   So, the number of guests now is:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in. So, the number of guests now is:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.

"First, let's find out how many easy questions there are in the quiz. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we calculate:

\( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \) easy questions.

Next, we find out how many questions are average and difficult. Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we subtract the easy questions from the total:

\( 60 - 24 = 36 \) questions left.

Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we divide the remaining questions by 2:

\( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, we calculate how many easy questions she gets right:

\( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \) easy questions correct.

Aries gets half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, we calculate how many of these she gets right:

\( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) average questions correct and \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) difficult questions correct.

Now, we add up all the questions Aries is sure to get right:

\( 18 \) easy questions + \( 9 \) average questions + \( 9 \) difficult questions = \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \) questions.

So, the final numerical answer is 36."
"First, let's find out how much Teresa sold each small stuffed animal for. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4.

Next, we need to find out how much Teresa sold each large stuffed animal for. Since large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]
So, each large stuffed animal costs $12.

Now, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so:
\[ S = 2L \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4S \) and the earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \). Therefore, we can write the equation for total earnings as:
\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

We already know that \( S = 2L \), so we can substitute \( 2L \) for \( S \) in the equation:
\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into the equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, in one day, the family eats:

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

In one week (7 days), they would eat:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the final numerical answer is 77."
"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne earned from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the money she earned from cookies and cupcakes:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Now, let's subtract the money she gave away from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. If there were 100 eggs hidden and 10 were not found, then 100 - 10 = 90 eggs were found. Since the Smith twins found 60 of those, the friends found 90 - 60 = 30 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- A dwarf with a bare hand can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
- A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine twice as much as a dwarf with a bare hand, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
- A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds of ore per day. So, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 pounds of ore per day.

To find out how much they can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

40 * 36 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.

So, the final numerical answer is 43200 pounds of ore."
"To solve this, let's first understand the prices of the packages with 2 and 4 sandwiches.

- For 2 sandwiches, the price is $3.
- For 4 sandwiches, the price is $6.

We can see that the price is doubling when the number of sandwiches is also doubling. So, if 4 sandwiches cost $6, then 8 sandwiches should cost twice as much as 4 sandwiches.

So, the cost for 8 sandwiches would be $6 * 2 = $12.

The final numerical answer is:
$12"
"First, let's calculate how much Tom has left to pay after selling his old bedroom and using the money to pay for part of the new bedroom set.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.
He sells his old bedroom for $1000.
So, he has $1000 left to pay towards the new bedroom set.

Now, he has to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000 to complete the new bedroom set.

Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 per month.

To find 10% of $2000, we calculate:
$2000 * 10% = $2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final numerical answer is:
$200"
"First, let's calculate how many red balloons burst. Sally had 25 red balloons and 40% of them burst. So, we calculate 40% of 25:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 0.4 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst. This means Sally was left with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons, so half of them are:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

This means she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. So, we calculate 75% of 8:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = \frac{75}{100} \times 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons. Now, let's add up all the balloons she carried into the school:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 15 + 6 + 8 + 6 = 35 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

\[ 35 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the chances step by step:

1. There's a 50% chance the normal teacher will come in.
2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

First, let's find the chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in:
- The chance the normal teacher gives an extension is 40%, so the chance she doesn't give an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%.
- If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. So, the chance he gets a personal extension is 20% of 60%, which is 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12 or 12%.

So, the chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is 60% + 12% = 72%.

Now, we add the chance that the substitute teacher will come in, which is 50%. If the substitute teacher comes in, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework 100% of the time.

So, the total chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework is:
- 50% (substitute teacher) + 72% (normal teacher) = 122%.

Since the total chance can't be more than 100%, we subtract 100% from 122% to find the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework:
- 122% - 100% = 22%.

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 22%."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for graduates and their friends and family. We start by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000 seats
Seats for graduates = 950 seats
Seats for faculty = 300 seats

So, the number of seats left for graduates and their friends and family is:
6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are 'G' graduates. Each graduate would get:
4750 / G seats

However, the question doesn't specify the exact number of graduates, so we can't calculate the exact number of seats each graduate gets without that information. But if we assume the question is asking for the formula or the number of seats each would get if we knew the number of graduates, the answer would be:

Each graduate would get 4750 / G seats

Since the question doesn't provide the number of graduates, we can't give a specific numerical answer."
"First, let's find out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, we calculate:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \]

Next, we need to find out how many small beans he can eat. We know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply:

\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

450"
"First, let's calculate the total time Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, let's calculate her total pay for the 3 days. She is paid $15 per day, so:

$15/day * 3 days = $45

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking. She pays $3 for parking each day, so:

$3/day * 3 days = $9

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total pay:

$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total pay after expenses by the total hours she spent on jury duty:

$36 / 18 hours = $2/hour

So, the final numerical answer is $2/hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at 16 dollars each:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at 6 dollars each:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ 66 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many soda bottles Richard will need to place along his driveway and then calculate the total time it will take him to place the candy in each bottle.

First, let's find out how many soda bottles Richard will need. The driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. So, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Richard will need to place a bottle at the start and then every 3 feet after that. So, he will place 8 bottles.

Now, we need to calculate the total time it will take Richard to go from one bottle to the next and place the candy. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next. Since he needs to do this 7 times (from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on until the seventh bottle to the eighth), we multiply the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next by the number of times he needs to do this:

5 seconds per trip * 7 trips = 35 seconds

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds."
"First, let's find out how many apples are in two boxes. Since one box has 40 apples, two boxes will have:

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, Uncle Franky plans to pack the apples with 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Moishe buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Moishe buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of Parmesan cheese + cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.

Moishe starts with $50. To find out how much money he has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from the amount he started with:
- Money left = starting amount - total cost
- Money left = 50 - 40 = 10 dollars.

So, Moishe will have 10 dollars left to buy meat."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
- He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
- Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job.
- His college degree triples his income, so after college, his income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed during college:
- He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- So, the total amount borrowed is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, he earned $25,000 a year.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim earned during college:
- He earned $75,000 a year for 4 years.
- So, the total income earned during college is $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the income he earned during college:
- The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000.
- The total income he earned during college is $300,000.
- So, the total income he lost is $100,000 - $300,000 = -$200,000.

Since the total income he lost is negative, it means he actually gained $200,000 by going to college. Now, we need to find out how long it would take him to earn back the $200,000 he borrowed.

- He has $200,000 to earn back.
- He earns $50,000 a year from his job.

So, the number of years it would take to earn back the $200,000 is $200,000 / $50,000 = 4 years.

The final numerical answer is 4 years."
"First, let's find out the size of the fabric Jim needs for one piece. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of the fabric will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs for one piece, we multiply the length by the width:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the square footage of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Letters**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Letters**: 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters is \( 85 + 17 = 102 \).

3. **Wednesday's Letters**: 
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's letters is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's letters is \( 204 + 5 = 209 \).

4. **Total Letters Delivered Monday - Wednesday**:
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters
   - Wednesday: 209 letters

   Adding these together: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \).

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."

"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won $1 + (2 * $5) = $1 + $10 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's add up all the money lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11 (he won, so it's not lost)
- Third race: $16.5

So, the total amount lost is $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find out how much he lost on average, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Total races: 3
- Total amount lost: $21.5

So, the average amount lost per race is $21.5 / 3 = $7.16666666667.

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

The final numerical answer is $7.17."
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

There are 26 countries.
Each country has 5 cities.
Each city has 1000 people.

So, we calculate:
26 countries * 5 cities/country * 1000 people/city

First, multiply 26 by 5:
26 * 5 = 130

Then, multiply 130 by 1000:
130 * 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit. Let's use inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch.

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's call the amount the first person took as x dollars.

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + $80.
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80).

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Let's simplify the equation:

x + x + $80 + 2x + 2*$80 = $1920
4x + $80 + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920

Now, let's subtract $240 from both sides:

4x = $1920 - $240
4x = $1680

Now, let's divide both sides by 4 to find x:

x = $1680 / 4
x = $420

So, the first person took $420.

The final numerical answer is:
420"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - So, the total number of days they worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

2. **Determine the number of days they worked each day:**
   - They worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - First, calculate \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \):
     \[
     21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875
     \]
   - Then, multiply by 24:
     \[
     7.875 \times 24 = 191.25
     \]
   - So, the team worked a total of 191.25 hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{191.25}{4} \) hours.
   - Calculate \( \frac{191.25}{4} \):
     \[
     \frac{191.25}{4} = 47.8125
     \]

So, each painter put in 47.8125 hours of work."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) tennis balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 4) + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we need a common denominator:

\[ 2x = \frac{4x}{2} \]
\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now we can find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008. The car depreciates by 21% each year, so it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The price in 2008 = $20000 * 0.79 = $15800

Next, we calculate the price in 2009. The car again depreciates by 21%, so it retains 79% of its value.

The price in 2009 = $15800 * 0.79 = $12522

Finally, we calculate the price in 2010. The car depreciates by 21% once more, so it retains 79% of its value.

The price in 2010 = $12522 * 0.79 = $9825.18

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9825.18."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the books are in English, we have:

50 books / 2 = 25 books in English

Next, we need to find out how many books are in German. 10% of the books are in German, so:

50 books * 10% = 50 books * 0.1 = 5 books in German

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

50 books (total) - 25 books (English) - 5 books (German) = 20 books in Spanish

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is about 1955 kilometers.

Bernice drove 325 kilometers in 4 days.

First, let's find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the costs of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: The original price was $8, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you need to divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. So, you need 200 tiles.

Now, to find the total cost, you multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile. Each tile costs $12.

So, the total cost = 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final numerical answer is $2400."
"First, let's find out how much more the insurance cost because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. To find 60% of $120, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } $120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = $72 \]

So, the increased cost is $72. Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the total cost per month:

\[ \text{Total cost per month} = $120 + $72 = $192 \]

To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Total cost per year} = $192 \times 12 = $2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is $2304."
"First, let's understand how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week:
- A twin bed has 2 sets of sheets.
- A king size bed has 2 sets of sheets.

Greg has:
- 4 twin beds, so 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets of sheets.
- 1 king size bed, so 1 * 2 = 2 king sets of sheets.

So, in total, he needs to wash:
- 8 twin sets + 2 king sets = 10 sets of sheets each week.

Now, Greg's laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time. Since he needs to wash 10 sets in total each week, we can calculate the number of loads he needs to do:
- For twin sets: 10 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 5 loads.
- For king sets: 2 king sets / 1 king set per load = 2 loads.

So, in total, he needs to do:
- 5 loads for twin sets + 2 loads for king sets = 7 loads of laundry each week.

Now, to find out how many loads he does in a year (52 weeks):
- 7 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 364 loads/year.

So, the final numerical answer is 364."
"First, let's find out how many movies Jill and her friends watch on Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, on Sunday they watch:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

Now, let's find out how many movies they watch in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday together):

\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies} \]

They watch movies every weekend, so in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:

\[ 6 \text{ (movies per weekend)} \times 4 \text{ (weekends)} = 24 \text{ movies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so before collecting those, he had 100 - 50 = 50 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he had 50 + 100 = 150 stickers.
In total, Leo has 150 stickers in his collection now.

The final numerical answer is 150."
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to first calculate how much cat food Imma's cats eat in total each day.

1. Imma has 3 cats.
2. Each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day.
3. So, each cat eats \(60 \times 2 = 120\) grams of food per day.
4. Therefore, 3 cats eat \(120 \times 3 = 360\) grams of food per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of food will last for 3 cats.

5. We divide the total amount of food by the amount of food the cats eat per day:
   \[
   \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}
   \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can calculate Jake's slices as follows:

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, we can calculate Silvia's slices as follows:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now we know the number of slices each person ate:
- Becky ate 10 slices
- Jake ate 7 slices
- Silvia ate 14 slices

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's call the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit is only 30 minutes, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to in a day. If 20% of the 80 emails don't require a response, then:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response each day. This means the rest of the emails do need a response:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:

First, add 32 and 64:
\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 to the result:
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 30:
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 25:
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- First 3 tests: 100 each
- 4th test: 80

First, let's add up all the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's find out how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas, so we calculate:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

This means the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final number of pizzas left is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants twice as many big coupons as small ones. So, if he wants 700 small coupons, he will want:

700 small coupons * 2 = 1400 big coupons

Now, let's calculate the cost for the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so:

700 small coupons * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Next, let's calculate the cost for the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so:

1400 big coupons * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost:

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):

24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage total."
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So we calculate:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, so we add those to the previous order:

7 + 3 = 10 meatball sub sandwiches

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so we subtract those from the total:

10 - 4 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Now, each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, to find out how many meatballs were in the remaining sub sandwiches, we multiply the number of remaining sub sandwiches by 4:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had problems. So we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons per truck} = 300 \text{ tons}

"First, let's figure out how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. He uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Now, let's look at the promotion. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter. If he buys 2 pounds at a time, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds to get 6 pounds of butter. Let's calculate the cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds.

1. For the first 2 pounds, he pays the full price: 2 pounds * $4.00/pound = $8.00
2. For the second 2 pounds, he gets the second pound at half price: 2 pounds * $4.00/pound / 2 = $4.00
3. For the third 2 pounds, he pays the full price again: 2 pounds * $4.00/pound = $8.00

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$8.00 + $4.00 + $8.00 = $20.00

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $20.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:
- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls in her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Now, let's find out how many people actually came to the party:
- Total invited = 45 people.
- 4 people could not come.
- So, 45 - 4 = 41 people came to the party.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 people, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 41 people came, we need to calculate the additional cost for the extra guests:
- Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Cost for each additional guest = $6.
- Total additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, let's add the base rental fee to the additional cost:
- Base rental fee = $125.
- Additional cost = $126.
- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the party will cost Kayla $251."
"Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it, so she spent $60 * 1/4 = $15. So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it, so she spent $60 * 1/3 = $20. So, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

The final numerical answer is 85."
"First, let's find out how many bananas all the monkeys eat together in a day. Since Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for 7 days, we can find out how many bananas they eat in one day by dividing 315 by 7.

\[ \text{Bananas eaten in one day} = \frac{315}{7} = 45 \]

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat in one day.

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total bananas eaten in one day.

\[ \text{Bananas eaten by the third monkey} = 45 - (10 + 14) = 45 - 24 = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.
Teddy also finished the second puzzle, which has 500 pieces.
So, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.
The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Jenny has left after buying the roses. The cost of the roses is $30, and she has $25, so:
\[ 25 - 30 = -5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the calculation shows she is $5 short, she needs to get $5 more to buy the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies she needs to get the change in quarters. Since she is $5 short, she needs 20 quarters (since each quarter is worth $0.25):
\[ 5 \div 0.25 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
- He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each.
- So, the total from milkshakes is \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total money from selling burger platters:
- He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.
- So, the total from burger platters is \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the total money from selling sodas:
- He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.
- So, the total from sodas is \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the totals to find the total money Terry makes:
- Total from milkshakes: $33
- Total from burger platters: $99
- Total from sodas: $30

So, the total money Terry makes is \( 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \) dollars.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given and calculate the waiting time for each train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, so it arrives in 10 + 30 = 40 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives in 40 + 60 = 100 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it doesn't stay in the station.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so it arrives in 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Paul needs to wait for the fourth train, which arrives at 120 minutes. Since he arrives at 10 minutes (first train), he needs to wait for 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:
110 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we know she needs 200 toothpicks in total and she has 120 toothpicks already.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Melanie needs 80 more toothpicks to reach 200. If she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was originally $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

To find 75% of $2000, we can do:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. To find 120% of $1500, we do:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend got from the original price. The original price was $2000, and he paid $1800.

To find the discount, we subtract the price he paid from the original price:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"First, let's understand the problem. We have 5 springs, and each spring creates a new jellyfish every second. We need to find out how many jellyfish are created in 4 hours.

1. Convert 4 hours into seconds:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400\) seconds.

2. Since each spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, each spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

3. Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created is \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\).

So, the final numerical answer is 72000 jellyfish."
"Binkie's score is 90.
Twice as high as Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.

The final numerical answer is 195."
"First, let's break down the journey James made:

1. James walks halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
2. He realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. So, he walks another 2 miles back to his home.
3. In total, he walks 2 miles to the store and 2 miles back, which is 4 miles in total.

Now, we know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:
40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Next, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be:
10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"First, let's understand the problem. Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. We need to find out how much fence Sam gets.

Let's say Sam gets \( x \) feet of fence. Then Harry gets \( x + 60 \) feet of fence. Together, they have 100 feet of fence, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2x + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Now, we need to find out how much is left over for Sam. Since the total fence is 100 feet and Sam gets 20 feet, the leftover fence is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

So, the leftover fence for Sam is 80 feet. Let's write the final answer:

80"
"To solve this, we need to find out how much the crocodile grows in one year first, and then use that to find out how much it grows in 13 years.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so in one year it grows:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how much it grows in 13 years, we multiply the growth per year by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold = 300
   - Half of them were Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
   - 15% were BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
   - The rest were MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB = $500
   - Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars
   - Earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the total earnings from all bikes:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
   - Total earnings = \( 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250 \) dollars

So, Marcel earned **131250 dollars** from selling bicycles during that month."
"First, let's calculate how many bales the farmer makes in a day. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, so:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

Next, let's calculate how many bales the truck picks up in a day. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, so:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, he has:

6 periods + 2 extra periods = 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so each day he spends:

8 periods * 40 minutes/period = 320 minutes each day.

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so in a week he spends:

320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes each week.

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. So, the extra learning time on weekends is:

1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes on weekends.

Now, let's add the extra learning time on weekends to the regular learning time in a week:

1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes = 1700 minutes/week.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1700 minutes ÷ 60 = 28.3333 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 28.3333 hours a week."
"First, let's find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce.

The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, the height of the third-floor balcony is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When the ball bounces, it reaches 2/3 of its starting height. So, after the first bounce, the ball will go up to:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce will be:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final height the ball goes on its second bounce is 32 feet."
"First, let's convert everything to inches because the differences are given in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is:
72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag.

Total apples sold = 2000
Apples per bag = 10

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
Number of bags sold = 2000 / 10
Number of bags sold = 200

Now that we know 200 bags were sold, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag.

Price per bag = $5

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
Total earnings = 200 * $5
Total earnings = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the triceratops had \( x \) kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

2. The T-Rex ate half of it, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

3. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

4. The lazy Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

6. Multiply both sides by 4 to get \( x = 270 \times 4 \).

7. Calculate \( 270 \times 4 = 1080 \).

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of each of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls (north and south), the total area for these walls is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of each of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls (east and west), the total area for these walls is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together to get the total area that needs to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 144 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 sodas, so there are 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
3. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
4. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.
5. Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 unshaken soda. This leaves 1 unshaken soda and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend has 1 unshaken soda and 2 shaken sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 = 66.\overline{6} \% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
66.67%"
"First, let's find out how fast each train is traveling. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so:

\[ \text{Speed of second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours. 

For the first train:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

For the second train:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."
"First, let's find out how many days Billy works. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so in total there are 31 + 19 = 50 days. If he takes 20% off, that means he takes 20/100 * 50 = 10 days off. So, he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

If he works for 40 days, then he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- There were 12 buses.
So, the total number of people in the buses is \( 12 \times 35 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- Each car carried 3 people.
- There were 20 cars.
So, the total number of people in the cars is \( 20 \times 3 \).

Finally, to find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars.

Let's do the calculations:
- Number of people in buses: \( 12 \times 35 = 420 \)
- Number of people in cars: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

Total number of people inside the church: \( 420 + 60 = 480 \)

So, the final numerical answer is 480."
"First, let's find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age:

\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long it takes to slide down each waterslide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest waterslide = Length of the slide / Speed
= 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
= 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest waterslide = Length of the slide / Speed
= 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
= 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
- Time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes
- Time for the second biggest slide: 3 minutes

Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
= 5 minutes - 3 minutes
= 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's find out how much time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

So, each day he spends:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (break) = 60 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days:
60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
300 minutes ÷ 60 = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate how many miles Micah ran by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Total miles run = 52 miles
Amber's miles = 8 miles
Micah's miles = 28 miles

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases.

1. Sheila originally charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance is:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00:
   - 20% of $20.00 is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
     \]
   - So, the sale price of the frying pan is:
     \[
     20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
     \]

4. Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels that was 10% off $30.00:
   - 10% of $30.00 is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
     \]
   - So, the sale price of the set of towels is:
     \[
     30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's call the total number of jellyfish in the tank \( x \). So, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

3. We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \). This means \( x = 6 \times 15 = 90 \).

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"Let's break down the question step by step:

1. Lauren saves 20% of her salary each paycheck.
2. She plans to save for 20 years.
3. She will live with 40% of her current annual salary.
4. Her current salary is $100,000.

First, we need to find out how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her salary, we calculate:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she will live on each year. Since she will live with 40% of her current annual salary, we calculate:

\[ \text{Annual living cost} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she needs to save each year to cover her living cost. Since she saves $20,000 each year, we need to find out how many years she needs to work to save enough for 20 years of living with $40,000 per year.

\[ \text{Total living cost for 20 years} = 20 \times \$40,000 = \$800,000 \]

Since she saves $20,000 each year, we need to find out how many years it will take to save $800,000:

\[ \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years} \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for 20 years of living with 40% of her current salary.

"First, we need to find out how long each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon will be. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he cuts it into 4 equal parts. So we divide 100 by 4:

100 ÷ 4 = 25

So each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. We do this by dividing 25 by 5:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

Let's call the total number of students in the school 'T'. So, 40% of 'T' is equal to 240 boys. We can write this as:

0.40 * T = 240

To find 'T', we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

T = 240 / 0.40
T = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Now, to find out how many girls are in the school, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. Since we know there are 240 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."

There are 6 heels in total (3 of each height).

To find the average, we divide the total height by the number of heels:

\( \frac{18}{6} = 3 \) inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"First, let's find out how many miles Soledad plans to hike in a day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Soledad walks twice a day, so:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike in total to cover 9,300 miles in June. Since June has 30 days, we divide the total miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to reach her goal of 310 miles per day from her current plan of 250 miles per day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles per day} - 250 \text{ miles per day} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how long each person took to do their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]
(Note: We assume ""over 4 hours longer"" means more than 4 hours, so we use 5 hours as the minimum extra time.)

Now, let's add up the total time they all took:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time for one way trip:**
   - John takes 2 hours to drive to his parents.
   - This is the time for one way trip.

2. **Calculate the distance for one way trip:**
   - We know the speed is 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance for one way = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Calculate the distance for a round trip:**
   - A round trip means going to his parents and coming back.
   - So, the distance for a round trip = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

4. **Calculate the total distance for a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance for a month = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

So, the total number of miles John drives a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles."
"Sofie walks 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

"First, let's calculate how many toys the first 4 workers can produce in 10 hours.

Two workers produce 6 toys an hour. So, together they produce:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 \text{ workers} = 12 \text{ toys/hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys an hour. So, together they produce:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 \text{ workers} = 8 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Now, let's add the production rates of all four workers:
\[ 12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

In 10 hours, the four workers can produce:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they had 200 toys. So, they still need:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker needs to produce these 200 toys in 10 hours. So, the fifth worker needs to produce:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

"First, let's find out the weight of Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, we calculate:

\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's dog that is one-fourth of Kory's dog} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let's find out the weight of Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, we calculate:

\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's dog that is half of Kory's dog} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:

\[
\text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of both dogs:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Seth originally had \( S \) stickers.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of his stickers, so he gave the other half to Kris. That means Luis gave \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
4. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. So, the remaining stickers Kris received and gave to Rob is \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 \).
5. We know Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, so \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \).

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[
\frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
S = 64
\]

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

900 M&M / 10 M&M/small bag = 90 small bags

So the final numerical answer is 90."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out what half of the way around the earth is. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be:
   \[
   \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

2. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. The problem states that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

So, the 2nd fastest car is:
5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour

Now, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

The faster car is:
1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour

So, the final numerical answer is 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

So, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say they each painted \(x\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's say Sarah painted \(y\) eggs, so Camden painted \(y + 12\) eggs.
3. We know that \(y + (y + 12) = 30\). This simplifies to \(2y + 12 = 30\). Solving for \(y\), we get \(2y = 18\), so \(y = 9\). This means Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted \(9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.
4. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs and together with Camden and Sarah they painted 56 eggs, we can write the equation \(2x + 30 = 56\). Solving for \(x\), we get \(2x = 26\), so \(x = 13\). This means Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.
5. Now we know:
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - Madeline painted 13 eggs.
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Sarah painted 9 eggs.
6. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted: \(21 - 13 = 8\).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

Each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we can calculate the total weight of the boxes:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we need to find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces make a pound:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

80% of 80 feet = 0.80 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we need to find out how many planks he can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, we calculate the total amount he makes:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, the final numerical answer is $96."
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000, we can find her brother's salary by solving:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

So,

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we find their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time spent on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

2. **Determine the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - The total walk is 3 miles.
   - 2 miles are on the beach and 1 mile is on the sidewalk.
   - Since 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is the same as the time spent on the beach because the problem states that the rate of speed on the sidewalk is twice that on the beach, but the time spent is the same.
   - Therefore, 40 minutes are also spent on the sidewalk.

3. **Calculate the total time spent walking:**
   - Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes
   - Total time: 40 minutes + 40 minutes = 80 minutes

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 80 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
80"
"First, let's find out how much money Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.

So, the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 every week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves each week:
\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees.

For the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

For the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

For the final tree with 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, let's add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. So, 2 dozen more marbles means 24 more marbles.

If Bob has 24 more marbles to reach 60 marbles, then he must have 60 - 24 = 36 marbles initially.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.

So, the final numerical answer is 26."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug is an unknown temperature, let's call it \( x \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the 33-degree mug now has \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees of water left.

Donny also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. This means the other mug now has \( x - 1 \) degrees of water left.

After pouring, Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. So, the temperature of the water in his water bottle after pouring must be at least 40 degrees.

The temperature in the water bottle after pouring is the sum of the temperatures from the two mugs:
\[ 29 + (x - 1) \]

We need this sum to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ 29 + (x - 1) \geq 40 \]

Now, let's solve this inequality:
\[ 29 + x - 1 \geq 40 \]
\[ 28 + x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 40 - 28 \]
\[ x \geq 12 \]

So, the second bottle must be at least 12 degrees to allow Donny to drink the water.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"First, let's calculate how many cows Melanie's father gets from Milkie Cows Limited in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 7 * 3 = 21 days. Since Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, in 21 days, they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Now, let's calculate how many chickens Melanie's father gets from Broilers Limited in three weeks. Since Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, in 21 days, they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens brought in over the three weeks.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.
After three weeks, there are 420 cows and 210 chickens.

So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.
The total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final numerical answer is 700."
"First, let's find out the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, Russell gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $40:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]

So, the discount is $4.00. We subtract this discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Russell gets 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels. So, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the final total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops. The question says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So we calculate:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops

Now we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. Since 2 scoops need 3 potatoes, we can find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops by setting up a proportion:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Solving for x, we get:

x = (3 potatoes * 18 scoops) / 2 scoops
x = 54 / 2
x = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 2 * 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know there are 17 green jelly beans and 34 red jelly beans. To find out how many blue jelly beans there are, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Total jelly beans = 60
Number of green jelly beans = 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Number of blue jelly beans = Total jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jelly beans = 9

So, there are 9 blue jelly beans."
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many lemons Tim gets from one tree in a year. According to the question, he gets 6 lemons from each tree each year.
2. Next, find out how many lemons he gets from all 5 trees in a year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree gives 6 lemons, we multiply 5 by 6.
3. Finally, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade (which is 10 years), we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Lemons from one tree in a year = 6
2. Lemons from all 5 trees in a year = 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons
3. Lemons in a decade = 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the ratio**: The ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

2. **Total parts in the ratio**: The total parts in the ratio 5:9 is 5 + 9 = 14.

3. **Total passengers**: The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

4. **Calculate the number of men and women**:
   - Since the total parts of the ratio represent 14 parts of the total passengers, each part represents \( \frac{84}{14} = 6 \) passengers.
   - Therefore, the number of men is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \).
   - The number of women is \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \).

5. **Women who alight**: 20 women alight from the bus.

6. **Calculate the remaining women**: Subtract the number of women who alighted from the total number of women.
   - Remaining women = 54 - 20 = 34.

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sunflower Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $2 from each sunflower.
   - He earned $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - To find out how many sunflowers he sold per day, we divide the total earnings by the price per sunflower:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]
   - Over 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ sunflowers}
     \]

2. **Bouquet Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $8 from each bouquet.
   - He earned $56 from bouquets per day.
   - To find out how many bouquets he sold per day, we divide the total earnings by the price per bouquet:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
     \]
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
     \]
   - Over 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is:
     \[
     84 \times 3 = 252 \text{ sunflowers}
     \]

3. **Total Sunflowers Sold:**
   - We have two methods to calculate the total number of sunflowers sold:
     - From sunflowers: 39 sunflowers
     - From bouquets: 252 sunflowers
   - Since these are different methods, we need to consider the context. The question asks for the total number of sunflowers sold, and both methods give us the total number of sunflowers sold over the 3 days.

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{291}
\]

(Note: The correct total should be the sum of the sunflowers sold from both methods, which is 39 + 252 = 291.)"
"First, let's figure out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, let's find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate how much money Adam makes from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Money from selling rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam initially had $100. After selling the rocks, he has $84.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the money he has left from the money he started with.

\[ \text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the picture scenes for the project.

First, let's calculate how many days it will take her to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- To find out how many days it will take, we divide the total number of large-sized picture scenes by the number of large-sized picture scenes she can draw per day:
  \[
  \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, let's calculate how many days it will take her to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- To find out how many days it will take, we divide the total number of medium-sized picture scenes by the number of medium-sized picture scenes she can draw per day:
  \[
  \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. We can write this as 0.20.

2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has 3 * 20% = 60% chance of winning. We can write this as 0.60.

3. To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket being a winner. So, 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply 0.12 by 100. So, 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final numerical answer is 12%."

Jim collected 27 seashells.

Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so:
Carlos = Jim - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so:
Carrey = Carlos / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
Total seashells = Jim + Carlos + Carrey = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 seashells.

They divided the seashells equally between themselves, so each person got:
Each person = Total seashells / 3 = 59 / 3 = 19 seashells with 2 seashells left over.

Since we are asked for the final numerical answer and we can't split seashells into fractions, each person got 19 seashells."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday.

7 feet (Isabel's height) - 2 feet = 5 feet (Ned's height)

Now, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height:

5 feet (Ned's height) + 1 foot = 6 feet (Carl's height)

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, to find the length of Carl's cane, we divide Carl's height by 2:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

Therefore, for 2300 people, we need:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we know that Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce from the number of bottles needed:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Carla has 8 babies in total.

1. **Dressing in Purple and Blue:**
   - 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple.
   - 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue.
   - So, the number of babies dressed in purple is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \).
   - The number of babies dressed in blue is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

2. **Wearing Bows:**
   - All the babies dressed in blue also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows.
   - So, the number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 \) (all in blue) + \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) (1/3 of the purple babies).
   - Therefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

3. **Calculating the Percentage:**
   - We want to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
   - Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple.
   - The percentage is calculated as \( \frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, the final numerical answer is:
50%"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
1907 reports

Next, let's add the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
2136 reports

Now, let's add these two numbers together:
1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports

The total number of reports received last week was 5168. So, to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in total. He owns 80 square meters of land.

1. He sold half of the land:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold this for $50.

2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold this for $30.

3. Now, let's find out how much land is left:
   \[
   80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter.

4. Now, let's calculate the total money he earned:
   - From the first sale: $50
   - From the second sale: $30
   - From the third sale: \(20 \times 3 = 60\)

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   50 + 30 + 60 = 140
   \]

So, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"First, we need to find half the age of Haley. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of that is:

26 / 2 = 13

Now, we need to find 10 less than this number. So we subtract 10 from 13:

13 - 10 = 3

So Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then in one day he uses:
2 times/mask * 3 times/day = 6 masks/day

To find out how many masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of masks he uses in one day by 2:
6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Cole hid. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs.

Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total found eggs from the total hidden eggs: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:
200 + 200 = 400 apartments

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments that is, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240
So, the third complex has:
400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Now, let's find out the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from 3 complexes, and each complex has 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so:
1040 apartments * 3 collections/week = 3120 collections/week

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, his weekly earnings are:
3120 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1248

The final numerical answer is $1248."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the 5-year-old amount, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the 5-year-old amount, so \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the 5-year-old amount, so \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the 5-year-old amount, so \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:

- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = \(50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350\)

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"Jack originally had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. So, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.

120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is \( Y \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the blue rope is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters long.
3. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters long.
4. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

We can write the equation for the total length as:
\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

Let's simplify the equation:
\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. We can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:
\[ 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially.

Ronnie was given $5.
Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

Next, let's assume that each of them gave the same amount of money to their little sister, say \(x\).

After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]

Let's solve for \(x\):
\[\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\]
So, we have:
\[15 - x = 12\]
\[x = 15 - 12 = 3\]

Now, we know that each of them gave $3 to their sister. So, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[5 - 3 = 2\]

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. The mural has four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
3. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
4. Half the mural is yellow.

First, let's find out how much yellow paint there is. Since half the mural is yellow, and the total is 12 pints, we can calculate the yellow paint as follows:
\[ \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as \( x \) pints each. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can write:
\[ \text{Red paint} = x \]
\[ \text{White paint} = x \]
\[ \text{Purple paint} = x \]

The total amount of paint used is the sum of all the colors:
\[ \text{Total paint} = \text{Red paint} + \text{White paint} + \text{Purple paint} + \text{Yellow paint} \]
\[ 12 = x + x + x + 6 \]
\[ 12 = 3x + 6 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 12 - 6 = 3x \]
\[ 6 = 3x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:
\[ \text{Red paint} = x = 2 \text{ pints} \]

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
- Tuesday: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 puffs.
- Wednesday: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 puffs.
- Thursday: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 puffs.
- Friday: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 puffs.

Now, to find out how many clouds she has counted in total across all five days, we add up the numbers:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, the total number of clouds Alice counts in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 

20% of 100 pods is:
\( 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \) pods.

So, the new box has:
\( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

The new box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We want to know how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

To find out how many cycles we can run with $1, we divide $1 by the cost of one pod. Since the cost of one pod is $12 for 100 pods, the cost of one pod is:
\( \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \) dollars per pod.

So, with $1, we can run:
\( \frac{1}{0.12} = 8.33 \) cycles.

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we can run 8 full cycles with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's find out how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially has. He withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ 1000 \div 20 = 50 \]

So, Thomas has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, we subtract 10 from 50:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, Thomas has 40 twenty-dollar bills left.

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 twenty-dollar bills, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, Thomas has 20 twenty-dollar bills left.

Next, he triples his money. Since each twenty-dollar bill is worth $20, tripling 20 twenty-dollar bills means:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

So, Thomas now has $1200.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[ 1200 \div 5 = 240 \]

So, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals.

3. Now, let's add up all the goals:
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)

4. The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of Team A's and Team B's goals:
   - Total goals = Team A's goals + Team B's goals = \(6 + 10 = 16\)

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. 
   - 45% of 5 inches is calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - So, by the end of Monday, the teacher has used 2.25 inches of chalk, leaving:
     \[
     5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Chalk Usage After Monday**: The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - 20% of 2.75 inches is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - So, each day after Monday, the teacher uses 0.55 inches of chalk.

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

5. **Daily Usage Calculation**:
   - Each day, the chalk decreases by 0.55 inches.
   - We need to find the number of days \( n \) such that the chalk length is less than 2 inches:
     \[
     2.75 - 0.55n < 2
     \]
   - Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     2.75 - 2 < 0.55n
     \]
     \[
     0.75 < 0.55n
     \]
     \[
     n > \frac{0.75}{0.55}
     \]
     \[
     n > 1.3636
     \]
   - Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 days before it is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:

\[
\text{Girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so:

\[
\text{Boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, let's find out how many girls are not on varsity. Since there are 12 girls in total and 4 are on varsity, the number of girls not on varsity is:

\[
\text{Girls not on varsity} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

Similarly, let's find out how many boys are not on varsity. Since there are 12 boys in total and 3 are on varsity, the number of boys not on varsity is:

\[
\text{Boys not on varsity} = 12 - 3 = 9
\]

Now, to find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls not on varsity and the number of boys not on varsity:

\[
\text{Total students not on varsity} = 8 + 9 = 17

So, the final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Now, let's calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike means we multiply the number of masks Mike bought by 3. So, 3 times 5 is 15.

Then, we add 2 more to that number. So, 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we add the number of teeth drilled and capped to find the total number of teeth fixed: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.5 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 50 \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, let's find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus originally bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000 \]

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk because it had passed the expiry date. So, we need to find out how much milk that is:

\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \]

Let's calculate the amount of milk returned:

\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the milk was returned and Mr. Marcellus got a refund for the returned milk, the refund amount is the cost of 1600 gallons at $3.5 per gallon:

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Wendy's age in seven years will be \( W + 7 \), where \( W \) is Wendy's current age.
3. According to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   W + 7 = 5(C + 7)
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   W + 7 = 5C + 35
   \]
   \[
   W = 5C + 28
   \]

5. In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
6. According to the problem, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]
7. Substitute \( W = 5C + 28 \) into the equation:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 28)
   \]
8. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   3(C + 25) = 5C + 28
   \]
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5C + 28
   \]
9. Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
   \[
   75 - 28 = 5C - 3C
   \]
   \[
   47 = 2C
   \]
   \[
   C = \frac{47}{2}
   \]
   \[
   C = 23.5
   \]

So, Colin is currently 23.5 years old. Let's check the answer to make sure it's correct.

If Colin is 23.5 years old:
- In seven years, Colin will be \( 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 \) years old.
- Wendy's age in seven years will be \( 5 \times 30.5 = 152.5 \) years.
- In 25 years, Colin will be \( 23.5 + 25 = 48.5 \) years old.
- Wendy's current age is \( 152.5 - 7 = 145.5 \) years.
- Check if 48.5 is a third of 145.5: \( \frac{145.5}{3} = 48.5 \).

The calculations are correct. So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{23.5}

"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. If he can buy 100 books for $500, then we can calculate how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

To do this, we divide $27000 by $500:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27000. That means he can buy:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, Bob wants to distribute these 5400 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. The final numerical answer is:
1800"

2. He picked up one apple and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
   - So, he now has 1 apple (the one he picked up) + 5 apples (the new ones that fell) = 6 apples.
3. He picked up these 6 apples, put 1 in his pocket and threw the other 5 into the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
   - So, he now has 5 apples (the 5 he picked up) + 6 apples (the new ones that fell) = 11 apples.
4. He picked up all 11 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 11 apples."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag is 50 kg and he ordered 850 kg, we divide 850 by 50:

850 ÷ 50 = 17

So, Ali ordered 17 bags of coal.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $18, and he ordered 17 bags, so we multiply 17 by 18:

17 × 18 = 306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's find out how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. So, we multiply 6 friends by 6 slices each:

6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Now, let's find out how many pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So, we multiply 6 friends by 4 slices each:

6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Now we know that Kate needs 36 slices of cheese pizza and 24 slices of pepperoni pizza. 

The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so to get 36 slices, we divide 36 by 12:

36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so to get 24 slices, we divide 24 by 8:

24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

The final numerical answer is 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up all the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran:
3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran:
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles from Tuesday and Thursday:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. But every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
3. So, in 15 minutes, 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs are made.
4. This means in 1 hour (which is 4 times 15 minutes), 18 * 4 = 72 snowballs would be made if no snowballs melted.
5. But since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to subtract the melted snowballs.
6. In 1 hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt.
7. So, in 1 hour, 72 - 8 = 64 snowballs are actually made.
8. We need 60 snowballs, and in 1 hour, 64 snowballs are made.
9. Since 64 is more than 60, we don't need to wait for a full hour.
10. We can calculate how many snowballs are made in 45 minutes (3 sets of 15 minutes).
11. In 3 sets of 15 minutes, 18 * 3 = 54 snowballs are made.
12. In 3 sets of 15 minutes, 2 * 3 = 6 snowballs melt.
13. So, in 45 minutes, 54 - 6 = 48 snowballs are actually made.
14. We need 60 - 48 = 12 more snowballs.
15. Since 18 snowballs are made in 15 minutes, we need 12 / 18 * 15 = 10 minutes to make the remaining 12 snowballs.

So, it will take 45 minutes to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now, and when Digimon came out John was twice as old as Jim, we can figure out Jim's age by dividing John's age by 2.

So, Jim's age is 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   38 (used) + 50 (ordered) = 88 bandages.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   At the end of the second day, they had:
   88 (from the first day) - 28 (used) = 60 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered:
   2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   They used half a pack, which is:
   50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   At the end of the third day, they had:
   60 (from the end of the second day) + 100 (ordered) - 25 (used) = 135 bandages.

4. We are told that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means they must have started with:
   135 (total at the end of the third day) - 78 (left at the end) = 57 bandages.

So, they started with 57 bandages on the first day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the haircut cost is for 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
100"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.

So, the total hours she works in a week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Next, let's calculate how many hours she works in a month:
- There are 4 weeks in April.
- So, the total hours she works in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 180 hours/month

Now, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly rate:
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.
- So, her earnings from working 180 hours is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not have any absences, she also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.

So, her total earnings for April will be:
$270 + $10 = $280

The final numerical answer is:
280"
"First, let's calculate how much Jason earned for each task he did:

- For doing laundry: $3.00
- For cleaning his room: $1.50
- For taking the trash out: $0.75 each time, and he did it twice, so 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
- For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 each time, and he did it 6 times, so 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in a two week period."
"First, let's find out how much blood one shark has. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood of one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood of one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. We can do this by multiplying the blood of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Blood of ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood of one shark} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ 1200 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1200 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Morning People**: 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. **People at 10:00**: 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
3. **People after 10:00**: Twice the number of people who came at 10:00 came in after that. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came in after 10:00.
4. **People by evening**: An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came in by evening.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

- Morning people: 50
- People at 10:00: 40
- People after 10:00: 80
- People by evening: 150

Total number of people = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.
She bought twice the amount of black pens, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.
Each pack has 5 pens, so for the black pens, that's 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.
Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens in total.
The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so each bottle of scotch costs:
\[ \text{Cost per scotch bottle} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per cognac bottle} = \$60 + 0.5 \times \$60 = \$60 + \$30 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. So, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day.

1. Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
2. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the first day, he planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

Next, we need to find out how many trees he planted on the second day.

1. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. So, he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
2. On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. So, he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the second day, he planted:
- 30 White Oak trees
- 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, we can calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days.

- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"First, let's calculate how much root beer Fred had left after each event.

1. Fred started with 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so:
   24 - 4 = 20 gallons left.
3. Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, so:
   20 - 7 = 13 gallons left.
4. Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, so:
   13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party and shared the remaining root beer equally. So, we need to divide the 8 gallons by 3.

8 gallons ÷ 3 people = 2 gallons per person with a remainder of 2 gallons.

So, each person could drink 2 gallons of root beer during the party."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that ""four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4 * x, where x is the number of coffee mugs.

2. ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4 * x + 8.

3. We are told that this equals 40, so we have:
   4 * x + 8 = 40

4. To find x, we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 8 from both sides:
   4 * x = 40 - 8
   4 * x = 32

5. Now, we divide both sides by 4:
   x = 32 / 4
   x = 8

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the fish have red stripes, so:

\( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after the red-striped fish are taken out. That would be:

\( 66 - 22 = 44 \) fish are left.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so:

\( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \) fish have blue stripes.

Now, to find out how many fish have both red and blue stripes, we need to know if any fish can have both colors. However, the question does not specify that fish can have both red and blue stripes, so we assume no fish can have both. Therefore, the number of fish with both red and blue stripes is 0.

So, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is:

\( 22 + 20 = 42 \)

The final numerical answer is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.

Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is:
\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set originally had 6 colors, half of that is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from the makeup set, which means she loses 3 colors:
\[ 22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[ 19 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's two-story house is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor is. Since the first floor is three times as high as Mattison is, we can calculate the height of the first floor as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find out how high the second floor is, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

40% of 700 = 0.40 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas from the total to find out how many shells are left.

700 - 280 = 420 shells

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

60% of 420 = 0.60 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

420 - 252 = 168 shells

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

The final numerical answer is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to add up the miles the other dogs need to walk and then subtract that from the total average miles per day.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The average miles per day for all four dogs is 3 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, the total miles all dogs need to walk in a day is:
4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles all dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"First, let's find out how much loan John got. His house is worth $250,000 and he got a loan worth 40% of that.

40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000

So, John got a loan of $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much of that loan he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount.

$100,000 (loan amount) - $60,000 (amount used to pay off debts) = $40,000

So, the final numerical answer is $40,000."
"First, let's find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. We add the weights of the three tunas:

56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, we know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much Deandre will earn, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final numerical answer is:
$64"
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we need to calculate 11/8 of $72.

To do this, we can divide $72 by 8 and then multiply the result by 11.

$72 ÷ 8 = $9

Now, we multiply $9 by 11 to find out how much she sold each magazine for.

$9 × 11 = $99

So, she sold each magazine for $99.

To find out her profit, we subtract the price she bought the magazines for from the price she sold them for.

$99 - $72 = $27

Therefore, her profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed each day for each setting and then sum them up.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - So, it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - So, it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add up the total water removed from all settings:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters.

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, let's find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons each. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they actually threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, the final numerical answer is 288."
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose.

For one dose:
- The first medicine is 14 mL.
- The second medicine is 3 times the first medicine, so it's 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, there are 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Now, to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses:
- 8 doses * 56 mL per dose = 448 mL.

So, the final numerical answer is 448 mL."
"First, let's find out how many students are in Ali's class. We know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Now, let's find out how many students are in John's classes. We know that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of students in each of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \]

Since John has two classes, the total number of students in John's classes is:

\[ \text{Total number of students in John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the number of students in Ali's class to the number of students in John's classes:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

To find the interest, we calculate 2% of $300:
\[ 2\% \text{ of } \$300 = \frac{2}{100} \times 300 = 0.02 \times 300 = \$6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ \$300 + \$6 = \$306 \]

Next, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. Let's calculate the total amount he will pay in 11 months:
\[ 11 \times \$25 = \$275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount Stephen will pay in 11 months from the total amount he needs to return to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month:
\[ \$306 - \$275 = \$31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \$31 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$31 \]"
"Each child needs 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, it's 5 * 2 = 10 diaper changes per day. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers. So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"First, let's find the volume of the jar. The jar is a square prism with a base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} \]

The base area is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square inches. So the volume of the jar is:

\[ V = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar. Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by the volume of one jelly bean and then multiply by 0.80. The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So the number of jelly beans that fit into the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{540}{0.15} \times 0.80 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{540}{0.15} \times 0.80 = 3600 \times 0.80 = 2880 \]

Now, Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. So the difference between the true number and the estimated number is:

\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off in his guess."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:** 20 people.
2. **Number of people who entered the bus at the first stop:** 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: 20 + 40 = 60 people.
3. **Number of people who entered the bus at the second stop:** 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people who entered at the second stop: 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: 60 + 30 = 90 people.
4. **Number of people on the bus at the third stop:** The number of passengers doubled.
   - Number of people on the bus at the third stop: 90 * 2 = 180 people.
5. **Bus capacity:** 200 people.
6. **Remaining spaces on the bus:** 200 - 180 = 20 people.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

"First, let's find out how much Pauline spent in the first 5 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in one year she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

For 5 years, she spends:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

Next, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of the original cost and add it to the original cost:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$2 = 1.5 \times \$2 = \$3 \]
\[ \text{New cost} = \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

Now, for the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year at the new cost of $5 per visit. So, in one year she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5/\text{visit} = \$15/\text{year} \]

For 3 years, she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ years} \times \$15/\text{year} = \$45 \]

Finally, to find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum over the 8 years, we add the amounts spent in the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \$75 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many students are in each grade. There are 10 students in each grade, and there are 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 6th). So, we calculate the total number of students:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students

Now, we know that only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups of 8 students we need to have all 30 students try the escape room, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try at once:

30 students ÷ 8 students/group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number because even if there are some students left over, they still need to try the escape room. So, we need 4 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find out how long it will take for all 4 groups, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:

4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes

So, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John made 4 wooden tables and each table costs $20. So, the cost for the tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames and each frame costs $10. So, the cost for the frames is:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the frames to find out the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 (tables) + $20 (frames) = $100

So, the final amount Ali has to pay John is $100."
"Let's call the length of the shorter piece x feet. Then the longer piece is 4 times longer, so it is 4x feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. So we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

This simplifies to:

5x = 40

To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 40 / 5

x = 8

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so:

4 * 8 = 32

The longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of meat

Now, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of meat, he will need:

5 pounds × 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

So, the final numerical answer is 10 tablespoons."
"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. There are five windows, each 35 inches wide. So we multiply 35 inches by 5:

35 inches * 5 = 175 inches

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So we multiply the total width by 2:

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

The final numerical answer is 350."
"To solve this, let's break the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute. So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts to get the total cost:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. It rained 2 inches on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount that fell on Monday.

First, we calculate twice the amount that fell on Monday:
- Twice of Monday's total = 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

Then, we add 1 inch to this amount to find out how much it will rain on Tuesday:
- 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

So, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's figure out how many treats in total Carly needs to make. Since there are 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats, we multiply 5 by 2:

5 * 2 = 10 treats

Now, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is C. Then the number of brownies she makes is 3C - 2.

The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is 10, so we can write the equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms: C + 3C - 2 = 10
2. Simplify: 4C - 2 = 10
3. Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12
4. Divide both sides by 4: C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out the cost of a basic manicure and a pedicure together without any discount. 

A basic manicure costs $35 and a pedicure costs $40. So, the total cost for both is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands with 5 fingers each). Each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay in all:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has, we get the number of paintings Shelley has. 
   - 27 (Samantha's paintings) + 12 = 39 (Shelley's paintings)
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we get the number of paintings Kim has.
   - 39 (Shelley's paintings) - 8 = 31 (Kim's paintings)

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final numerical answer is:
31"
"First, let's find out how much the price increased in December. If the price increased by 80%, we calculate 80% of $40:

\( 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \)

So, the price in December became:

\( 40 + 32 = 72 \)

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. To find out how much the price decreased, we calculate 50% of $72:

\( 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \)

So, the price in January became:

\( 72 - 36 = 36 \)

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
- Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour.

Next, let's calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran:
- The reduced fee is 25% less than the standard fee.
- 25% of $80 is calculated as follows:
  - 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
- So, the reduced fee is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total money made from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour.
- Total for standard lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

Next, let's calculate the total money made from the veteran lessons:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.
- Total for veteran lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

Finally, let's add the totals from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money made for the day:
- Total amount = $320 (standard lessons) + $120 (veteran lessons) = $440

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

Let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 650

Now, we count the number of quizzes, which is 9.

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:
650 ÷ 9 = 72.22222222222222

Rounded to two decimal places, the mean score is 72.22.

The final numerical answer is 72.22."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of 20 pomelos.

"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, so:

\( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) apples

So, the number of apples left after eating is:

\( 60 - 24 = 36 \) apples

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. So, we calculate 25% of 36:

\( 25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \) apples

The number of apples left after giving his sister 9 apples is:

\( 36 - 9 = 27 \) apples

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total money he received is:

\( 27 \times 3 = 81 \) dollars

So, the final numerical answer is 81 dollars."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to figure out what the whole is when 9 novels is 3 quarters of it.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters, then 1 quarter would be 9 divided by 3, which is 3 novels.

Since 1 quarter is 3 novels, the whole (which is this year's total) would be 3 times 4 (because 4 quarters make a whole).

So, this year's total novels would be 3 * 4 = 12 novels.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Michael travels at 50 km/hr.
2. He travels for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.
3. In 72 hours, he travels 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.
4. The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
5. To find out what percentage of the total distance he has covered, we use the formula: (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100.

So, the calculation is:
(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The final numerical answer is 60%."
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. He used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:

5 times 6 grapes = 30 grapes

Now, let's add the grapes Madeline ate to the grapes her brother used:

6 grapes (Madeline) + 30 grapes (brother) = 36 grapes

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

4 pies * 12 grapes per pie = 48 grapes

Now, we need to find out how many grapes there were at the beginning. We know that the mother used 48 grapes for the pies, but we also know that Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes. So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies:

36 grapes (Madeline and brother) + 48 grapes (for pies) = 84 grapes

So, the final numerical answer is 84 grapes."
"First, let's find out how many teachers were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total and 13 were sick, so:

82 - 13 = 69 teachers were not sick.

69 + 9 = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's find out how much Bud spends on cheese each time he makes macaroni and cheese.

He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
He spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese, so:
$3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta and the cheese together:
$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00

This is the total cost for one batch of macaroni and cheese.

Since Bud makes it once a week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
52 weeks in a year

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one year:
$10.00 (cost for one batch) * 52 (weeks in a year) = $520.00

So, the final numerical answer is $520.00."
"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all the classrooms.

There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom.
So, the total time needed is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours.

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, the total number of books all the shelves can hold together is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens would be:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much Rose spent on the eggs. Since the eggs cost $2.40 per dozen and she bought five dozens:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, we need to find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. So, to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Now, we can calculate the total selling price:

20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find out Rose's profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:

$20.00 (selling price) - $12.00 (cost) = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many hats are white:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs normally.

There are 30 sticks in a bag that costs $18.00.

So, the cost per stick is:
\[ \frac{18.00}{30} = 0.60 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Now, if the store is $3.00 off a bag, the cost of the bag will be:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost per stick with the discount is:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

To convert this to cents, we know that 1 dollar is 100 cents, so:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

So, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"First, let's find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct. So we calculate:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test.

Now, to pass to 7th grade, she needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
This means she needs to get 77 questions right in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
So Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Mary makes \( S \) strawberry cubes.
2. The number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).
3. The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is \( S + (5S - 4) \).
4. We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.

So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now let's solve this equation:

1. Combine like terms:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

2. Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

3. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

So Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

   - For every 2 cars sold, Jason needs 2 customers.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, he needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (because even if he doesn't get a customer, he still needs to make the calls).

2. **Determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - To get 8 customers, he needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) calls.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"First, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
- The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up all the times:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30\) minutes.

"First, let's find out how many robots there are. The problem states that there are half as many robots as helmets. Since there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

\[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of helmets} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many footballs there are. The problem states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. Since there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times \text{Number of helmets} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:

\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is:

"First, we need to find out how much longer it takes for one painting with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish. The old varnish takes 7 minutes and the new varnish takes 12 minutes. So, the difference is:

12 minutes - 7 minutes = 5 minutes

This means it takes 5 minutes longer for one painting with the new varnish to dry.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it will take for 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry. Since it takes 5 minutes longer for one painting, for 6 paintings it will take:

5 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 30 minutes

So, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Crista has 20 plants in total.
- 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
- The rest need a quarter of a cup of water each.

To find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we subtract the number of plants that need half a cup and 1 cup of water from the total number of plants:

20 (total plants) - 4 (half a cup plants) - 8 (1 cup plants) = 8 (quarter cup plants)

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for each group:

- For the 4 plants that need half a cup each: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups
- For the 8 plants that need 1 cup each: 8 * 1 = 8 cups
- For the 8 plants that need a quarter cup each: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups

Now, we add up all the cups of water needed:

2 (from half a cup plants) + 8 (from 1 cup plants) + 2 (from quarter cup plants) = 12 cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the time for each part of the journey.

1. **Total Distance**: Phineas needs to travel 200 yards to get home.

2. **Distance on Land and in Water**: Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate each part:
   - Distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
   - Distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

3. **Speeds**:
   - Hopping on land: 20 yards per minute
   - Swimming in water: 10 yards per minute

4. **Time to Hop on Land**:
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time on land = \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

5. **Time to Swim in Water**:
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time in water = \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \)

6. **Total Time**:
   - Total time = Time on land + Time in water
   - Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box has 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Next, we need to calculate the cost. Each box costs $2.00, and he needs 7 boxes, so we multiply 7 by $2.00:

7 × $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone costs $20.
Each additional phone costs half of the main phone, so each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

There are five phones in total, so if one is the main phone costing $20, the remaining four are additional phones each costing $10.

The cost of the four additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

So, the total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

The final numerical answer is:
$60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of doughnuts made each day:**
   - Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
   - 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts.
   - So, 10 dozen doughnuts = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling one doughnut:**
   - Each doughnut is sold for $2.

3. **Calculate the daily revenue:**
   - Daily revenue = Number of doughnuts * Price per doughnut
   - Daily revenue = 120 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $240.

4. **Determine the number of days in June:**
   - June has 30 days.

5. **Calculate the total revenue for June:**
   - Total revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days in June
   - Total revenue = $240/day * 30 days = $7200.

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload in one day. She uploads 7 photos in one batch and does 6 batches each day. So, we multiply 7 by 6:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

Now, we know she has 210 photos in total. To find out how many days she needs to upload all the photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost for one week:

"First, let's find out John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

\[ 10 \text{ pages} \times 450 \text{ words/page} = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time in minutes can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by the speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it would take him 12 minutes to speak 10 pages. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day. So, he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The number of people was twice the number from the second day. So, he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.
4. **Fourth Day to Sunday**: We need to find out how many people Conor saw on these days to calculate the total for the week. We know the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week is 60. Since there are 4 days left (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), the total number of people seen on these days is \(4 \times 60 = 240\).

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw over the week:
- First day: 50 people
- Second day: 70 people
- Third day: 140 people
- Fourth day to Sunday: 240 people

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[500\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of kernels that popped:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"First, let's figure out how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs for 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 4 gallons will require 4 cups of lemon juice.

Now, since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 4 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons for each cup of juice and then multiply by 4.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 4 \text{ cups} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Tim's best friend Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart. This means Tim needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade, which requires 1 cup of lemon juice. So, he will need 6 lemons for this extra gallon.

Adding the lemons needed for the extra gallon to the lemons needed for the 4 gallons, we get:
\[ 24 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final number of lemons Tim will need is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the German Shepherds need in a week.

There are 3 German Shepherds and each consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the German Shepherds per day is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/German Shepherd = 15 kg

To find out how much they need in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week):
15 kg/day * 7 days/week = 105 kg/week

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the Bulldogs need in a week.

There are 2 Bulldogs and each consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the Bulldogs per day is:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/Bulldog = 6 kg

To find out how much they need in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week):
6 kg/day * 7 days/week = 42 kg/week

Now, we add the total amount of dog food needed for the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs in a week:
105 kg/week (for German Shepherds) + 42 kg/week (for Bulldogs) = 147 kg/week

So, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is 147 kilograms."

   - Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:**
   - Elvis drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Determine the net distance from Elvis's house:**
   - Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east.
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
   - Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To solve this, let's break it down year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - To find 30% of $9000, we calculate: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - To find 30% of $6300, we calculate: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - To find 20% of $4410, we calculate: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

So, after the three years, the boat is worth **$3528**."
"First, let's find out how many orange candies there are. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies, we have:

\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ orange candies} \]

Next, let's find out how many yellow candies there are. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies, we have:

\[ \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ yellow candies} \]

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can find out how many pink candies there are by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

\[ 232 - (54 + 108 + 27) = 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, the number of pink candies is 43.

"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out how much one bus trip costs. The problem states that each bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:
\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, then before dropping the marbles, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. So, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

We know Dallas got 25 marbles, so the number of marbles Darla got is the total given minus what Dallas got. So, Darla got 27 - 25 = 2 marbles.

"First, let's find out how old Emma is. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, and Mia is younger, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 years to Mia's age:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now we know Mia is 40 years old and Emma is 56 years old. To find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and then divide by 2:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

So, the final numerical answer is 48 years."

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate 36 * 0.50 = 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds of a small sunflower and a large sunflower together: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

So, the final numerical answer is 90."
"First, let's find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3.

Timothy's pens = 18 * 3 = 54 pens

Now, Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, we need to find half of Timothy's 54 pens.

Sarah's pens = 54 / 2 = 27 pens

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert and Albert is 36"" tall, Anne is:

\[ 36"" \times 2 = 72"" \]

Now, Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is:

\[ 72"" - 2"" = 70"" \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so before summer, she was:

\[ 70"" - 3"" = 67"" \]

So, the final numerical answer is 67."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), the company will produce:
   \[
   5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money the company will receive for selling these 70000 bars. Since each bar is sold for $2, the total money received will be:
   \[
   70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 140000 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts.

Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. So, for the first T-shirt, he pays the full price, which is $8. For the second T-shirt, he only pays 50% of the price, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes.

The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40. So, he only pays 60% of the original price, which is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the final numerical answer is:
36"
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. He gets $6 each week, so:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So Ryan has $18.

Next, let's calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

So Ryan spent $5 on ice cream cones. Now let's subtract that from his total money:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Now Ryan has $13 left. The movie tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

So Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

For 1 jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound

Now, let's calculate the cost of each ingredient:
- Passion fruit cost: 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit cost: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey cost: 2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's add up the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, the profit for one jar is:
- Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the profit for 10 jars:
- Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is:
$60"

"First, let's calculate how many cookies Randy had initially:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

Next, Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:

"First, let's find out how many toy soldiers are in each half of Matthew's collection. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of that would be:

12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half (6 toy soldiers), so for these 6 toy soldiers, the buyer would pay:

6 * $5 = $30

For the other half (also 6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy, so for these 6 toy soldiers, the buyer would pay:

6 * $7 = $42

Now, to find out how much money Matthew would earn in total, we add the two amounts together:

$30 + $42 = $72

So, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, let's find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Norman High School enrollment} \]

Given that Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of students at Butler High School:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School enrollment} - \text{Butler High School enrollment} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1000 \]"

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather:
  - 16 test tubes
  - 7 beakers
  - 14 Petri dishes

- Igor gathered:
  - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
  - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
  - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

- Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Total items Igor should have placed:
\[ 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 \]

Igor actually placed 29 items on the lab bench. To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to determine the difference between the total number of items he should have placed and the number he actually placed:
\[ 37 - 29 = 8 \]

So, Igor lost 8 beakers.

"First, let's find out how many legs there are in total. James is putting together 4 tables and each table has 4 legs. So, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table:

4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs

Each leg needs 2 screws. So, we multiply the total number of legs by the number of screws per leg:

16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws he needs from the number of screws he has:

40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to know how many eggs are in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

Number of eggs in the second basket = 2 × Number of eggs in the first basket
Number of eggs in the second basket = 2 × 10
Number of eggs in the second basket = 20

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
Total number of eggs = 10 + 20
Total number of eggs = 30

So, the final numerical answer is 30."

"First, let's understand the information given:

1. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron took 16 minutes to run his part of the race.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran 2 miles (because 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles).

Now, we know that Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate how fast Aaron is compared to Vanessa.

If Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, then in 1 minute, Aaron runs 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 mile per minute.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa runs each mile in 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa takes 1/4 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, she would take 4 * (1/4) = 1 minute.

So, Vanessa took 1 minute to complete her part of the race.

"First, let's calculate how much line the caretaker needs for the docks. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, he needs:

3 feet of line per foot of dock * 200 feet of dock = 600 feet of line

Now, he already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line he needs:

600 feet of line needed - 6 feet of line he already has = 594 feet of line

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
4. James is now 18 years old, and he was born when his father John was 19. So, James is 19 years younger than John.
5. To find out John's current age, we add 19 years to James' age: 18 + 19 = 37 years old.
6. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.
7. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"First, let's find out how much Mark paid for the radiator after the discount.

The original price of the radiator is $400. He gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Mark paid $80 for the radiator.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours.

The cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step:

1. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.
2. We also know that the total number of animals is 20 and the total number of legs is 70.

Let's assume:
- \( x \) is the number of chickens.
- \( y \) is the number of cows.

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. \( x + y = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2x + 4y = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ x + 2y = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 20 \)
2. \( x + 2y = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ x + 2y - x - y = 15 \]
\[ y = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( y = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ x + 15 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 15 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.
