"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed: 2 bolts.
2. Determine the amount of white fiber needed: half the amount of blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.
3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber needed: the sum of the blue and white fiber. This is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) bolts.

So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then adds $50,000 in repairs, making the total cost of the house $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The house's value increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$130,000 = 1.5 \times \$130,000 = \$195,000. \]

Adding this increase to the original cost of the house gives the new value:
\[ \$130,000 + \$195,000 = \$325,000. \]

Josh sells the house for $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the selling price:
\[ \$325,000 - \$130,000 = \$195,000. \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find out the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total meters run per sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters per sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters run per day:**
   James runs 3 sprints each day, so the total meters run per day is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/day} = 180 \text{ meters/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters run per week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total meters run per week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total feed in morning and afternoon} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[
\text{Total feed in morning and afternoon} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Since the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, the remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[
\text{Remaining feed} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, let's break down the cost for 16 glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

We can see that the cost pattern repeats every two glasses: $5, $3.

To find the total cost, we can calculate the cost for 16 glasses by summing up the costs in pairs:
\[ 16 \text{ glasses} = 8 \text{ pairs of glasses} \]

Each pair costs:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - (3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours) = 4 hours - 5.5 hours = -1.5 hours.
   - Since the time remaining is negative, it means he has already completed the journey.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
- Distance from first segment: 180 miles
- Distance from second segment: 0 miles
- Distance from third segment: 15 miles
- Distance from fourth segment: 120 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Since John was initially 180 miles away from home and has traveled 315 miles, he is now 315 miles - 180 miles = 135 miles from home.

The final numerical answer is:
135 miles"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

1. Donuts: Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
   \[
   3 \times 68 = 204
   \]
   So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

2. Mini cupcakes: Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160
   \]
   So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

3. Mini cheesecakes: Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
   \[
   6 \times 55 = 330
   \]
   So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is $694. 

\[
\boxed{694}

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find out when this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90.

So, we set up the inequality:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

This means that after the 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, the remaining number of students is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

This means that after the 4 students enrolled in jazz dance, the remaining number of students is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
  - Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
  - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}

"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired = 3 hours
   - Remaining time = Total time desired - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

"To determine how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after the spill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.
2. Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.
3. Determine the total amount of water after the spill.
4. Calculate the total amount of liquid after the spill.
5. Determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of water after the spill.**

Initially, the total amount of water is:
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the total amount of water remains the same (since only the orange drink was spilled):
\[ \text{Total water after spill} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of liquid after the spill.**

The total amount of liquid after spilling 1 liter of the orange drink is:
\[ \text{Total liquid after spill} = 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 5: Determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.**

Since the total amount of water remains the same after the spill, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \text{Water in remaining 24 liters} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To express this as a decimal:
\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{47}{3}} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered as \( x \). The cost of \( x \) boxes of pizza is:
\[ 8.50x \]

The total cost of all the items is given as $50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 8.50:
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of \(\boxed{243}\) dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period she is buying ice cream.

\[
\text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream.

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance of the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance of the second stop: 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles, the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start.
4. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop: 45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles.

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles.

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we sum up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Next, we find the average by dividing the total sum by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day.
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

2. Calculate the total hours John spends on all dogs per day.
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Total hours per day = 10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day.

3. Calculate the total hours John spends on all dogs per week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"First, let's determine how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. We know that in the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes to the points scored in the second 20 minutes to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sets of 4 yogurts in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4.
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets of 4 yogurts:**
   Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   \[
   15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games to the money he has left.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that John initially had $195 from selling his lego sets. To find out how much money he spent, we subtract the money he has left from the total money he had.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 165 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John spent $165 on video games and he has $5 left, the calculation confirms that he indeed spent $165.

Finally, since John started with 13 lego sets and he has not sold or bought any more lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days, with the first day being 3 hours and the other two days being half as long as the first day.

First, let's calculate the running time for the other two days:
- The first day he runs for 3 hours.
- The second and third days he run for half as much time as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total running time for the week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

We know that John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Suzy's iPhone:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces of pie.

"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can confirm that the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50g (because 300g / 5 servings = 60g/serving), the amount of chips that can be eaten is:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams/serving} = 40 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's determine how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used:**
   Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.

2. **Determine the initial number of Post-it notes:**
   Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

3. **Calculate the number of Post-it notes remaining after using some:**
   After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

4. **Find the total number of Post-it notes before purchasing the new package:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. Initially, she had 80 Post-it notes, and after purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes.

5. **Set up the equation based on the remaining notes:**
   After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 remaining:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   x - 140 = 23
   \]
   \[
   x = 23 + 140

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per day is:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, the daily revenue is:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{294} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact time it takes for him to travel back.

If we assume that the distance to his destination is \(D\) miles, then the time it takes to travel to the destination is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time to destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

The time it takes to travel back is given by:

\[ \text{Time to return} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the question does not provide the distance \(D\), we cannot provide a numerical answer. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined with the given information."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Annual pension for the next 10 years = 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the annual pension for the next 10 years, which is $50,000 per year.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000.

The final numerical answer is:

5. **Salary After Additional 3 Years**: Since the salary increase is only applicable after five years of service, Sylvie's salary will remain at $660 per month for the next three years.

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be:
\[
\text{Annual Salary} = 660 \times 12 = 7920
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7920}

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8000 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:
\[ \text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both adults and children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:
\[ 4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28 \text{ pets} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 28 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey is 2 years older than Amy).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Use Lee's original time to find Gerald's original time.
3. Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means that Gerald can now run the same distance in 90% of the time it took him before. So, we calculate 90% of Gerald's original time:

\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats in the neighborhood and then find the total number of pets.

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know that there are two cats for every dog.
   - Given that the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
   - First, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
     \[
     \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
     \]
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets:
     \[
     \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
     \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, we calculate:

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find the difference in the number of hours Harry slept compared to James:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[
3

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes was \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \).

2. **Convert the volume of tomatoes to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces, we divide 64 by 16:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit.

The total number of cars originally on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is the original number minus the cars that drove through and the cars that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 + 5) = \text{number of cars remaining} \]

Since the number of cars remaining on the motorway is not specified, we can infer that the problem is asking for the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, which is \( x \).

Given the information, we can set up the equation:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 + 5) = \text{number of cars remaining} \]
\[ 30 - (x + 25) = \text{number of cars remaining} \]
\[ 30 - x - 25 = \text{number of cars remaining} \]
\[ 5 - x = \text{number of cars remaining} \]

Since the number of cars remaining is not specified and we are only asked for the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we can conclude that the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary receives 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family tomorrow. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she will give away from her total number of plants:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings each friend pressed and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of rings from all friends:
\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 2 glasses of water per day on weekends.

So for 2 weekend days:
\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 4 \text{ glasses} = 24 \text{ glasses} \]

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, we can find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city and then multiply by the time it takes to cover each segment.

First, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles:
\[
\frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
\]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time to cover the entire city is:
\[
14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}

1. **Calculate the number of pieces Poppy places:**
   Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces after Poppy} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pieces her mom places:**
   Her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by her mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after her mom places her pieces:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces after her mom} = 750 - 250 = 500

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we will multiply the volume of one box by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of the box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

Here's the breakdown of the hours he watched TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's sum up the hours:
\[ 1 \text{ hour (Monday)} + 1 \text{ hour (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Friday)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the calculated hours is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since the extra hour he watched is from the 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes make up 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, and each 30-minute episode is 30 minutes, he watched:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per episode}} = 2 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( x = 50 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"First, let's determine how many seconds it took Julia to row 64 seconds away from the shore. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate of her rowing:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - According to the problem, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - According to the problem, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6

   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = \$100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = \$80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (since prices have gone up by 50%): \(10 \times 15 = \$150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (since prices have gone up by 50%): \(5 \times 24 = \$120\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$150 + \$120 = \$270 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$270 - \$180 = \$90 \]

So, Sasha makes a profit of:
\[ \$90 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts is sugar. Since sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the fraction of the total used for sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\).

We can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total amount of sugar and water by the fraction that represents the sugar:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 120 \times \frac{7}{20}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
120 \times \frac{7}{20} = 120 \times 0.35 = 42
\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

**Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.**

The customs officer initially counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.**

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.**

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as \( 1.3L \).
   - Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     1.3L = 40000
     \]
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
     \]

2. **Determine Adrien's Salary Four Years Later:**
   - Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, his new salary is:
     \[
     40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
     \]

3. **Determine Lylah's Salary Four Years Later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's.
   - Therefore, her new salary is:
     \[
     30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later:**
   - The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
     \[
     56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
     \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.
   - Therefore, the number of sheets used per week is \(2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}\).

2. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month.
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the number of sheets used per month is \(60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}\).

So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought:

- Morisette brought 5 apples.
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples Morisette brought, so Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Morisette brought 8 oranges.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges Morisette brought, so Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:

- Morisette brought \(5\) apples and \(8\) oranges, so she brought \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits.
- Kael brought \(10\) apples and \(4\) oranges, so he brought \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits.

Finally, to find the total number of fruits they brought together, we add Morisette's and Kael's fruits:

\[ 13 + 14 = 27 \]

So, the total number of fruits they have is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down the problem day by day and then sum the hours.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours for each day of the week:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 7 \text{ (Friday)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

"First, let's calculate how far Rosie runs in the initial 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts of her run:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped.
2. Determine the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started stamping.

First, Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters:
\[
\text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters were stamped by Jennie.

Next, we know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started stamping is:
\[
\text{Number of already-stamped letters before Jennie started} = 30 - 20 = 10

4. After these actions, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of spoons Julia had after all the transactions:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper:**
   Given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total cost for 4 watermelons:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each patient is seen for 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
- Therefore, the revenue from each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.
- The total revenue from 500 patients is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost to the hospital:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each patient is seen for 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Therefore, the cost to the hospital from each patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.
- The total cost from 500 patients is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Total revenue = $40,000
- Total cost = $30,000
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital's profit from these visits is \(\boxed{10000}\)."
"First, we start with the total number of elves hired, which is 60.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means 20 elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves remaining is:
\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract these 10 elves from the 40 remaining elves:
\[
40 - 10 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of elves left is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Wednesday is:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, we know that John harvests his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 1000 pineapples per harvest and he has 4 harvests in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, she sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave as she saw leave in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine who will finish the race first and by how much time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from the school to their respective homes.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)

Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who finishes in 36 minutes, and the loser is Tim, who finishes in 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:

\(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for bicycles + Cost for tricycles + Cost for the unicycle
- Total cost = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon stole the fries, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate the fries, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate the fries, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries initially had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours spent on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours spent on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours spent on all the days:
- Total hours in one semester = Hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays + Hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Total hours in one semester = \(144 + 128 = 272\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the lengths of the croissants and baguettes are given in inches, and the rolls are given in inches as well.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 2 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana consumption for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back).
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months. 
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Each price increase is by 120% of the previous price. This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by 1.20. We need to find the price after 18 such increases.

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**: If the initial price is \( P_0 \), the price after \( n \) increases is given by:
   \[
   P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n
   \]
   Here, \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \).

6. **Substitute the Values**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

7. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

8. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of the 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of the 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is:

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90, which is less than the $105 missed income. Therefore, hiring the accountant will result in more money for Jackie.

The amount of money Jackie will have more if she hires the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost of the hat and jacket} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato. 

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we can calculate the total time for each task separately and then sum them up.

**Time to peel all 60 potatoes:**
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

**Time to cut all 60 potatoes:**
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ 95 \text{ minutes} \]

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Profit per gallon is:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the given information:
- Zaid's monthly salary: $6000
- Rent: \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary
- Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary
- Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel
- Amount given to daughter: $200
- Amount given to wife: $700

First, calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
\]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
\]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
\]

Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
\]

Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
\]

Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350
\]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will have left is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of crabs Monic has.
2. Determine the number of crabs Rani has.
3. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Monic has} = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Next, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
\]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[
\text{Total number of crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}

"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to find out how many votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

According to the problem:
- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
- Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \):
\[
5w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
3. Two years ago, Mark's age was \(5\) years less than half of Jan's age at that time. So, Mark's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} - 5 = 14 - 5 = 9\).
4. Since two years ago Mark was 9 years old, his current age is \(9 + 2 = 11\).
5. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \(11 + 2 = 13\).

Therefore, Jean is 13 years old.

\[
\boxed{13}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each team member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 team members.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in the total times:
- Difference = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then find the difference in their likelihoods expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in likelihoods
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in their probabilities, expressed as a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{25\%}

"To find out how many apples Jenna and her mother picked together, we start by determining how many apples Jenna picked. According to the problem, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Since her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples they picked together:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of apples they both picked is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the total cost of $102 is to be split evenly among the three friends, each friend will pay:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the net increase in trees each year:**
   - Tom plants 10 trees.
   - Tom chops down 2 trees.
   - Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

2. **Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years:**
   - Tom starts with 50 trees.
   - Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is 8 trees per year.
   - Total increase over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
   - Total number of trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

3. **Account for the trees that die:**
   - 30% of the trees die after 10 years.
   - Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives the total amount Mark makes in a week:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is:

- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \text{ cakes}
\]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:
\[
\boxed{76}

"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts to solve it step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 6 plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - $1200 less than this amount is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - The total cost of buying 240 cups is $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of each cup is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after considering her initial savings.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the additional money she needs to earn is \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation:
\[4x = 60\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{60}{4} = 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs a day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, the problem states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set the right-hand sides of these equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the current amounts are positive and the equations should be consistent. Let's solve the system again carefully:

From \( B = 4S \) and substituting into \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. 

To verify, if \( S = 8 \), then \( B = 4S = 32 \). Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) (which is not possible, so we need to recheck the setup again carefully).

Rechecking the setup, we find the correct interpretation is:
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Given that there are 4 roses and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3.
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's score can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount of the remaining water in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

First, we know the company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year. So, we calculate a third of $15000:
\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]
Thus, the company spent $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Next, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total:
\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:
\[
\boxed{20000}

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To determine how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces to the puzzle and then determine the total time required.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add per minute together.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is:
\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Together, they can add:
\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the first batch home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate how many of these were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the subtotal before registration fees.

\[
\text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark also needs to pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the subtotal to get the total amount Mark pays.

"To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean.
2. Calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave.
3. Subtract the sum of these two groups from the total number of penguins.

First, we calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins jump into the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave. Since another one-third of the 36 penguins go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we find the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing by adding the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the number that went into the cave:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]
So, 24 penguins are no longer sunbathing.

Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of penguins to find out how many are still sunbathing:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \boxed{12}."

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine produces in a week. The problem states that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce in a week:
\[ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{14}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many whole pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, calculate the total number of slices needed:
- John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices needed is \(20 \times 4 = 80\) slices.

Next, determine how many whole pizzas are required:
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- To find out how many pizzas are needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(80 \div 8 = 10\).

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses five empty pens to make one new pen, he effectively uses 5 pens to get 1 new pen.

Let's break down the process step by step:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 20 pens (25 - 5 + 1 = 21 pens).
- He can repeat this process with the remaining 21 pens. Using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 16 pens (21 - 5 + 1 = 17 pens).
- He can repeat this process with the remaining 16 pens. Using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 12 pens (16 - 5 + 1 = 12 pens).
- He can repeat this process with the remaining 12 pens. Using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 7 pens (12 - 5 + 1 = 8 pens).
- He can repeat this process with the remaining 8 pens. Using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 3 pens (8 - 5 + 1 = 4 pens).
- He can repeat this process with the remaining 3 pens. Using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 0 pens (3 - 5 + 1 = -2 pens, but since he can't have negative pens, he stops here).

So, the total number of pens Ram can have is the sum of the pens he started with and the new pens he made:

\[ 25 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each girl based on the information given.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we add the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Let's perform the addition:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:

"First, let's determine the number of students who left through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

This means that 300 students left through exit A. Therefore, the number of students remaining after exit A is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 700 students left through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

This means that 420 students left through exit B. Therefore, the number of students remaining after exit B is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students, which is 280, must have left through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.

Thus, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages, so he writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss:
- Jason makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

\[
15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the extra minutes he used for other people this month:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since there are \( F \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires makeup done 4 times a week for 6 hours each time, and the movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 4 times/week * 6 hours/day * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, Sue ate:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, Sue ate:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue are:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

And the total calories consumed by her sister are:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

"Let's define the variables for the number of apples and bananas Jamal has:

- Let \( A_J \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( B_J \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_A = A_J + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_A = 52 \).
3. Therefore, \( 52 = A_J + 8 \), which means \( A_J = 52 - 8 = 44 \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( B_J = A_J + 4 \).
5. So, \( B_J = 44 + 4 = 48 \).

Now, we need to find the number of bananas Andrea has. According to the problem, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
\[ B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24. \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 118000 \]"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Additional time} = 0.40 \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time to heat to 400 degrees} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Cooking time} = 28 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to heat to 300 degrees} + \text{Time to heat to 400 degrees} + \text{Cooking time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 71 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
71

"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum them up.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to get the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

\[
\boxed{762}

"To determine the total number of windows in John's two houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To find out how much change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of the laundry is $9.45.
The cost of the package of pasta is $1.35.

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the remaining stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of stitches remaining for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stitches per sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   - Add the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them. The remaining cards after removing those with letters A, B, and C are those with the letter D:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream bars} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ice cream bar} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining length for sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Determine the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it needs to cover the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

However, she takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she earns in 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the extra point: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the extra point: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}
\]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
\[ 100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220 \]

**Total Squats:**
\[ 50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90 \]

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
\[ 20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \]

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
\[ 220 \text{ (pushups)} + 90 \text{ (squats)} + 60 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 370 \]

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{370} \]"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the household and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each day they consume:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold on these days:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - The opening bid is $200.
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350.

Carmen wins the auction after her fourth bid. Therefore, the total amount she paid is the sum of her bids:

\[
200 + 250 + 300 + 350
\]

Let's calculate this sum:

\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print one side of a page. So, for a 32-page tabloid, we need 16 layers of paper (since each layer can print one side of a page, and 32 pages mean 16 sides).

2. **Number of Pieces of Paper**: Since each layer of paper is a separate piece, we need 16 pieces of paper to create 16 layers.

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Now, we need to calculate the total amount spent:

\[
25 + 10 = 35
\]

Annika initially had $50. After spending $35, the amount left is:

\[
50 - 35 = 15

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books, so the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
3. This year, she sold 45 books.
4. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
5. The total number of books sold over the three years is \(90 + 45 + 200 = 335\), but since she only had 250 books, this means she sold all the books she had.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year. The price per book is $20, and she sold 45 books this year.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 900 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $900.

\[
\boxed{900}

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we need to add this bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we calculate how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the savings from the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 extra arms grow in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, 3 extra legs grow in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
   \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the expenses already calculated from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \$1950 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1950 \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. Let's denote the number of electric poles by \( P \) and the number of electric wires by \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people remaining at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Since the problem asks for the number of women left, and we know that 8 women stayed, the number of women left is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[ 3x = 24 \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of both the cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the milliliters weaker.

Therefore, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to understand the exchange rate: 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded by multiplying the number of new records by the number of old records required to trade for one new record.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know the monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so the monthly salary for each senior programmer is:
\[
\text{Monthly salary for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salaries for junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

\[

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charge that remains to be added.

The phone is currently at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge. Therefore, the remaining charge needed is:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

The cell phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. To find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge the phone by 40 percentage points, we perform the following calculation:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how much the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.
3. Calculate the discount from the coupon.
4. Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.**

The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip. Since they earned $4 in rewards, they used $4 off their next purchase.

**Step 3: Calculate the discount from the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the discount from the coupon is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.**

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. After applying the $4 in rewards, the price becomes:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, the coupon takes an additional $8 off the price:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- State tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have:
\[ \boxed{6} \] guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they were making them:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they are making them:

5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, we sum up the durations of all the activities:
\[ 1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Peyton will spend on her after-work activities is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and the daisies require 30 plant pots, the roses will need:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 \text{ (daisies)} + 60 \text{ (roses)} = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over after purchasing the required 90 plant pots, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number she already had:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots} \]

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. After saving some money, she spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother. The equation representing the situation is:

\[ 36 - S - 11 - 4 = 0 \]

This equation simplifies to:

\[ 36 - S - 15 = 0 \]

\[ 21 - S = 0 \]

\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet tall. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

\[ \$12 \text{ (toy cars)} + \$5 \text{ (teddy bears)} = \$17 \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of a round of mini-golf:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of one round of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

3. **Cost of riding the go-karts twice:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per go-kart ride} = \$10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost for two go-kart rides} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

4. **Total cost of all activities:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of one round of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost for two go-kart rides}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$5 + \$20 = \$30
   \]

5. **Remaining budget after the activities:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

6. **Number of friends she can invite:**
   Since each friend will get $5 in arcade tokens, the number of friends she can invite is:
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per friend's tokens}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Therefore, the amount of money she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

If she saves this amount for 5 days, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since this is half of his change, his total change is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as an equation:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = S \]
\[ 25 = S \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

This fraction represents the fraction of a day between services. To find the number of days between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train cannot go for a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and the stuffing required for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. On Friday, 4 boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need the total score for all three tests to be at least 42 points. Let \( x \) represent the score Jane needs on her third test. The equation representing the total score for all three tests is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

We already know the sum of the first two tests:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for various reasons is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + (3 \times (4C - 5)) = 50. \]

Substituting \( C = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + (4 \times 3 - 5) + (3 \times (4 \times 3 - 5)) = 50, \]
\[ 3 + 12 - 5 + 3 \times 7 = 50, \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers kicked out minus the number kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. So, we calculate the points Erin has after scoring 14 points:

\[ \text{Points Sara has} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Points Erin has after scoring 14 points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after already having some points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from the 24 points she had after scoring:

\[ \text{Points Erin had before} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched for an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   \[

2. **Thursday's practice:**
   Hallie had dance practice for 2 hours on Thursdays.

3. **Saturday's practice:**
   Hallie's Saturday practice lasted twice as long as her Tuesday practice. Since her Tuesday practice was 1 hour, her Saturday practice was:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum up the practice hours for each day:
\[
1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:
\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4 \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Next, we need to find the number of functioning pieces. Since the total number of pieces is the sum of the faulty and functioning pieces, we can express the number of functioning pieces as:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = \text{Total number of pieces} - \text{Number of faulty pieces} \]

The total number of pieces can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the cost per piece. However, since we don't know the cost per piece directly, we can use the percentage of faulty pieces to find the number of functioning pieces directly. The number of functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = \text{Total number of pieces} - 0.4 \times \text{Total number of pieces} = 0.6 \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Since the total cost is $400,000, the total number of pieces is:
\[ \text{Total number of pieces} = \frac{400000}{\text{Cost per piece}} \]

But we don't need the exact cost per piece to find the number of functioning pieces. We know that the number of functioning pieces is 60% of the total number of pieces. Therefore, the total cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:
\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
3. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep. These 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.
4. **Milk from the first half**: 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
5. **Milk from the second half**: 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day:
\[
1 \, \text{kg} + 2 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to determine the total number of bread rolls Mrs. Sherman made. Since a dozen is equal to 12, she made 12 bread rolls.

Next, she gave one roll to each of her 6 children. Therefore, she gave away 6 rolls, leaving her with \(12 - 6 = 6\) rolls.

Each of the remaining 6 rolls was broken into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is calculated by multiplying the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into:
\[ 6 \text{ rolls} \times 8 \text{ pieces per roll} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. We can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount of money received by the price per apple:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day:

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

1. Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

2. Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks.

3. Adding the socks from the pairs and the loose socks gives:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

4. Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
   \[
   50 \text{ total socks} - 35 \text{ washed socks} = 15 \text{ socks missed}

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then determine the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (R) = 10% per year = 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 150 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 150 = 3800 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Axel's friend Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can write this as:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can determine how many popsicles each person has by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio and then multiplying by the respective parts of the ratio.

First, we find the value of one part of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles Betty has:
\[
\text{Popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

Then, we calculate the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[
\text{Popsicles Sam has} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up all the time spent on each task:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying the additional cannolis. So, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = \text{New number of cannolis} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Adding these 60 corns to the initial number of corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

Finally, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new total number of corns and the new total number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 140 + 100 = 240 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

3. **Additional Steps**: He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.

4. **Remaining Steps**: After these steps, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total steps taken so far are:
   \[
   5,000 \text{ (from school and home)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} + 2,000 \text{ (remaining steps)} = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During Jog**: To find the steps taken during his jog, we subtract the total steps taken so far from the total goal:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ (total goal)} - 8,000 \text{ (total steps taken)} = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}

"First, we need to determine the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. The number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[
     6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in June:
     \[
     4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in both May and June:**
   - Total amount paid in May: $96000
   - Total amount paid in June: $72000
   - Total amount paid in both months:
     \[
     96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with the following pricing: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she pays $3/2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The cost of the taffy is $4.50, the cost of the seashells is $6.00, and the cost of the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00. Adding these together, the total cost is $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $11.50, she would be $11.50 - $10 = -$1.50. This means Sally is $1.50 short of the amount she needs to buy all the items. Therefore, she does not have enough money to buy everything she wants.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1.50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. Each pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 5 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 5% of the dangerous candles also explode.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \text{ dangerous candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the dangerous candles have this defect:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \text{ candles} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each camel has 1 head and each dromedary has 1 head, so the total number of heads is \( C + D = 180 \).
2. Each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of humps is \( 2C + D = 304 \).

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
C + D = 180 \\
2C + D = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2C + D - C - D = 124
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[
124 + D = 180
\]
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 800 km.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- Distance for the first 4 days: 800 km.
- Distance for the next 2 days: 240 km.
- Distance for the next day: 0 km.
- Distance for the second week: 2100 km.

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is \( 40 \) cubic inches.

\[
\boxed{40}

"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 3000."
"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17000 \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\). Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$112 = \$184

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 and the original cost of the tattered jeans was $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder. The bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Let's denote the number of birds attracted by each store-bought feeder as \( x \). Therefore, each bird feeder she made attracts \( x + 10 \) birds.

Since she has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 made feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is \( 3x \) and the total number of birds attracted by the made feeders is \( 3(x + 10) \).

The total number of birds attracted by all the feeders is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and made feeders:
\[ 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3x + 3x + 30 = 6x + 30. \]

We know from the problem statement that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, so \( x = 20 \). Substituting \( x = 20 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 6(20) + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150. \]

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price.
   \[
   \text{25% of the bagel's price} = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the soup} = 4 + 1 = 5

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards:**
   Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   The cost of the ticket to the amusement park is $100. Since Kenny only has $50 after spending, the amount he made from selling the cards is:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   Kenny sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{50 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 cards.

4. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards he started with. Therefore, the 33 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his original collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Cards} = 33
   \]
   Solving for the total number of cards:
   \[
   \text{Total Cards} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 49.5
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 49 cards.

Thus, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. There were 36 guests, and he prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs each. Therefore, the caterer prepared:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means a total of:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs} \]

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, there are not enough hotdogs for everyone to have a second one. The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"

"First, let's determine how many dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container contains:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then use that information to find out how many candy bars he bought.

First, let's determine how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, this means he spent 99% of his money. Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as \( x \). Therefore, 99% of \( x \) is $5:
\[ 0.99x = 5 \]
\[ x = \frac{5}{0.99} \approx 5.0505 \]

Next, we calculate how much money George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount of money he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:
\[ 5.00 - 1.20 = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, we take the integer part of the division, which is 5. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory and her mom have eaten. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have eaten a total of 2 pieces.

The weight of the cake they have eaten is:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining weight of the cake is:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs \(\boxed{15}\) ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so we need to find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:
\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. We do this by subtracting the time Bernadette takes to drive from the time Wayne takes to drive:
\[
\text{Time difference} = \text{Time for Wayne's drive} - \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 - 16 = -12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since Bernadette needs to leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We can substitute the known values into this formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the length and width we found:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven being on for 3 hours. Since the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, the total increase in temperature is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after 3 hours of baking is:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the temperature decrease due to the window being open for 30 minutes. The window causes a 2-degree decrease every 10 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature is:
\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature of the house after the window is opened for 30 minutes is:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( R \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ \text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Then, we determine the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from the department store is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 48 \times \$12 = \$576 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons from each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and one soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 13 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, the number of sapphires she has left is:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies she received. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To determine the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24

"First, let's determine the number of fairies that joined Katelyn's initial count of 50 fairies. According to the problem, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Since Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies, half of that number is:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were initially there. The total number of fairies after these 25 fairies joined is:

\[
50 + 25 = 75
\]

Next, we need to account for the 30 fairies that flew away ten minutes later. Subtracting these 30 fairies from the total of 75 fairies gives:

\[
75 - 30 = 45
\]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 9."

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to first calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room:**
   Each room has 2 sheets.

2. **Comforters per room:**
   Each room has 1 comforter.

3. **Pillow cases per room:**
   Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since each room has 2 sheets, the number of pillow cases is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ pillow cases}
   \]

4. **Towels per room:**
   Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since each room has 4 pillow cases, the number of towels is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ towels}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry item per room:
\[
2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room}

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk over the three weeks.
2. Divide the total number of minutes needed to break in the shoes by the total number of days he will walk.

First, we know that three weeks is equal to 21 days (since 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the shoes. He plans to walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Now, we divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days he will walk:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429 \]

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).

We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens. The formula is:

\[ \text{Allergic to at least one} = (\text{Allergic to dairy}) + (\text{Allergic to peanuts}) - (\text{Allergic to both}) \]

Substituting the given numbers:

\[ \text{Allergic to at least one} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens. 

Given that there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20."

"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- Food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of a skein of yarn} \]

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, the total number of yards they used is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total cost of taking the bus without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 bus trips each day.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- So, the total cost for 10 bus trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we find the difference between the total cost without the pass and the cost of the pass:
- The savings would be \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Therefore, Janet would save \(\boxed{2.00}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation based on the relationship:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly consumption and cost for both scenarios.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device.**

- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost before adding the new device:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device.**

- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after adding the new device:
\[ \$21.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$147.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the weekly costs.**

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O \). Since \( C_O = 22 \), we have \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has \( S_O + C_O = 20 + 22 = 42 \).

"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

With $4, Tom could buy:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, let's establish the pattern:
- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, we calculate the total hours for each period:
- For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
  \[
  6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
  \]
- For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
  \[
  2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
  \]
- For the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours:
  \[
  1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of hours:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(70 - 21 + 7 = 56\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jame's current age and his cousin's age in 8 years, and then find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Find the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22 years.
   - Jame's cousin's current age is 57 years.
   - The difference in their current ages is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \) years.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Use the information about the seashells brought by the girls to find the number of seashells each girl brought.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Each boy brought 60 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save in the second half of April to meet his monthly target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month of April would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \( x = 25 \) dollars per day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Thus, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the cashier. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

3. Determine the reduction needed for Juan to meet the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee:
   \[
   \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2}
   \]

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks:
   \[
   \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R
   \]

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his intake from \( 5R \) to \( R \):
   \[
   \text{Reduction needed} = 5R - R = 4R
   \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction needed is:
\[
4R
\]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \(\boxed{4R}\) cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight of the three friends, we divide the total weight by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \) upward.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.
   - After 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees above the tip of the pyramid.
   - Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved upward:
     \[
     32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since James needs a candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 packs × $3/pack = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\]

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

Shiloh's current age is 44 years. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, the nephew's age will be:
\[ x + 7 \]

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of these teeth.
   \[
   1 \text{ tooth} \times \$1.00 = \$1.00
   \]
   Since there are three teeth, the total for these teeth is:
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. The amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00, so half of this amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = \$0.50
   \]
   Therefore, for each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. So, the total amount Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for wooden action figures is:

\[
4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[
70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Now, we need to determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[
4 + 25 = 29
\]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\boxed{29}
\]"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks):
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month by subtracting the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This operation involves adding half of the starting value to the starting value and then dividing the result by 5. Mathematically, this can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{S + \frac{S}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{20}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The result from the first operation (which is 6) is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12. Mathematically, this can be written as:
   \[
   6 \times (S - 12)
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is consistently off by 4%. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( T \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be \( T + 0.04T = 1.04T \). We know this should equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04T = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy initially bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy initially bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Cups:
- Judy initially bought 12 cups.
- Her friend brought 40 cups.
- Total cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\).

Dishes:
- Judy initially bought 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 44 dishes.
- Total dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Finally, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount:**
   - Each box is $100.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is \( 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \).
   - The discounted price per box is \( 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \).
   - For 2 boxes, the total cost is \( 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes:**
   - Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
   - Therefore, 2 boxes contain \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) pairs of contacts.

3. **Calculate the cost per pair of contacts:**
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00.
   - The total number of pairs of contacts is 180.
   - The cost per pair is \( \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \).

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

So, on Saturday:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

And on Sunday:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives John's total hours worked:
\[ \text{Total hours John worked} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's earnings:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans.
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans.
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

We can express these relationships mathematically:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

Finally, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the three measurements. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, after the lessons it increased to 52 WPM, and if he continues to increase his speed by 5 words per minute, his next speed will be 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we sum these three values and then divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]
First, we calculate the sum:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]
Next, we divide the sum by 3:
\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]
So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference in weight is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day and compare it to the height of the window.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. The height of the beanstalk doubles every day. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: \(4\) feet
- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the protein intake per day is 6 grams. To find out how much protein John gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \text{Protein intake per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is \( 30 \) degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is \( 90 \) degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's determine how many gumballs Colby can buy based on the value of his coins.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes * $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels * $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies * $0.01 = $0.15

Total value of Colby's coins: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Each gumball costs a nickel, which is $0.05. 

To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total value of his coins by the cost of one gumball:

\[ \frac{3.45}{0.05} = 69 \]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to find the plane's speed.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total amount of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract this from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday:**
   Howard spends $8 at the arcade.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Monday} = \$8
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Tuesday} = 2 \times \$8 = \$16
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Howard spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Wednesday} = 4 \times \$16 = \$64
   \]

Next, we sum the amounts spent over the three days:
\[
\text{Total spent} = \$8 + \$16 + \$64 = \$88
\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount:
\[
\text{Money left} = \$100 - \$88 = \$12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rotations the tires of Jeremy's car undergo in a month and then calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.

First, we calculate the number of rotations the tires make in one month. We know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:

\[
\text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
\]

\[
\text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per month:

\[
\text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months}
\]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years}
\]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash to cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

The total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discounted price of the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35, and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the outfit after the discount:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' and Monica's streets:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, it costs an additional \(\boxed{65560}\) dollars to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) are funded at 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 per 5 months.

   First, calculate the monthly funding for the initial 5 months:
   \[
   \text{Monthly funding for initial 5 months} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

   For the extended 45 months, the funding per month is 50% more:
   \[
   \text{Monthly funding for extended 45 months} = 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

   Now, calculate the total cost for the extended 45 months:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for extended 45 months} = 45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum the costs of the initial 5 months and the extended 45 months:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000 \text{ dollars}

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1,450,000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the beef tips is:
   \[
   8 \text{ tips} \times 1 \text{ ounce per tip} = 8 \text{ ounces}
   \]
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate:
   \[
   16 \text{ ounces}
   \]
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.**

Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
\[ \text{Total loads per year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of water used in a year.**

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
\[ \text{Total gallons of water used per year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.**

"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, we calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights at all 4 intersections. Since there are 24 street lights at each intersection and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Finally, we need to account for the 20 street lights that are not working. The number of functioning street lights is:

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces of gum} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:
\[ 1 \text{ piece on the way home} + 1 \text{ piece after dinner} = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews during the day is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces left is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed. So, he gives away:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert the speed to Mb per second as follows:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam is 40 inches tall, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate his current height in feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Total cost paid by the company} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we calculate the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Total cost paid by the company} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

   \[
   \text{Price of a diamond jewel} = \$2000
   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45
\]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is at most $10.

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{C}{n} \]

We need:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the daily average publications and the number of days in February.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day. Similarly, for 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

To find the total number of articles published by both websites together in February, we add the two totals:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

Thus, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Steve's family members.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, so her age is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is \(\frac{64}{2} = 32\) years.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the amount of flour in one bag by three to find the total amount of flour in three bags.

First, we know that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. Therefore, the amount of flour in one bag is calculated as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kg/bag} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is:

\[ 79 \, \text{miles} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[
\text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Depth of soil}}{\text{Rate of digging through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[
\text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Depth of clay}}{\text{Rate of digging through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:
\[

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

Next, we need to account for the additional 20000 likes she received recently. Adding these to the 140000 likes gives:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes on the photo is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - The total sales for the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales for the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales for the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales for the second month were \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month.
   - Total sales for the two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time period:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid time = Total time - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs for the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $105.

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld is the difference between what she should have earned and what she actually earned. So, we subtract her weekly wage from the amount she earned:

$220 - $300 = -$80

Since the result is negative, it indicates that $80 was withheld from her wage. Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since each deviled egg is made from 2 halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs required is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book if he reads 10 pages a day.

The total number of days required to read the book is given by the total number of pages divided by the number of pages he reads per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading. This is calculated by subtracting the total number of days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**

"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item based on the information provided.

1. **Rice Cooking Time:**
   - Given: 30 minutes.

2. **Pork Cooking Time:**
   - It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Therefore, pork cooking time = rice cooking time + 20 minutes.
   - Pork cooking time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Beans Cooking Time:**
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, beans cooking time = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the items:
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. Each sheep and each goose has one head, so the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive coffee:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day:
\[ \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee:
\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the donut is:
\[ \text{Total cost of donut} = \$2 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining 6 days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The first of these three days is good.
- The second is neutral.
- The third is good.

Adding these to the existing good days:
\[
8 \text{ (initial good days)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} = 10 \text{ good days}
\]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The total growth needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 8 + 8 = 16 dogs in total. Since he already has 4 toys, he needs 16 - 4 = 12 more toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. This means he had 16 - 3 = 13 dogs to care for, but he already had 4 toys, so he needed 13 - 4 = 9 more toys.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- 4 toys for the initial 8 dogs
- 12 toys for the 16 dogs after buying more
- 9 toys for the 13 dogs after 3 dogs left

The total number of toys James needs is 4 + 12 + 9 = 25.

The final numerical answer is:
25"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. We want to find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes.

The proportion can be set up as follows:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]
\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]
\[ x = 6 \times 96 \]
\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is 576."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight that Jack and the 8 other adults will be carrying.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, so 8 adults will weigh:
\[ 8 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Jack's weight is not specified, but since we are only concerned with the additional weight beyond the maximum load of the elevator, we can assume Jack's weight is negligible or not provided. Therefore, the total weight of the 8 adults is 640 kg.

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. The additional weight that will be carried is:
\[ 700 \text{ kg} - 640 \text{ kg} = 60 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{60} \text{ kg} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

From the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \), we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the relationship \( M = C + 12 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. Now we can find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[ M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

The total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half of the lawn separately and then sum them up.

First, let's convert the time for each mode into minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so we can write another equation:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know \( Tr = 6 \), we can find \( T \):

\[ T = Tr + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the five lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Now, determine the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Next, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

Then, calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years (120 months), Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[
H = 0.6T
\]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[
T = 40 + H
\]

Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \):

\[
T = 40 + 0.6T
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first isolate \( T \) on one side of the equation:

\[
T - 0.6T = 40
\]

\[
0.4T = 40
\]

\[
T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[
\text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[
\text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[
\text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[
5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[
12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[
7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[
\boxed{32}

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:
\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to raise that amount, assuming they raise an equal amount each hour.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]
4. They need to raise $4200 in the remaining hours, and they raise an equal amount each hour. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, they raise:
   \[
   \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
5. To find out how many additional hours they need to raise $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:
   \[
   \frac{4200}{700} = 6
   \]

So, they need to raise for an additional 6 hours. Adding the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to raise the money is:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]
   - Therefore, 32% of the total Colorado River water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]
   - Therefore, 8% of the total Colorado River water is used for non-industrial purposes by Colorado City.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the production rate for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops.

First, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- For 3 scoops, the cost is \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\) dollars.

Now, we divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[
\frac{6.00}{4.50} = 1.3333\ldots
\]

Since Erin can only buy whole sets of 3 scoops, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops. This means she will get 2 scoops paid for and 1 free scoop.

Next, we calculate the total number of scoops she can get:
- From 1 set of 3 scoops, she gets 2 scoops paid for and 1 free scoop.
- Therefore, she gets \(2 + 1 = 3\) scoops in total.

So, the final number of scoops Erin should buy is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over the two-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area.

First, calculate the area that needs to be covered:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet is:
\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

The fixed fee is $20.
The variable fee is $1.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds. So, the variable cost is:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the fixed and variable costs gives the total cost for picking the blueberries:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost is:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original total cost would be:

\[ 500 \text{ computers} \times \$700 \text{ per computer} = \$350,000 \]

Next, we need to find the new price of each computer, which is 10% higher than the original price. The original price per computer is:

\[ \$700 \]

A 10% increase in the price is calculated as:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$700 = 0.10 \times \$700 = \$70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ \$700 + \$70 = \$770 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers at the new price of \$770 each:

\[ 500 \text{ computers} \times \$770 \text{ per computer} = \$385,000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

- John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.
- The cheese is 2 oz, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.
- The ham is also 2 oz, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Adding these together, the total calories in the omelet are \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

1. The cost of fixing the pothole with asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75.
2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120.

So, the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

Ron will avoid $450 worth of damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed. 

Therefore, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is $450 - $195 = $255.

The final numerical answer is $255."

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ slices} \]

However, we need to be careful here because the slices eaten by the first group (Bryce and two friends) and the second group (the remaining two friends) overlap in the total slices eaten. Since the first group ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas and the second group ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas, we need to find the total slices eaten without double-counting.

The first group ate 40 slices, and the second group ate 45 slices, but since the second group ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas, we need to consider the overlap. The first group ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas, and the second group ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas, so the overlap is the slices eaten by the first group, which is 40 slices.

Therefore, the total slices eaten is:
\[ 40 + (45 - 40) = 40 + 5 = 45 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, the number of slices left is:
\[ 60 - 45 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \times 4 = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows. Therefore, the number of windows she smashes from the students' cars is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah also smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. Therefore, the number of windows she smashes from the teachers' cars is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars, we get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah:

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of her spools that are blue is:

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books to find the total weight Cindy is carrying:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C are the remaining votes after accounting for candidate A and candidate B.

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (\text{votes for candidate A} + \text{votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, after giving 10 apples to Beck, Boris will have:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Clara has two times as many books as Steven. We are given that Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2S = 20
\]

Solving for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[
A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We already know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[
20 - 16 = 4
\]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students like to play video games. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of students who like to play video games.
- \( y \) as the number of students who like to play music.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball:
   \[
   y = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

2. The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:
   \[
   10 + 5 + x + y = 50
   \]

Substituting \( y = 10 \) into the equation:
\[
10 + 5 + x + 10 = 50
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
25 + x = 50
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 50 - 25
\]
\[
x = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to determine how many birds were scared away by Jeremy throwing the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that number. We calculate \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 12 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week.

The total number of animals is:
\[ 8 \text{ (dogs)} + 5 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (birds)} + 12 \text{ (horses)} = 28 \text{ animals} \]

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ animals}}{7 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ animals per day} \]

So, the number of animals Melissa will groom each day of the week is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

"To determine how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Carl has.
2. Determine how many marbles Cal has.
3. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Next, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Now, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have to find the total:
\[
\text{Total number of marbles Carl and Cal have} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

1. Calculate the number of students per group if there are 12 groups:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
   \]
   Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 54 students is not possible. Therefore, we need to find out how many groups of 54 students can be formed if we need to have whole groups.

2. Determine the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students if each group must have an equal number of students. The possible group sizes are the divisors of 54. The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. Since we need to form 12 groups, we need to find the largest divisor of 54 that is less than or equal to 12. The largest such divisor is 9.

3. Calculate the number of groups if each group has 9 students:
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{9 \text{ students per group}} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]
   This means that 6 groups of 9 students each can be formed from 54 students.

4. Determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups:
   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental pattern and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
- There are 2 weekend days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 20 weekdays, the number of chairs rented is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 8 weekend days, the number of chairs rented is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is:
\[1200 + 800 = 2000\]

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \times 2 = 4000\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[

   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to determine how many pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Next, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Let the number of books Ahmed read be \( x \). According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so:
\[ 300 = 2x \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. The total number of books read by both is:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books read altogether is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$365 \]"
"To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, and then find the difference.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents each day. Since they have 4 vanilla scents available, the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/day} \times 1 \text{ day} = 5 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

The company sold 2 fruity scents each day. Since they have 8 fruity scents available, the total number of fruity scents sold is:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/day} \times 1 \text{ day} = 2 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, we calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He has 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \] wheels.

So, the number of wheels left is 276."

The original price of the laptop is $1000.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtracting this discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 800 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of movies in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

This means the number of non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

This means the number of non-older non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the non-series movies is $10 each. The cost of the older movies is $5 each. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
\[ \text{Cost of non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
\[ \text{Cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

So, Winston spent a total of $38.00 on fruit."
"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance driven is given by:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
The distance hiked is given by:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances driven and hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points Ava earns are:
\[ 10 \times E_A + 5 \times B_A + 30 \times (60 - 4) \]
\[ = 10 \times (E_E + 8) + 5 \times (B_E + 3) + 30 \times 56 \]
\[ = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + 1680 \]
\[ = 10E_E + 5B_E + 1795 \]

The points Emma earns are:
\[ 10 \times E_E + 5 \times B_E + 30 \times (60 - 4) \]
\[ = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30 \times 56 \]
\[ = 10E_E + 5B_E + 1680 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E_E + 5B_E + 1795) - (10E_E + 5B_E + 1680) \]
\[ = 1795 - 1680 \]
\[ = 115 \]

\[ \boxed{115} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
   \[
   30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Divide the combined cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas:

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
- They ride for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify this solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding these fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish (16) is indeed twice the number of white fish (8).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip is 10 miles per day. Therefore, in a week, he drives:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of 140 quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of 10 twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. During the night, the temperature drops to 33 degrees colder than during the day. Given that the day's temperature is 45 degrees, the night's temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. The difference between the night's temperature and the freezing point is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie earned from her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours on that day. Out of these, 8 hours are regular hours and the remaining 3 hours are additional hours.

The earnings from the regular hours are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

The earnings from the additional hours are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives Jamie's total earnings for the day:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work that day."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and then sum all the lions.

1. The number of female lions is given as 12.
2. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions. Therefore, the number of male lions is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]
3. The number of lion cubs is given as 14.

Now, we sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions:
\[
12 + 6 + 14 = 32
\]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To find out how much money Mike will have left after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40, and the jeans are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discounted price of the jeans is:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left, we subtract the discounted price of the jeans from $50:

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. So, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3120000 \]"
"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for each song and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
- It is sung twice.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \(150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}\).

Next, we calculate the time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
- It is sung once.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is \(240 \text{ seconds} \times 1 = 240 \text{ seconds}\).

Now, we sum the times for both songs:
- Total time = Time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Time for ""Jingle Bells""
- Total time = \(300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}\).

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's calculate Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary**: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours at each wage:
1. **Initial wage (20 hours)**: $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.
2. **After 2 months (20 hours)**: $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.
3. **On his first anniversary (20 hours)**: $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours over the entire period:
\[ 200 + 210 + 230 = 640 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage:
\[ 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Then, we calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
\[ 10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[ 640 - 210 = 430 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Billy will earn \(\boxed{430}\) dollars more than Sally."

Pierson's score = 278 points

Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139 points

Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150 points

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150 = 428 points

The final numerical answer is 428."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. So, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week, we get:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: \( 340 \)
- Fourth graders: \( 40 \)
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

Now, we sum the total number of students who passed:

\[ 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \]

The total number of students tested is:

\[ 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \]

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested:

\[ \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 70\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
70"
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Orders and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 butterscotch candies.

2. **Remaining Candies After Sales:**
   - Since he sold 150 candies out of the 100 he initially had, he would have sold more than he had ordered. This means he would have run out of candies and would not have any left to sell.
   - Therefore, Dale has 0 candies left to sell after the initial sales.

3. **Additional Orders:**
   - Dale then ordered 100 more butterscotch candies.

4. **Total Candies Dale Has Now:**
   - Dale now has 0 (remaining from initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 100 candies.

5. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - Dale needs to sell all 100 candies he currently has.

Thus, Dale still needs to sell **100** butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this is the total number of branches climbed over the entire week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total playtime and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the playtime for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total playtime for all four friends:
\[ 20 + 10 + 30 + 10 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows 20 minutes of play, we need to determine how many quarters are required for 240 minutes of play:

"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Thus, the total amount of money John spent is:

\[

Now, we need to convert the total time spent walking over the two days from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we calculate the total time in minutes as follows:
\[
8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot at the start of the lunch break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]
4. **Cars Remaining During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, calculate the daily earnings:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.

   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00
   \]

So, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars if he works a full 7-day week."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18.

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

The final numerical answer is 27."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we'll find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The cost for the weight is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost for the distance is \(20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Calculate the refund amount from Amazon:**
   - The purchase price of the book is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \(32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
   - The net loss is \(3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars}\).

Since the net loss is negative, it means Milly actually gains $21.00. Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:

"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production:**
   Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

6. **Fourth Week Production:**
   To find the production in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, Boris produces \(\boxed{14,000}\) bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos per week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = 120 minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the total time spent on makeup is \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on TikTok-related activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes (videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{1128 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{18.8 \text{ hours}} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost:**
   - The base cost for the installation is $129.00.
   - This includes:
     - 4 mirrors
     - 2 shelves
     - 1 chandelier
     - 10 pictures

2. **Additional Cost:**
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The additional cost is $15.00 per item.

Let's calculate the additional cost for the items Angela needs:

- **Mirrors:**
  - Additional mirrors needed: \( 6 - 4 = 2 \)
  - Additional cost for mirrors: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \)

- **Chandeliers:**
  - Additional chandeliers needed: \( 2 - 1 = 1 \)
  - Additional cost for chandeliers: \( 1 \times 15 = 15 \)

- **Pictures:**
  - Additional pictures needed: \( 20 - 10 = 10 \)
  - Additional cost for pictures: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \)

Now, let's sum up the additional costs:

- Total additional cost: \( 30 + 15 + 150 = 205 \)

Finally, we add the base cost to the total additional cost:

- Total cost: \( 129 + 205 = 334 \)

Thus, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{334}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{42.00}

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

First, let's establish the total distance of the highway. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate the total distance \(D\) as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
Let the speed of each kangaroo be \(v\). Then the total distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the same distance \(D\). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \(v/2\). Let \(t\) be the time it takes for the 4 turtles to cross the highway. The total distance \(D\) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2vt \]
Since the distance \(D\) is the same, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]
Solving for \(t\), we get:
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \]
So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by determining the number of dishes each person made based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by each person:
\[
20 \text{ (Kora)} + 40 \text{ (Rory)} + 80 \text{ (Jada)} = 140

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has:
\[ \text{Money from part-time job} + \text{Money from mom} + \text{Money in purse} = 150 + 80 + \text{Money in purse} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can set up the equation to find out how much money Erika has in her purse:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{Money in purse} = 350 \]
\[ 230 + \text{Money in purse} = 350 \]
\[ \text{Money in purse} = 350 - 230 \]
\[ \text{Money in purse} = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 of its length left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the glue that is not used is 2 millimeters.

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 of its length left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the glue that is not used is 8 millimeters.

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 of its length left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, as well as the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the 10-minute intermission to the total time for one group:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many groups can fit into the 120 minutes:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The original investment (principal) \( P \) is $300. The annual interest rate \( r \) is three-quarters of the original amount, which is:
\[ r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where \( I \) is the interest, \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( t \) is the time in years.

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 300 \times 6.75 = 2025 \]

The total amount \( A \) after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[ A = P + I = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm after the sales.

For Farm X:
- Initial number of goats: 55
- Goats sold: 10
- Goats remaining: \(55 - 10 = 45\)

For Farm Y:
- Initial number of goats: 45
- Goats sold: 20
- Goats remaining: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:

Total goats remaining = Goats remaining in Farm X + Goats remaining in Farm Y
\[ = 45 + 25 = 70 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 110 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- You get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the discount per basket is $2.
- Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we need to clean one-half of them, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
   \[

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. In the third year, the town builds double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   Then, the number of homes built in the third year is:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144
\]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T - 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + M + T = 87 \).

Since \( S = T - 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S + 2 \). Now, we can rewrite the sum of our ages equation as:
\[ S + B + (3B - 1) + (S + 2) = 87. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B + 1 = 87. \]
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B = 86. \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S + 2B = 43. \]
We also know from the first relationship that \( S = B - 3 \). Substituting \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 43 \), we get:
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 43. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B - 3 = 43. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 3B = 46. \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = \frac{46}{3} = 15.3333. \]
Since ages are typically whole numbers, let's recheck the problem constraints and calculations. Given the problem setup and the integer nature of ages, we should re-evaluate the integer solution. Let's assume \( B = 15 \) (a reasonable integer close to 15.3333):
\[ S = B - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12. \]
Now, we can find \( M \):
\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(15) - 1 = 45 - 1 = 44. \]
And \( T \):
\[ T = S + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14. \]
Adding all the ages:
\[ S + B + M + T = 12 + 15 + 44 + 14 = 85. \]
This is close but not exactly 87. Let's try \( B = 16 \):
\[ S = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47. \]
\[ T = S + 2 = 13 + 2 = 15. \]
Adding all the ages:
\[ S + B + M + T = 13 + 16 + 47 + 15 = 91. \]
This is too high. Let's try \( B = 14 \):
\[ S = B - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11. \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(14) - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41. \]
\[ T = S + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13. \]
Adding all the ages:
\[ S + B + M + T = 11 + 14 + 41 + 13 = 79. \]
This is too low. The correct integer solution is \( B = 15 \), \( S = 12 \), \( M = 44 \), \( T = 14 \):
\[ S = 12. \]
The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we can check the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to follow the changes in the water flow day by day.

"To determine how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people from the previous day.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, after Day 1, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

**Day 2:**
Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, after Day 2, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

**Day 3:**
Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]
So, after Day 3, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is:
\[ \boxed{3430} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount Rafaela received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received altogether:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"

"To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we need to first establish the number of badges each person earns in a year.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month, so Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges in a year.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Claire earns 12 badges in a year, so Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.**
Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

The total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ \text{Gold coins} = \text{Silver coins} + 30 \]

Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = \text{Gold coins} + \text{Silver coins} \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.

   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: 3 times the number of green cars.
   \[
   \text{Blue Cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total of Red, Green, and Blue Cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{28} \]"

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses they sold by 2:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, so the difference is:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how much money she will have left after selling the original rope.

Since the total cost of the original rope is $40, she will have:

\[
\text{Money left} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

With $0 left, Sarah cannot buy any new rope. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age first. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the concert time and the encore time, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the original number of toys he had.

Initially, Argo has 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

First, we calculate the total number of toys given away:
\[ 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired.
3. Divide the number of pairable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

First, we calculate 20% of the 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

Next, we subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total 50 microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 microphones can be paired.

Finally, we divide the 40 pairable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:
\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of a thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

First, we know the cost of the salad is $6. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the cost of the yogurt is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of one carrot be \( x \) dollars. Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of the carrots is:
\[ 2x \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of her daily diet is the sum of the cost of the carrots, the salad, and the yogurt:
\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Then we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is:

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that she earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and assuming she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, her earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x \]

Since her total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month were $80, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 6x + 6x = 80 \]

\[ 12x = 80 \]

\[ x = \frac{80}{12} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \]

Now, we calculate her earnings from mowing lawns:

\[ \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x = 6 \times \frac{20}{3} = 40 \]

Therefore, her earnings from lemonade sales are:

\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ rentals/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/rental} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so his profit is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Anis rowed.
2. Add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis.

First, we know that Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

Let's calculate \(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\):
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10
\]
So, Anis rowed:
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Material for 20 small masks = \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Material for 8 large masks = \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
  \[
  52 = 2(A - 4)
  \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[
52 = 2(A - 4)
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
26 = A - 4
\]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[
A = 30
\]

So, Adam's current age is 30.

Now, we need to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[
A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Thus, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday he completes:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he drinks:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, the total miles driven in a month is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups Jon will need for 3000 miles, given that his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. We do this by dividing the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon will need 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, the total amount given by their mother is $28, and this amount was split equally between Julia and Nadine. Therefore, each of them received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students combined. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Adding these together:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

\[

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of cups in each row is \( 2x \).

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that the remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

So, we have:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row, and there are \( x \) cups of mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ x = 2 \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total time available for picking berries**: 8 hours.
2. **Total berries to be picked**: 24 berries.
3. **Time taken for one trip**: 4 hours (down the tree, pick berries, and climb back up).

First, we calculate the time the sloth spends picking berries. Since the total time available is 8 hours and the time spent climbing up and down the tree is 4 hours each way, the time spent picking berries is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours (up)} - 4 \text{ hours (down)} = 0 \text{ hours} \]

This means the sloth can only pick berries during the 4 hours it takes to go down the tree and climb back up. Therefore, the sloth can only pick berries during this 4-hour period.

Next, we calculate the number of berries the sloth can pick in 4 hours. Since the sloth needs to pick a total of 24 berries in 8 hours, the number of berries picked per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{3 \text{ trips}} = 8 \text{ berries per trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\] dollars

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\] dollars

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4.2857\]

Since Colby can only see whole movies, he can see 4 more movies.

The final numerical answer is:
\[4\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's nephew has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of other toys from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person had initially:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons.
- Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.

So, the total number of water balloons before her mom gave more is \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:

- Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), her mom gave \(5 \times 3 = 15\) additional water balloons.

Adding the initial number of water balloons to the additional ones gives:

\[9 + 15 = 24\]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding the donated boxes and the already owned boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}

"First, we calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spitted:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference in earnings is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 12-hour and the 24-hour options, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The base cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.
- Cameron will stay for 24 hours, which is exactly 24 hours, so there are no additional hours to pay for.

The cost for the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour option plus the additional hours:
- The base cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron will stay for 24 hours, which means he will stay for 12 hours plus 12 additional hours.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours is 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The cost difference is 1840 pesos - 1600 pesos = 240 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 240 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we subtract 3 pounds from this amount to find out how much each sheep needs:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = \text{Remaining after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:

\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = \text{Remaining after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Cost of one pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled out by Craig and his brother, we start by calculating the total number of letters Craig has spelled out.

Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the number of letters Craig spelled out to the number of letters his brother spelled out:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

First, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Fee**: $40
2. **Labor Cost**: $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as 0.25 of an hour is considered a full hour). Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we sum these amounts to get the total charge:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

So, Patty charged **$205**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original cost. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for the CDs after the discount:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"First, let's determine seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Sam had 70 loaves, so:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, which is 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. So we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 450 \]"

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"
"To find Leo's age, we can start by determining Marcus's age since we know Deanna's age and the relationship between Marcus and Deanna.

Given:
- Deanna's age = 26
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.

So, Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21.

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age = 2 * 21 = 42.

The final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has initially is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. The total number of utensils is:

\[ 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these 700 patients to the initial 200 occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after filling in the two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after filling in the two holes:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was:
\[ 10 \]

So, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 27 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Next, we sum up all the brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the ones eaten.

5. Total brownies initially:
   \[
   12 \text{ (made)} + 6 \text{ (office)} + 48 \text{ (friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. Brownies eaten during the party:
   \[
   18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

7. Brownies left over:
   \[
   66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, the total number of boxes given away is:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]

This means the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she kept. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she kept is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Mrs. Harrington sold the rest of the oranges. The total number of oranges she originally had is:
\[ 12 \times 20 = 240 \]

So, the number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 240 - 160 = 80 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 41 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy these items. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

\[ 41 - 14 = 27 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $27, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 27 \div 5 = 5.4 \]

Since Tyler can only work in whole hours, he needs to work 6 hours to earn at least $27. Therefore, the number of hours Tyler needs to work is:

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so the difference is:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the gingerbread and apple pie.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Price per box of gingerbread: $6
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Price per box of apple pie: $15
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we sum up the total earnings from both days.

**Total earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

The total amount Sunny earned for the two days is \(\boxed{465}\)."

"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E \), his dad's current age as \( D \), and his brother's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E = 19 \)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.

First, let's determine the age difference between Emil and his dad. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now (since \( 24 - 19 = 5 \)). At that time, his dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice the age of his brother. At that time, his brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be twice the age of his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads} \]

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:
\[ 20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90 \text{ beads} \]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the number of students who are not football players is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the 6 football players to these 6 students, we get the total number of students who need to leave early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie wears size 25 boots.

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many, we calculate:
\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel intake} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, we calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 63 \]"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plants in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost per basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Katherine has 5 baskets, so we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, we need to determine the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used by the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used by the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations combined:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil available for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so with $500.00 saved each month, the number of pairs she can buy each month is:

\[ \text{Pairs per month} = \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Pairs per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time to peel 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sautéing are independent, the total time required is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling on low: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling on high: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the total cooling and the total warming to find the net change in temperature:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).

Net change in temperature:
\[ 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\]

Since the net change is a cooling effect, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the Comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the time interval between Bill's first and second sightings of the Comet:
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years (since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years).

Now, we calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
- Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: He writes a check for the gas bill once per month, which also totals 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: He writes a check to the church twice per month, which totals 24 church checks per year (12 months * 2 checks per month).
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: He writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) for pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:

- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam spent $30 on new trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

So, Adam had to contribute \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars from his savings.

"To find Wilfred's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the average age of the group:**
   The total age of the children is 20. Since there are 4 children, the average age is:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Express Helene's age in terms of the average age:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:
   \[
   \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Set up an equation for the total age of the group:**
   The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, and we have Helene's age. Let Wilfred's age be \( W \). The equation for the total age is:
   \[
   3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
   \]

4. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   17 + W = 20
   \]
   Subtract 17 from both sides:
   \[
   W = 20 - 17 = 3
   \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

The total amount collected from these sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. Walter's friend will contribute $200.

Now, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, we need to calculate the total amount collected from everyone else (neighbors and online fund) and then multiply by 3.

The total amount collected from everyone else is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

The lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer will contribute:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the proportion of the watermelon that each adult and each child gets, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

If we let the volume of each child's slice be \( x \), then the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all the slices:

\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume of the watermelon \( V \) is equal to \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the watermelon each adult gets. Since there are 2 adults and each adult's slice is \( 2x \), the total volume of the slices for the adults is:

\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is therefore:

\[ \frac{4x}{8x} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and there are 9 inpatients, so:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatients from minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

We also need to convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatients and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. She wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ \boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}} \]"

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, along with the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Weeks in a Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of sessions in a month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.
6. **Total Earnings in a Month**: The total earnings in a month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions in a month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$480**."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

Substituting the volume in cubic feet:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of gallons:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = G \times 0.10 \]

Substituting the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"

   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after the next 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This means the initial charge \( C \) must be:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.3} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits he has already bought, he has:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Albums**: She divided these pictures into 8 albums.
3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 albums were for selfies only.
   - 2 albums were for portraits only.
   - The remaining albums were for other categories.

First, calculate the number of albums that were not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Next, we know that the 3 albums for other categories were equally distributed among selfies and portraits. Since there are 3 albums for other categories, and they are split equally between selfies and portraits:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ other albums}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ selfies albums} \]
\[ \frac{3 \text{ other albums}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ portraits albums} \]

However, since the number of albums must be whole numbers, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's assume the problem meant to imply that the 3 other albums were split into 1.5 each, which is not practical in real albums. Instead, let's assume the problem meant to imply that the 3 albums for other categories were split into 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1) for selfies and portraits.

Let's assume the correct split is 1 album for selfies and 2 albums for portraits (or vice versa):
\[ 1 \text{ album for selfies} \]
\[ 2 \text{ albums for portraits} \]

Now, calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
- Number of selfies:
\[ 1 \text{ album for selfies} \times 8 \text{ pictures per album} = 8 \text{ selfies} \]
- Number of portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums for portraits} \times 8 \text{ pictures per album} = 16 \text{ portraits} \]

Finally, add the number of selfies and portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ selfies} + 16 \text{ portraits} = 24 \text{ portraits and selfies} \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages he reads:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests checked in.
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial guests: 100
- Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- Guests after the afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- Guests after the additional check-ins: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Thus, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final numerical answer is:

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the quiz into its different question categories and calculate the number of questions she is sure to answer correctly in each category.

1. **Easy Questions:**
   - Total questions: 60
   - Percentage of easy questions: 40%
   - Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - Number of easy questions she is sure to get correct: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)

2. **Average Questions:**
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions.
   - Number of average questions: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions is half of the remaining questions.
   - Number of average questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
   - Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
   - Number of average questions she is sure to get correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

3. **Difficult Questions:**
   - Number of difficult questions: \( 18 \)
   - Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Number of difficult questions she is sure to get correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

Now, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

Thus, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is given as $4. Since large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, the total earnings can be expressed as:

\[ 12L + 4S = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 12L + 4(2L) = 120 \]
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the family eats a total of 77 sandwiches in one week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \]

Next, we know that out of the 100 eggs, 10 eggs were not found by the Smith twins. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs minus the eggs found by the twins and the 10 eggs that were not found by anyone:

\[ 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the number of eggs found by the friends is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.

**Step 1: Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.**

- A dwarf with a bare hand mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
- A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines twice as much as a dwarf with a bare hand, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.**

- One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.
- Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

**Step 3: Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.**

- There are 30 days in a month.
- So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore in a month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}
\]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost of the sandwiches is directly proportional to the number of sandwiches in the package.

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches. We know that the cost per sandwich is $1.5, so for 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue added)} = 35 \text{ balloons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 35 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.80

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 80% or 0.80

Total probability of having to turn in homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.80 = 1.30 \]

However, this total probability exceeds 100%, which indicates an overlap in the scenarios. We need to account for the overlap where the normal teacher gives an extension (40%) and Marcus convinces the teacher (20%). The overlap is:
\[ 0.40 \times 0.20 = 0.08 \]

So, the adjusted probability of having to turn in homework is:
\[ 0.50 + 0.80 - 0.08 = 1.22 \]

To find the percentage:
\[ 1.22 \times 100 = 122\% \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to re-evaluate the overlap correctly. The correct approach is to consider the complementary probability of not having to turn in homework and subtract from 100%.

Probability of not having to turn in homework:
\[ 0.50 + (0.60 \times 0.80) = 0.50 + 0.48 = 0.98 \]

Thus, the probability of having to turn in homework:
\[ 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 \]

Converting to percentage:
\[ 0.02 \times 100 = 2\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{2\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of available seats is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at $16 each:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 66 \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go to each of the 8 bottles and drop the candy at each one, he will need to go to 8 bottles.

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy at each bottle, the total time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"To determine the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
2. Determine how many packs can be made from the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples. Since Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 apples each can be made from 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18
\]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese Amor buys.

\[
\text{Total cost of cheese} = \$22 + \$18 = \$40
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money.

\[
\text{Money left} = \$50 - \$40 = \$10
\]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he received $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years, which totals:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total amount of money Jim borrowed is $200,000, and the total amount of money he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The difference between these two amounts is the total cost of his education in terms of lost income:

\[ \$200,000 - \$100,000 = \$100,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn back the $100,000 he spent on his education. Since his new income after college is $75,000 per year, the number of years required to earn back the $100,000 is:

\[ \frac{\$100,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = \frac{100,000}{75,000} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 1.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1.33 \text{ years} \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
   - Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
   - Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

2. Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
   - Area = Length × Width = \(8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\)

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
   - Total area = \(80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet}\)

Therefore, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.**

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.

First, calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
\[
\frac{425}{5} = 85
\]

Then, add 17 to this amount:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then, add 5 to this amount:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.**

Add the number of letters delivered on each day:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{736}

"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then sum them up.

For the chicken salad:
- Number of people: 10
- Cost per person: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 * $6.50 = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for both salads:
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to this, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars. Therefore, he did not lose any money in the second race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, we sum up the losses:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won $11)
- Third race: $16.5

Total loss = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now, let's calculate the total population:

Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.**

There are 3 weeks of work, and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.**

Each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. So, the total number of hours worked by all painters in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.**

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \div 4 = \frac{63}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours} \]

To convert \( \frac{63}{32} \) hours into a decimal:
\[ \frac{63}{32} = 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours each painter put in is:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the price of the car at the end of each year from 2007 to 2010.

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9830.18."
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

So, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}

   \]
3. **Second stop:** 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \text{ people}
   \]
4. **Third stop:** 80 more people disembark.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110 \text{ people}

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400
\]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- The increase is 60% of $120.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the increased monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays in a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is:
156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   Jill and her friends watch 4 movies on Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all the cats.
2. Determine how many days the total amount of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much cat food the cats consume in one day. Since each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

With 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following charges:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost for the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum up all these costs:

\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

This means that the number of emails James responds to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these 40 pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, we add the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left.

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the small and big coupons to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means that the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. The total number of meatball sub sandwiches now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks.

First, we know that Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks that failed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]
This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \) of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under the promotion:
- For the first 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the next 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the last 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.

The cost per pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost for each 2-pound segment is:
- \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to purchase 3 segments of 2 pounds each:
- Total cost = \( 3 \times \$8.00 = \$24.00 \)

Thus, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the movie theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. 

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The additional cost for these 21 guests is:

- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the additional cost:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas eaten by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens of roses Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen but less than two dozens, we can calculate the cost as follows:
\[ 14 \text{ roses} = 1 \text{ dozen} \]
\[ 1 \text{ dozen} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 1 \text{ rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 15 \text{ roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $18.75. Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The change she should receive is:
\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:
\[ 6.25 \div 0.25 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."

"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance from home to halfway point: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the first segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance from halfway point back to home: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the second segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for the first segment + Time for the second segment

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is:
\[ \frac{\$0.80}{4 \text{ bananas}} = \$0.20 \text{ per banana} \]

So, the total cost if she buys the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.20 \text{ per banana} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

The cost of each bunch is $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches. Therefore, the total cost if she buys the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
\[ \$8.00 - \$30.00 = -\$22.00 \]

Since the question asks how much money Jenny saved, and the result is negative, it indicates she actually spent more. Therefore, she did not save any money, but rather spent $22 more.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

The total amount of fence between them is 100 feet, so we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the growth over 13 years at this rate. We multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from selling these bags.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. Therefore, the number of bags sold is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. Therefore, the total earnings are:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, and it is given that this amount is 270 kilograms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Number of shaken sodas left: 2
   - Total number of sodas left: 4
   - Probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda: \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)
   - \(0.5 \times 100\% = 50\%\)

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at a speed of half of 60 miles per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{270}

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest slide: 60 feet/minute

\[
\text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length of the biggest slide}}{\text{Speed of the biggest slide}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest slide: 80 feet/minute

\[
\text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length of the second biggest slide}}{\text{Speed of the second biggest slide}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time for the biggest slide} - \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

   \text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   Since she plans to save for 20 years, the total amount needed for retirement is:
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   Lauren saves \$20,000 per year.
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for her retirement plan.

"To determine the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts is 5 cm long.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Since 40% of the total students are boys, we can write:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

1. Amalia's chore was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's time is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]
   (Note: ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 4 hours, but since the exact amount is not specified, we assume the minimum ""well over"" is 8 hours for a clear calculation.)

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah as:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \), and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 2A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs, so:

"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik will have 25 groups of crayons. Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box will weigh 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to get the total weight in ounces:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Since she walks at a certain speed on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. So her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent walking by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks.

\[
4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars}

\[
60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save $28.

\[
\frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}
\]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the current number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 of them is 26.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After this, he can drink the water, which means the temperature of the water in his water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the second mug has a temperature \( T \) degrees. After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the second mug will be \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce out of 5 ounces is poured).

The total temperature of the water in his water bottle will be the weighted average of the temperatures from the two mugs:
\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times \frac{T}{5}}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + \frac{T}{5}}{5} = \frac{132}{5} + \frac{T}{25} = 26.4 + \frac{T}{25} \]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ 26.4 + \frac{T}{25} \geq 40 \]
\[ \frac{T}{25} \geq 40 - 26.4 \]
\[ \frac{T}{25} \geq 13.6 \]
\[ T \geq 13.6 \times 25 \]
\[ T \geq 340 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 340 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{340} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added:
\[ 50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ cows added} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ 20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we find the total number of animals:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Russell orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we need to follow these steps:

Given:
- The number of green jellybeans is 17.
- The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans.
- The total number of jellybeans is 60.

First, calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
\]

Next, calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[
\text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = \text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51
\]

Now, subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total number of jellybeans} - \text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first find out how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the problem, we know:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Next, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from sunflowers and the sunflowers sold from bouquets:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ \boxed{291} \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first understand the probabilities associated with each ticket.

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket being a winner. This is because the events are independent.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."

"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles per person (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many of the babies wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

\[ 200 \text{ apartments} + 200 \text{ apartments} = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} + 640 \text{ apartments} = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment in each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections} \times \$0.40 \text{ per collection} = \$1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1248 \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Determine how much money Rissa was given.
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - Rissa's original amount was $15, so after giving \(x\) dollars, she is left with \(15 - x\).
   - According to the problem, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).
   - Simplify the right side: \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\).
   - So, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\). Therefore, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

3. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left.
   - Ronnie originally had $5.
   - After giving $3 to their little sister, Ronnie is left with \(5 - 3 = 2\) dollars.

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural. Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms:
\[ \text{Total area of the bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the total area of the house is the sum of the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house. The remaining area is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of the bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box of dishwasher pods, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12.
   - The new box contains 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many cycles can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles that can be run with $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team in the match:
- **Team A:**
  - First half: 4 goals
  - Second half: 2 goals
  - Total for Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals

- **Team B:**
  - First half: 2 goals
  - Second half: 8 goals
  - Total for Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity.

The total number of students not on varsity is the total number of students minus the number of students on varsity. The total number of students is:

"To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin is indeed 20 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per dollar:

\[ \text{Number of books per dollar} = \frac{100 \text{ books}}{500 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{1 \text{ book}}{5 \text{ dollars}} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \times \frac{1 \text{ book}}{5 \text{ dollars}} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Bob distributes the $27,000 among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the number of apples Newton brought home step by step.

1. **Initial apples**: Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First apple on head**: One apple landed on Newton's head.
   - Apples on the ground: 1

3. **Newton's actions**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples (1 on head + 1 on the ground).
   - He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - This action caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 5

4. **Newton's second actions**:
   - Newton picked up the 5 apples that fell out.
   - He put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - This action caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 6

5. **Newton's final actions**:
   - Newton picked up all 6 apples that fell out.
   - He put all of them in his pocket.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton brought home:
- Apples in his pocket: 1 (from the first apple on head) + 1 (put in pocket) + 1 (put in pocket) + 1 (put in pocket) + 1 (put in pocket) + 6 (final apples) = 10 apples.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[
\boxed{306}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the cheese pizza = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the pepperoni pizza = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Next, we determine how many whole pizzas are needed for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas and both types require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces.
2. Doxa ate 1 slice.
3. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
4. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**Day 1:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- So, at the end of Day 1, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

**Day 2:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than on Day 1, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- So, at the end of Day 2, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

**Day 3:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a bulk pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- So, at the end of Day 3, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\) bandages.

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered:

- They used 28 bandages on Day 2.
- They ordered 100 bandages on Day 3, but only used 25 of them.
- So, at the end of Day 3, they had \(22 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 79\) bandages.

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the problem statement or a need to recheck the initial conditions. However, based on the given conditions and the logical steps, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost for the color is $40.

Adding the cost of the haircut and the color, we get $60 + $40 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost for May's haircut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly regular pay is:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} \]

\[ = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} \]

\[ = \$67.50 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total regular pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

\[ = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for each week she has complete attendance. Since she had complete attendance for all 4 weeks, her total attendance bonus for April is:
\[ \$10 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

\[ = \$40.00 \]

Adding her regular pay and the attendance bonus together gives her total earnings for April:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 \]

\[ = \$310.00 \]

So, Jen will receive a total of \$310.00 in April."
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount of money he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the total for this task is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
2. For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the total for this task is \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
3. For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the total for this task is \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
4. For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the total for this task is \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum the amounts earned from each task:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information given, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice this number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum all these numbers to get the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of trees planted on the first day.**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the first day is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of trees planted on the second day.**
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) more Lodgepole Pine trees were planted on the second day. Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the second day is \(30 + 50 = 80\).

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days.**
- The total number of trees planted on the first day is 60.
- The total number of trees planted on the second day is 80.

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99

   - Water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed over all settings:
- Total water removed = Water removed on low setting + Water removed on medium setting + Water removed on high setting
- Total water removed = 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November is $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours he travels is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Given his average speed is 50 km/hr, the total distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

   - Gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) per week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly cost for cheese is \(3.00 + 6.00 = 9.00\).

3. **Total weekly cost:**
   - The total weekly cost for making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the cost of pasta and cheese.
   - Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

4. **Total yearly cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total yearly cost is \(10.00 \times 52 = 520.00\).

Thus, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is \(\boxed{520.00}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the interpretation. The custodian works 8 hours a day, and they need 20 hours to clean all classrooms. This means they would need to work more than one day to complete the task. But since the question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we should consider the time spent cleaning relative to the 8-hour workday.

The correct interpretation is that the custodian spends 250% of their 8-hour workday cleaning, which is not practically possible in a single day. However, the question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, which is:

\[ \boxed{250\%} \]

This indicates that the custodian would need to work more than one day to complete the task, but the question specifically asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, which is 250%."
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf and then the total capacity of the bookcases.

1. **Middle shelves:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves.
   - Total capacity of the middle shelves: \( 10 \text{ books/shelf} \times 2 \text{ shelves} = 20 \text{ books} \).

2. **Bottom shelf:**
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Capacity of the bottom shelf: \( 2 \times 10 \text{ books} = 20 \text{ books} \).

3. **Top shelf:**
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Capacity of the top shelf: \( 20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books} \).

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Total capacity of one bookcase: \( 20 \text{ books (middle)} + 20 \text{ books (bottom)} + 15 \text{ books (top)} = 55 \text{ books} \).

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - Number of bookcases required: \( \frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books/bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases} \).

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the original price of the beef jerky bag and the discounted price.

The original price of the bag is $18.00.

Since the bag is $3.00 off, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks.

To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price of the bag by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct. So, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. This can be written as:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 96 \]"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that one. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to ensure he meets or exceeds the 15 car sales goal).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room. Since there are 8 rooms, there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms (which is 4 rooms) have 4 small candles each. So, the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the rooms (which is also 4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each. So, the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Number of Candles and Flashlights:**
   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of the flashlights and the candles.
   - This is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to find out how many robots, helmets, and footballs are present in the changing room. We know the following:

1. There are 20 helmets.
2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets.
3. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs.

First, let's find the number of robots. Since the number of robots is half the number of helmets:
\[
\text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, let's find the number of footballs. Since the number of helmets is half the number of footballs:
\[
\text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. The total distance is 200 yards, with half of the distance being 100 yards on land and the other half being 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. The speed on land is 20 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{hop}} \) to hop 100 yards is given by:
\[
t_{\text{hop}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. The speed in water is 10 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{swim}} \) to swim 100 yards is given by:
\[
t_{\text{swim}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time \( t_{\text{total}} \) for the entire journey is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{hop}} + t_{\text{swim}} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- The total weekly consumption is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
   \[
   10 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ legs/animal} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   \[
   15 \text{ animals} \times 4 \text{ legs/animal} = 60 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   \[
   20 \text{ legs} + 60 \text{ legs} = 80 \text{ legs}
   \]

4. Convert the total number of legs to pairs of legs by dividing by 2:
   \[

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the number of blue and yellow blocks in the tower.

Given:
- The tower has 4 blue blocks.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks.

Let's calculate the number of yellow blocks:
\[ \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we know the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. We can now set up an equation to find the number of red blocks. Let \( R \) represent the number of red blocks.

The total number of blocks is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ \text{Total blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} \]
\[ 32 = 4 + 8 + R \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 32 = 12 + R \]
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, find the net distance from his starting point:
- The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the new value after the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, again applied to the new value after the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To determine the number of pink candies, we first need to calculate the number of orange and yellow candies based on the given information.

1. The number of red candies is given as 54.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. Therefore, the number of pink candies is:
\[
\text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Since there are five pigs, the total feed consumption per day is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption in a week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total original price for 2 T-shirts is \(2 \times 8 = $16\).
- The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means for every T-shirt Jake buys, he gets another one at 50% off. So, for 2 T-shirts, he gets the first one at full price and the second one at 50% off.
- The first T-shirt costs $8.
- The second T-shirt costs \(8 \times 0.5 = $4\).
- Therefore, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = $12\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is \(40 \times 0.40 = $16\).
- The price of the shoes after the discount is \(40 - 16 = $24\).

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:
- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36.

"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance from doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left for the movie tickets:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide $13 by $6.50:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, the number of movie tickets he can buy is:

"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:

   32 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
   \[
   95 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   \[
   120 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.
   \[
   750 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[
8 \text{ dollars} + 9.50 \text{ dollars} + 6.00 \text{ dollars} + 7.50 \text{ dollars} = 31.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the jar is:
\[
\boxed{31.00}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:

\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the $40:

\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day and is open 5 days a week, the number of cars he services in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers. Therefore, each part of his collection consists of:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \]

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half of the collection and $7 per toy for the second half. So, we calculate the earnings from each part as follows:

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both parts gives the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.

Total holes dug by the dog:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over time when Nate returns:
- Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day.
- The dog digs 6 holes per night.

Net holes filled per day:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor correctly gathered the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items placed on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket.

1. The first basket contains 10 eggs.
2. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700

Adding these amounts together:
\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by all of them is:
\[
\boxed{2180}

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:
\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times \text{Time Aaron took} = A \times 16 \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute and he took 16 minutes, we have:
\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Since Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, the total distance they ran together is the sum of the distances each ran. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \) and the distance Vanessa ran as \( D_V \). We know:
\[ D_A + D_V = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we have:
\[ D_V = 4 \]

So, the total distance of the race is:
\[ D_A + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Since \( D_A = A \times 16 \), we substitute \( D_A \) in the equation:
\[ A \times 16 + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Now, we need to find the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute, and she ran 4 miles. The time \( T_V \) Vanessa took to complete her part is:
\[ T_V = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Speed of Vanessa}} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We know \( A = 2V \), so:
\[ V = \frac{A}{2} \]

Substituting \( V = \frac{A}{2} \) into the time equation for Vanessa:
\[ T_V = \frac{4}{\frac{A}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{A} = \frac{8}{A} \]

Since \( A = 2V \), we substitute \( A \) back:
\[ T_V = \frac{8}{2V} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We need to find \( V \). From the total distance equation:
\[ A \times 16 + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Since \( A = 2V \):
\[ 2V \times 16 + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]
\[ 32V + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

We know \( D_V = 4 \) miles, so:
\[ 32V + 4 = 32V + 4 \]

This confirms our setup. Now, we need to find \( V \). Since \( A = 2V \) and \( A \times 16 = 32V \):
\[ 32V + 4 = 32V + 4 \]

Thus, \( V = 1 \) mile per minute. Therefore:
\[ T_V = \frac{4}{V} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 4 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He currently has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to buy} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line he already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 594 \]"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of reservations per night:**
   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.

2. **Determine the number of reservations per day:**
   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   Multiply the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine James's current age. We know that Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old. Since James is now twice as old as Dora, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to determine how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( h \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

Now that we know \( h = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
