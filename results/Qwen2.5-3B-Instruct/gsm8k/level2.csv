"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating three for breakfast and using four for baking muffins.

Total eggs laid per day: 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Eggs used for muffins: 4

Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Eggs remaining for sale: 16 - 7 = 9

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

Total earnings per day: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

So, the final numerical answer is $18."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. Identify the amount of white fiber needed: The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.
3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber: Add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together. This gives us \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) bolts.

So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh then puts in $50,000 in repairs, and this increases the value of the house by 150%.

The increase in value is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of the repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total meters run per sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters per sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters run per day:**
   James runs 3 sprints each day, so the total meters run per day is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/day} = 180 \text{ meters/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters run per week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total meters run per week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of every second glass:
- The cost of every second glass is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses are at the discounted price and how many are at the full price. Since every second glass is discounted, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of discounted glasses:
- Number of discounted glasses = \(16 / 2 = 8\).

Now, we calculate the total cost for the discounted glasses:
- Total cost for discounted glasses = \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

We also need to calculate the cost for the remaining glasses, which are at the full price:
- Number of full-price glasses = \(16 - 8 = 8\).
- Total cost for full-price glasses = \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs of the discounted and full-price glasses to get the total cost:
- Total cost = \(24 + 40 = 64\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by determining the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate, which is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to get her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} \times 68 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 204 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dozen} \times 80 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 160 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     6 \text{ dozen} \times 55 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 330 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} + 330 \text{ dollars} = 694 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost is:
\[
\boxed{694}

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = 10.5 - 93 = -82.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the net profit is negative each year, Carlos will not start earning money from the lemon tree until the initial investment is recovered. The initial investment is $90, and since the net profit is $-82.5 per year, it will take:
\[ \frac{90}{82.5} \approx 1.0909 \text{ years} \]

Since Carlos cannot have a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take 2 years before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{2x}{6} + 1 = \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{4x}{6} - \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   We know that after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. **Contemporary Dance Enrollment:**
   - 20% of 20 students = \(0.20 \times 20 = 4\) students.

2. **Remaining Students After Contemporary Dance:**
   - Total students - Students in contemporary dance = \(20 - 4 = 16\) students.

3. **Jazz Dance Enrollment:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = \(0.25 \times 16 = 4\) students.

4. **Remaining Students After Jazz Dance:**
   - Remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance = \(16 - 4 = 12\) students.

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that this represents, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To determine the profit the merchant would make by choosing either the jewelry or the electronic gadgets, we need to calculate the future value of each purchase based on the given market growth rates and then compare the difference between the two.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - The desired average speed is 4 miles per hour.
   - The total distance is 12 miles.
   - The total time \( T \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     T = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   - Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles.
   - She has also spent another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles.
   - Total time spent so far: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired: 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
  \]

Now, we add the amounts of water from both drinks:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Raymond's age when he had his son and then find out how many years ago that was.

1. Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:
   - Raymond had a son at the age of 23.

2. Determine Samantha's current age:
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.

3. Calculate the age difference between Raymond and Samantha:
   - Age difference = Samantha's age - Raymond's age when he had his son
   - Age difference = 31 - 23 = 8 years

4. Since Raymond was 6 years younger than Samantha when he had his son, we can confirm that Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son, and Samantha was 27 years old at that time (31 - 6 = 25, but we use the age difference for consistency).

5. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born:
   - Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns and then use the rate of melting to find the total length lost.

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total length lost:
   - Since the candle melts 2 centimeters per hour and it burns for 4 hours, the total length lost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}
     \]

Thus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

\[
\boxed{253}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \). So, the second friend's guess is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \( \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20 \). So, the third friend's guess is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
80

   - Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"

"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each of the two 20-minute segments and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both segments:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after the purchase.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can verify that the remaining $5 is indeed the difference between the money he made from selling the lego sets and the cost of the video games.

Finally, we need to find out how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find John's running speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. So, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we know the time he spends running each day. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on the second and third days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we can find his running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John's running speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that Dana's walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances traveled by running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of the bag of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50g (because 300g / 5 servings = 60g/serving), the amount of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams of chips} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams/serving} = 40 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making 20 candles. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

First, we know that Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \). After purchasing the package, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the package was \( 80 + x \).

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we add 140 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[ \text{Total number of units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

3/4 of the building is occupied.
\[ \text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

\[ \text{Number of unoccupied units} = \text{Total number of units} - \text{Number of occupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 1764 \, \text{eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

\[ \text{Dozens per week} = \frac{1764 \, \text{eggs/week}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 147 \, \text{dozen/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen.

\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = 147 \, \text{dozen/week} \times 2 \, \text{\$/dozen} = 294 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know the distance he traveled to get to his destination and the rate at which he travels back.

First, let's determine the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Since the problem doesn't specify the distance, we'll assume the distance to his destination is \(D\) miles. Given that he travels at 10 miles per hour for 2 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 10 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to travel back the 20 miles is given by the formula:
\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time it takes him to get back is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday, we need to calculate the total charges for each day separately.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each charged at $60.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each charged at $40.

First, calculate the revenue from truck tires:
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360 \]

Next, calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160 \]

Now, add the revenues from both types of tires to find the total revenue for Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each charged at $40.

Calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480 \]

Since the mechanic does not repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0.

Now, add the revenue from car tires to find the total revenue for Friday:
\[ \$0 + \$480 = \$480 \]

**Comparison of Revenue:**
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Thus, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total weight limit of the bridge:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight limit} = 5000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Identify the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of driver and empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the weight of each box:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of each box} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \right\rfloor
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

7. **Since the result is an integer, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:**
   \[
   \boxed{83}
   \]

To ensure the solution is correct, we can verify:
- The weight of 83 boxes is \( 83 \times 15 = 1245 \) pounds.
- The total weight of the truck with 83 boxes and the driver and empty truck is \( 1245 + 3755 = 5000 \) pounds, which is exactly the weight limit.

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is indeed \(\boxed{83}\)."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

First, we start with the original bill amount:
\[ \text{Original bill} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we add the 25% delivery fee to the original bill. To calculate the 25% fee:
\[ \text{25% of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

Adding this fee to the original bill:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee} = \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee and delivery charge} = \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ \text{Final bill} = \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:
\[ \boxed{57.00} \]"

"To find out how many oranges are good, we need to first determine the total number of oranges and then subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Given:
- Total oranges = 25
- Bad oranges = 1
- Unripe oranges = 20% of total oranges
- Sour oranges = 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ \text{Unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, we know the total number of oranges that are either bad, unripe, or sour:
\[ \text{Total bad, unripe, or sour oranges} = \text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

Finally, subtract the number of bad, unripe, or sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[ \text{Good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total bad, unripe, or sour oranges} = 25 - 8 = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. So, the total cost before insurance is:

Next, Janet pays 10% of the total cost for insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1430 \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the next 10 years at the 5% rate. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge is:
     \[
     140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the year:**
   - Add the costs of the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how many gallons of gas are left in the tank after she has driven 100 miles. Since she needed 4 gallons to refill the tank, the amount of gas left in the tank is:

\[ 12 \text{ gallons} - 4 \text{ gallons} = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we know that 4 gallons of gas allow her to drive 100 miles. Therefore, we can calculate how many miles she can drive with 1 gallon of gas:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With a full tank of 12 gallons, the total distance she can drive is:

\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate the total amount of money she received from her weekly allowance and then subtract this from her total amount of money at the end of 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount of money she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the $40 she received from her allowance. Let's denote the amount of money she started with as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level (level 4) as \( S_4 \), the level below it (level 3) as \( S_3 \), the level below that (level 2) as \( S_2 \), and the bottom level (level 1) as \( S_1 \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ S_4 = 16 \]

Since each level below has half the square footage of the level above it:
\[ S_3 = \frac{S_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ S_2 = \frac{S_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ S_1 = \frac{S_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 4 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 8 \)
- Level 4: \( S_4 = 16 \)

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{4} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food needed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use, we divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost (\( L = 7 \)), we can find the number of games they won (\( W \)):
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has been on and then recognize that each vacation corresponds to one quilt block.

First, we find out how many years Gene has been vacationing. He is now 34 years old and he started vacationing when he was 23 years old. Therefore, the number of years he has been vacationing is:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Since Gene has one shirt (quilt block) from each vacation, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the number of years he has been vacationing. Thus, the total number of quilt blocks is:
\[ 11 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and then sum them up.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Therefore, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from each instance:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**: 
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

6. **Salary Increase for the Third Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8000} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both adults and children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we can find the total number of pets by summing the pets each person has:
\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the ages of the kids.

Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( H \)

From the problem, we know:
1. James is 10 years old: \( H = 10 \)
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( H = C - 1 \)
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)

First, we can substitute the value of \( H \) into the second equation to find Corey's age:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now we know Corey is 11 years old. Next, we use the fourth equation to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Now we know Amy is 9 years old. We can use the first equation to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Use the information about Gerald's improved speed to find his new time.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we are told that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his new diet. This means that Gerald's new time to run the 400-meter hurdles is 10% less than his original time. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's new time is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Let's denote the number of dogs as \(D\), the number of cats as \(C\), and the number of rabbits as \(R\).

Given:
- The number of dogs \(D = 60\).
- The number of cats \(C = 2D\).
- The number of rabbits \(R\) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, express the number of rabbits \(R\) in terms of the number of dogs and cats:
\[ R = (D + C) - 12 \]
Substitute the values of \(D\) and \(C\):
\[ R = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[ \text{Total pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[ \boxed{348} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - The sauce loses half its volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Calculation: \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \).

2. **Convert the volume of tomatoes to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are equivalent to 64 ounces, we divide 64 by 16.
   - Calculation: \( 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \).

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam ended. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the potted plants she will give away. Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving away 40 plants, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings each friend pressed and then sum them up.

First, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Let's denote the number of times the fourth friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_4 \). So, \( F_4 = 60 \).

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Let's denote the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_3 \). Therefore, \( F_3 = F_4 + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 \).

The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_1 \). So, \( F_1 = 20 \). The second friend pressed the doorbell \( F_1 + \frac{1}{4}F_1 = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \).

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so \( F_1 = 20 \).

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:
\[ F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + F_4 = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175. \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 4 \text{ glasses} = 24 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. The city is 42 miles across. We need to find out how many minutes it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we will multiply the volume of one box by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of the box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 such boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on other days.

Here's the breakdown of the hours he watched TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these up:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours he watched from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

This 1 hour of TV he watched on Wednesday must be the 30-minute episode. Therefore, Frankie watched 1 episode of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry intended to bake (and which is also the number of cookies he baked last year) is \( x = 50 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row 64 seconds. Since her speed is 1.25 feet per second, the distance she rows in 64 seconds is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water the boat takes on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks as \( D \).

According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

The problem also states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 50D \]

Since we already know \( B = 300 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, we need to determine the selling price of the lumber. Since the question does not specify the selling price, we assume she sells them at the same cost price. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is also $180.

The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the total amount used is the sum of the teaspoons of sugar and the cups of water, which is given as 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now that we have \(x = 6\), we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is \(7x\):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

\[\boxed{42}\]"

   - Total cost = \(6 \times 60 = 360\)

So, John paid \(\boxed{360}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.**

There were 2 containers initially, each containing 5 vehicles.
\[
2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.**

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[
30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.**

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[
\frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
\]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down the problem day by day and then sum the hours.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours for each day of the week:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 7 \text{ (Friday)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

"First, let's calculate how far Rosie runs in the initial 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after the initial 3 hours:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

"To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped.
2. Determine the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started stamping.

First, Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

After stamping, the number of letters needing stamps is:
\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

We know that after Jennie finished stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 30 letters are the ones that were already stamped plus the 20 letters that Jennie stamped. Therefore, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   Given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - **Watermelons:**
     Dillon buys 4 watermelons.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Peppers:**
     Dillon buys 20 peppers.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
\[ \text{Total patient hours per day} = 500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these patient hours:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40,000/\text{day} \]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital from these patient hours:
\[ \text{Cost} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30,000/\text{day} \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$40,000/\text{day} - \$30,000/\text{day} = \$10,000/\text{day} \]

So, the hospital's profit from these visits is:

2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we sum up the total number of pieces from all three sets:

\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125.

\[
\boxed{2125}
\]"
"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   The number of bees returning is half the number that left in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave the hive as the number that left in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving in the next 6 hours is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Bee population after the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there are 0 bees in the hive. After 30 bees leave, the hive has:
   \[
   0 - 30 = -30 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Then, 15 bees return, so the hive has:
   \[
   -30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Finally, 60 bees leave, so the hive has:
   \[
   -15 - 60 = -75 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Since the number of bees cannot be negative, we assume the hive is empty after the first 12 hours (i.e., 0 bees).

5. **Bee population in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. The number of bees that left before is 30 (in the first 6 hours) + 60 (in the next 6 hours) = 90 bees. Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

The number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference in their times.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
\(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for bicycles = \(5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for tricycles = \(3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came on a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = \(1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire}\).

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. **Bicycles:**
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 = 250 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Tricycles:**
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 = 225 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Unicycle:**
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 1 \times 1 \times 25 = 25 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost in cents:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Finally, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. **Final number of fries**: 5
2. **Raccoon**: The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole them as \( x \). The raccoon stole \(\frac{2}{3}x\), so the remaining fries are \(\frac{1}{3}x = 5\). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 5 \times 3 = 15 \).
3. **Three pigeons**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \). Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 15 + 9 = 24 \) fries.
4. **Dave and the seagull**: Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. Before the seagull ate, there were \( 24 + 14 + 7 = 45 \) fries.
5. **Initial number of fries**: The initial number of fries in the pack is 45.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the lengths of the croissants and baguettes are given in inches, and the rolls are already in inches.

1. **Rolls**: 
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: 
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes**: 
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \text{ feet} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana consumption for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back).
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Next, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Use the depth on Tuesday to find the depth on Wednesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth is 7 feet more than on Monday:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase = 20% of the original price every 2 months

2. **Calculate the price increase every 2 months:**
   - Price increase per 2 months = \( 0.20 \times P_0 = 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \)

3. **Determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of 2-month periods in 36 months = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

4. **Calculate the total price increase over 36 months:**
   - Total price increase = \( 18 \times 4 = \$72 \)

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months:**
   - Final price \( P_{36} = P_0 + \text{Total price increase} = 20 + 72 = \$92 \)

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to determine the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of a red car:**
   - We know that one red car costs $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of one red car is $4.

2. **Cost of an action figure:**
   - We are given that an action figure costs $5.

3. **Cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures would cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys:
- The value of the red cars: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The value of the action figures: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The value of the doll: \(15\) dollars.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income:
- Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
- Therefore, the missed income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Since the missed income ($105) is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant ($90), Jackie will have less money if she hires the accountant. Specifically, she will have \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \) less.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Adding these together:

\[ 157 + 74 + 102 + 102 = 435 \]

Next, we add the cost of the computer itself, which is €1090:

\[ 1090 + 435 = 1525 \]

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

\[ 1500 - 1525 = -25 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Elvira does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the accessories. She will be short by €25.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then sum these costs.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. Therefore, the cost of the pants is:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The total cost of each uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
   \[

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15
     \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of Chinese participants.
2. Subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.

First, we know the total number of participants is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To find out how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will have left is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to find out how many crabs each of them has individually and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. We can denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). Therefore,
\[ B = 40. \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. We can denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore,
\[ M = B - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36. \]

Then, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. We can denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore,
\[ R = M + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46. \]

Now, we need to find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together. We can denote the total number of crabs as \( T \). Therefore,
\[ T = R + M + B = 46 + 36 + 40 = 122. \]

The total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the second piece of information:
\[
5w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
- Difference = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:
\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
\text{Percentage difference} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2}{1} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find out how many apples Jenna and her mother picked together, we start by determining how many apples Jenna picked. According to the problem, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Since her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples they picked together:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
30

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $100, the rate (R) is 2% or 0.02, and the time (T) is 3 months. Since the interest rate is given monthly, we can directly use the time in months.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 = 6 \]

Next, add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{106} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a cost of $20 per bag, so the total cost for the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The trader also incurs a transportation cost of $2 per bag, so the total transportation cost is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of the wheat and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells all \( n \) bags at a rate of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling the wheat is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the total cost of $102 is to be split evenly among the three friends, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid $34. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount of insects needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We do this by multiplying the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.**
Tom starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, the number of trees he would have if no trees died is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.**
After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.**
The number of trees left after 10 years is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Friday morning after the prank:**
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos remain.

4. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors put the 6 white flamingos back out:**
   - So, the total number of flamingos on Saturday morning is \( 12 \) pink flamingos + \( 6 \) white flamingos = \( 18 \) flamingos.

5. **On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - Total number of flamingos on Sunday morning is \( 18 \) pink flamingos + \( 18 \) pink flamingos = \( 36 \) flamingos.

6. **Number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - \( 36 \) flamingos in total - \( 6 \) white flamingos = \( 30 \) pink flamingos.

7. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - \( 6 \) white flamingos.

8. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - \( 30 \) pink flamingos - \( 6 \) white flamingos = \( 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know the rate at which Publisher A pays Mark. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese for the week and used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, we sum up all the cheese slices used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag:

\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag:

\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has by adding the green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens together:

\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]
So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let's call this score \( x \). The sum of all six test scores should be 558:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \text{ cakes}
\]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:
\[
\boxed{76}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \) dollars.
   - Twenty dozen cups is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 240x \) dollars.

3. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   240x = 34800
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{34800}{240}
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
   \]

Thus, the cost of each cup is \( \boxed{145} \) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:

\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara has already saved and how much more she needs to earn. Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn by \( x \). The total amount of money she earns from babysitting is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) dollars, and the total amount of money she earns from mowing the lawn is \( 4x \) dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money she has after mowing the lawn \( x \) times is:

\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70, so we set up the inequality:

\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 4x \geq 40 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amounts of water in the pools are related by the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
Rearranging terms to solve for \( S \):
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup and calculations. The correct interpretation should be that the small pool has \( S \) gallons and the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons. The leak rate affects the current amounts, but the relationship between the current amounts should still hold. Let's substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus an additional 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. Therefore, her remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Given that there are 4 roses and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

First, we know Harriet's current age is 21 years. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Next, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can find Adrian's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66
\]
\[
\text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45
\]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages in three years and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Let Jojo's score be \( J \). The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]
6. Solve for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount spent on advertising in the second year.
2. Add the amounts spent in the first and second years.

First, we know the company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year. For the second year, the company spent a third of that amount on advertising. So, we calculate the amount spent in the second year as follows:

\[
\text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Next, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total amount spent over the two years:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Total cards: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces to the puzzle and then determine the total time required.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add per minute together.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is:
\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Together, they can add:
\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and were taken home by Ashlyn. This means the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and were taken home by Ashlyn. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark then pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is \(25 \times 2 = 50\).

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we start by calculating how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36
2. **One-third jump into the ocean**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.
3. **Another one-third go into the cave**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Next, we calculate the total number of penguins that leave the snow to either swim or go to the cave:
\[
12 \text{ (jumping into the ocean)} + 12 \text{ (going into the cave)} = 24
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins to find out how many are still sunbathing:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve and his girlfriend together eat:

\[ \text{Total consumption per week} = (6 + 3) \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the problem, one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the weekly production of one vine:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many whole pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices:
\[
20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[
\frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens. Ram starts with 25 pens and can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. This means that for every five empty pens, he can create one new pen.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. After this, he will have 20 original pens and 1 new pen, making a total of 21 pens.
3. **Second Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 20 original pens) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 15 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, and 1 new pen from the second round, making a total of 17 pens.
4. **Third Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 15 original pens) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 10 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, 1 new pen from the second round, and 1 new pen from the third round, making a total of 13 pens.
5. **Fourth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 10 original pens) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 5 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, 1 new pen from the second round, 1 new pen from the third round, and 1 new pen from the fourth round, making a total of 9 pens.
6. **Fifth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 5 original pens) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 0 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, 1 new pen from the second round, 1 new pen from the third round, 1 new pen from the fourth round, and 1 new pen from the fifth round, making a total of 5 pens.
7. **Sixth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 5 original pens) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 0 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, 1 new pen from the second round, 1 new pen from the third round, 1 new pen from the fourth round, 1 new pen from the fifth round, and 1 new pen from the sixth round, making a total of 3 pens.
8. **Seventh Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 3 original pens) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 0 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, 1 new pen from the second round, 1 new pen from the third round, 1 new pen from the fourth round, 1 new pen from the fifth round, 1 new pen from the sixth round, and 1 new pen from the seventh round, making a total of 1 pen.
9. **Eighth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens (out of the 1 original pen) to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 0 original pens, 1 new pen from the first round, 1 new pen from the second round, 1 new pen from the third round, 1 new pen from the fourth round, 1 new pen from the fifth round, 1 new pen from the sixth round, 1 new pen from the seventh round, and 1 new pen from the eighth round, making a total of 1 pen.

At this point, he will have 0 original pens left, and he will have 8 new pens. Since he can't make any more new pens with the remaining 0 original pens, the total number of pens he has is the sum of the original pens and the new pens he made:

\[ 25 + 8 = 33 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{33}\)."

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each individual based on the information given.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Adding these together:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
4. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit B, which will be the number of students who went out through exit C.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of the total number of students.
   \[
   \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. The number of students who went out through exit B is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students.
   \[
   \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students remaining after exit B is the number of students who went out through exit C.
   \[
   \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. We are given that John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2R = 54
\]

To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
\[
R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[
54 - 33 = 21
\]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
\[3 \text{ (Dolly's books)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's books)} = 6 \text{ books}\]

Thus, the total number of books they collectively read by the end is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, the number of pen pals he has left is:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pages per week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ pages per week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages per week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ pages per week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:
\[ 60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses in a month:
- Jason has a daily call of 15 minutes with his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

\[
15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the extra minutes he used this month:
- Jason used an additional 300 minutes.

\[
450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, subtract the total minutes used from the plan's total minutes:
- Jason's phone plan allows 1000 minutes per month.

\[
1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[
\boxed{250}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, after all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\), we get:
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[
32 - 4 = 28
\]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[
28 = 2 \times (2f)
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
28 = 4f
\]

Solve for \( f \):
\[
f = \frac{28}{4} = 7
\]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires makeup done 4 times a week for 6 hours each time, and the movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 4 times/week * 6 hours/day * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means she pays 90% of the total cost.

Discounted cost = $30,000 * 0.90 = $27,000

So, the final numerical answer is $27,000."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate on each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, on Monday, Sue ate:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, on Tuesday, Sue ate:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue are:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

And the total calories consumed by her sister are:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the total calories her sister consumed from the total calories Sue consumed:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school and then find out how many of them are boys and girls.

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

The second class has 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we need to find out how many boys are in the third class. Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, and we already know the number of boys in the first and second classes, we can calculate the number of boys in the third class as follows:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night = 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so he killed \( 3c \) wolves.
   - It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars today.
   - Therefore, \( c = 12 \).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Total animals killed last night = 25.
   - Total animals killed today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.
   - Total animals killed = 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he now has is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally into the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any wood is eaten by termites. The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tree is:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the entire tree is:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to account for the fact that termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. This means that 70% of the tree's weight remains. We calculate 70% of the total weight:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ A_a = 52 \]

From this, we can solve for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:

\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:

\[ A_{total} = A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

And the total number of fruits Jamal has:

\[ J_{total} = J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ Total_{fruits} = A_{total} + J_{total} = 76 + 92 = 168 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the 9,300 pennies.

The number of pennies in two thirds of the cup is:

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees:

\[ \text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:

\[ \boxed{118000} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:**
   \[
   \text{Time to heat to 300 degrees} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees compared to 300 degrees.
   - First, calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this to the original 20 minutes:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Calculate the cooking time:
     \[
     28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken:**
   - Add the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the cooking time:
     \[
     20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[
\boxed{71}

"To find the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 5 \, \text{dollars/ad} \times 50 \, \text{ads} = 250 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 75 \, \text{dollars/ad} \times 15 \, \text{ads} = 1125 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 \, \text{dollars} + 1125 \, \text{dollars} = 1375 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

\[

"To determine the total number of windows in John's two houses, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows in both houses is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}

"To find out how much change the mother gets back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
\]

First, add $4.20 and $9.45:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
\]

Next, add $1.35 to $13.65:

\[
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
\]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
\]

So, the change the cashier gives back is:

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. Subtract the stitches for the collar and the rosette from the total to find the stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[
\text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765
\]

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = 20 \times 40 = \$800
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

\[
\text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = 80 \times 30 = \$2400

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his practice separately and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song Lines:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene Lines:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines. Sean has to memorize a third of these lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene Lines:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of these lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up the lines Sean has to memorize from all parts:
\[ 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} + 54 \text{ (solo song)} = 138 \]

So, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This leaves us with:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first need to calculate the total time in minutes and then convert that time into hours.

Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole. Therefore, for 30 small holes, the time taken is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole. Therefore, for 15 large holes, the time taken is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for both types of holes gives the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour = 60 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute 20 for \( M + R \):
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, we calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, we calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length used by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the sterling silver beads by the length of one bead:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of stories each child wrote in the first week.
2. Calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by each child over the two weeks.

First, let's list the number of stories each child wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum the total number of stories written by each child over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars to find the number of 5-star rows.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. We know there are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each of these remaining rows has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour, the time it takes to travel the same 480 miles can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as \( A \) and the number of medals Izzy has as \( I \). According to the problem, Ali has 22 medals, so \( A = 22 \). Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so \( I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \).

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is \( A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \). The problem states that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out, which means the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 10 \times (A + I) = 10 \times 39 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is \( 390 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into her earnings rate.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
3. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in minutes is 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15 intervals.
5. Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is $75.

\[
\boxed{75}

"To determine the total points of Mike, Jim, and Tony after the fourth round, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.
3. Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.**

- Mike's points remain 21.
- Jim's points remain 18.
- Tony's points increase by 1 to 43.

Now, we sum the points of Mike, Jim, and Tony after the extra points are distributed:
\[ 21 + 18 + 43 = 82 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum up the activities for both days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
4. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner.

\[
\text{Total rice per meal} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.**

There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).

\[
\text{Total rice per day} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.**

There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\text{Total rice per week} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}
\]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Next, we sum the crates sold on these days:
\[
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

Therefore, Sam was \(55\) crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{55}

"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   Carmen's initial bid is $200.

2. **Bids from Others:**
   - The first other person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - The second other person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - The third other person bids $300 + $50 = $350.

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $350 + $50 = $400.
   - Then, Carmen bids again after the next person, so she bids $400 + $50 = $450.
   - Finally, Carmen bids again after the last person, so she bids $450 + $50 = $500.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Carmen paid is the sum of her bids: $400 + $450 + $500.

Let's calculate the total:
\[
400 + 450 + 500 = 1350

"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the cost of the miles driven plus the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, the final numerical answer is $31,800."

- Unsold books: 50
- Books sold: \(250 - 50 = 200\)
- Current year sales: 45 books
- First year sales: \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first and second years:

- First year sales: 90 books
- Second year sales: 45 books

Each book sells for $20. Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns his weekly bonus for each full week, we consider only the full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings for the 4 full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can find the number of people he beats by calculating 80% of 20.

\[ \text{Number of people John beats} = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

Since John arm wrestles 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beats.

\[ \text{Number of people John loses to} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
2. Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.**

The bakery produces 60 loaves each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning.
\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.**

Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced.
\[
\text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.**

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, we need to find half of the remaining 20 loaves.
\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as follows:

\[
2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 extra arms grow in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, 3 extra legs grow in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (new limbs)}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he has to spend on gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\). Then, six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
\[24 - 8 - 2 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 30 \).

The number of girls in the classroom is 3 times the number of boys, so the number of girls \( G \) is:
\[ G = 3 \times B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The number of nongendered children \( N \) is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the number of boys, so:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

The total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is \( 123 \)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. If there are 45 wires, we can find the number of poles by dividing the number of wires by 3.

Let's calculate the number of poles:
\[
\text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \(W\). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \(W\):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

So, the cost of the pen is $1. The final numerical answer is:

\[
1

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has and then find out how many boxes are needed to store all of them.

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Since Meg has 46 pencils, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream separately, and then combine these effects.

First, let's determine how much the coffee is weakened by cooling it by 65 degrees. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Therefore, cooling by 65 degrees will weaken the coffee by:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 780 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the addition of 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the weakening factor we calculated from the cooling. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is simply the weakening due to the cooling.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 780 \text{ milliliters} \]

\[
\boxed{780}

"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to understand the exchange rate and the outcome of the trades.

Given:
- 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
- 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records.

Let's denote the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since each new record requires 2 old records, the number of new records that can be obtained from \( x \) old records is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

We know that the 5 people leave with 7 new records. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
x = 7 \times 2
\]
\[
x = 14
\]

Thus, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know the monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so the monthly salary for each senior programmer is:
\[
2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Therefore, the total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salaries for junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more charging is required to reach 100% from 60%, and then convert the time required into hours.

1. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.
2. The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.
3. Therefore, to charge 40%, it will take \(40 \times 3 = 120\) minutes.
4. To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): \(120 \div 60 = 2\) hours.

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

The final numerical answer is:
2"

"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 in rewards. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer spent $43 on their current shopping trip. They can use the $4 in rewards from their last trip. So, the price after applying the rewards is:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes off:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtract the coupon amount from the discounted price:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- State tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8400}

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns.

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the four individuals (Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ).

To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Investment:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Price Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]
   The value of Maria's shares after the first year is:
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 2H + 4C = 2 \times 40 + 4 \times 20 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

First, let's denote the weights of the animals as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the weight of the pink frog.
- Let \( B \) be the weight of the blue beetle.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of the green toad.
- Let \( Y \) be the weight of the yellow snake.
- Let \( R \) be the weight of the red bird.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( P = B = G \)
2. \( P = Y - 10 \)
3. \( P = R + 20 \)
4. \( P = 50 \) pounds

Using the information \( P = 50 \) pounds, we can find the weights of the other animals:
- Since \( P = B = G \), the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
- Since \( P = Y - 10 \), the yellow snake weighs \( Y = P + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \) pounds.
- Since \( P = R + 20 \), the red bird weighs \( R = P - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \) pounds.

Now, we know the weights of all the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is the sum of the weights of the animals plus the weight of the container:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days) in June.

First, let's find out how much more Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day now is:

\[ \text{Total distance per day} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance Tyson runs in June is:

\[ \text{Cookies for son's lunch box} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over 7 days:
\[ \text{Cookies for husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies given to her son and the cookies her husband ate from the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies left for Jenny} = 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they made them:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much more they are making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we calculate the difference:

\[ \text{Difference in daily revenue} = \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage this difference is of the original daily revenue from tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue from tractors}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first determine her monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the monthly costs for food, treats, and medicine, we get:
     \[
     100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
     \[
     220 \times 12 = 2640 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga class.
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class.
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, we sum up all the durations:
\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)}
\]

Adding these together:
\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and the daisies require 30 plant pots, the roses will require:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 \text{ (daisies)} + 60 \text{ (roses)} = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over after purchasing the required 90 plant pots, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number she already had:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots} \]

Thus, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. After spending some money, she had the following transactions:
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

The equation representing the transactions and the remaining money is:
\[ 36 - S - 11 - 4 = \text{remaining money} \]

Since the remaining money is zero (because she spent all her money), we can set up the equation:
\[ 36 - S - 11 - 4 = 0 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 36 - S - 15 = 0 \]
\[ 21 - S = 0 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let \( T \) be the total time spent. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

\[ \$12 \text{ (toy cars)} + \$5 \text{ (teddy bears)} = \$17 \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer in a separate line.

\[
\boxed{21}

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the activities:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for the go-karts is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- She also wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.

Adding these costs together:
\[ 5 \text{ (mini-golf)} + 20 \text{ (go-karts)} + 5 \text{ (arcade tokens)} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After spending $30 on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the remaining $60 can be used for herself and her friends, and assuming each person (including Morgan) gets the same amount, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per person:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has in her pocket every day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the change she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Billy spent on candy. Since he started with $10 and bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{16}{3}} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third segments. The combined distance of the second and third segments is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third and back to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Thus, the train goes between services every \(\frac{1}{20}\) days, which is equivalent to 12 hours. However, the question asks for the number of days, so the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spent driving. We can break this down into two parts: the time taken for the trip to his friend's house and the time taken for the trip back home.

### Part 1: Trip to his friend's house
- Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
- Speed: 70 mph

The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So,
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

### Part 2: Trip back home
- Distance: 240 miles
- Speed: 80 mph

The time taken for this part of the trip is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

### Total Time
The total time for the round trip is the sum of the times for each part:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip took:

"First, let's determine the number of boys at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we sum these scores:
\[
15 + 18 = 33
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more points Jane needs to reach a total of at least 42 points. We set up the equation:
\[
\text{Total points needed} = 42
\]
\[
\text{Points already scored} = 33
\]

To find the additional points required, we subtract the points already scored from the total points needed:
\[
42 - 33 = 9
\]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4x - 5 \). Substituting \( x = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for various reasons is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 50. \]
Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]
This means that 31 customers were kicked out for these three reasons. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara scored 8 points. Therefore, after scoring 14 points, Erin has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 14 = 24 + 14 = 38 \text{ points} \]

This means that Erin had 38 points after scoring 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from 38:
\[ 38 - 14 = 24 \]

So, the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, we calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can find the number of faulty pieces by calculating 40% of the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment by \( N \). The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces of equipment is then \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

Next, we need to find the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment. Since the total cost of all pieces of equipment is $400,000, the cost of each piece of equipment is \( \frac{400000}{N} \). Therefore, the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
3. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep. These 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.
4. **Milk from the first half**: 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
5. **Milk from the second half**: 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day:

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we sum the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[
\text{Total number of apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the number of apples picked on Monday is 14, and the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday are 12 and 24 respectively, we have:

\[
\text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

1. Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

2. Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks.

3. Adding the socks from the pairs and the loose socks gives:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

4. Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
   \[
   50 \text{ total socks} - 35 \text{ washed socks} = 15 \text{ socks missed}
   \]

Thus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then determine the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

The formula for the total amount to be repaid (A) is given by:
\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($3,650),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (10% annual interest rate divided by 12 months),
- \( t \) is the time the money is borrowed for in years (5 months is \( \frac{5}{12} \) years).

First, calculate the monthly interest rate:
\[ r = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} = \frac{1}{120} \approx 0.008333 \]

Next, calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ A = 3650 \left(1 + 0.008333 \times \frac{5}{12}\right) \]
\[ A = 3650 \left(1 + 0.003479\right) \]
\[ A = 3650 \times 1.003479 \]
\[ A \approx 3663.47 \]

Now, since Karan pays an equal amount every month for 5 months, the monthly payment (M) is:
\[ M = \frac{A}{5} = \frac{3663.47}{5} \approx 732.69 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $732.69 per month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{732.69} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 67 \]"

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

First, we calculate \( 12.8 \times 5 \):

\[
12.8 \times 5 = 64
\]

Then, we divide by 2:

\[
64 \div 2 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[
L = 32 \text{ hectares}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 52 - 26 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each person has by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total parts of the ratio and then multiplying by their respective parts of the ratio.

First, we find the value of one part of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
\[
\text{Popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]
\[
\text{Popsicles Sam has} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's convert all the time Carol spent on each activity into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Then calculate the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption before and after the reduction.
3. Calculate the daily energy savings.
4. Compute the total energy savings over 30 days.

**Step 1: Energy Consumption per Hour**
The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

**Step 2: Daily Energy Consumption Before and After Reduction**
- **Before Reduction:** 
  - Energy used per hour = 900 watts
  - Hours used per day = 8
  - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day

- **After Reduction:**
  - Hours used per day = 8 - 5 = 3
  - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day

**Step 3: Daily Energy Savings**
- Daily energy savings = Energy consumption before reduction - Energy consumption after reduction
- Daily energy savings = 7200 watt-hours/day - 2700 watt-hours/day = 4500 watt-hours/day

**Step 4: Total Energy Savings Over 30 Days**
- Total energy savings over 30 days = Daily energy savings * 30 days
- Total energy savings over 30 days = 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135000 watt-hours

**Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**
- 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours
- Total energy savings in kilowatt-hours = 135000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is **135 kilowatt-hours**."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- 2 zebras with 17 stripes each.
- 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
- 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes.

First, we calculate the total number of stripes:
\[
2 \times 17 + 36 + 18
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
2 \times 17 = 34
\]
\[
34 + 36 = 70

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of corns and cannolis Allan has after the transactions and then find the combined total.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Since initially there are 40 cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he now has 100 cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns after buying fewer} = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   Now we add the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps from School and Home**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, the steps from school and home combined are:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Additional Steps**: He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.

4. **Remaining Steps**: After these steps, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total steps taken so far are:
   \[
   5,000 \text{ (from school and home)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} + 2,000 \text{ (remaining steps)} = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During Jog**: To find the steps taken during his jog, we subtract the total steps taken so far from the total goal:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ (total goal)} - 8,000 \text{ (total steps taken)} = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the library as soon as he finishes the book, which will be 30 minutes after he starts reading. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time he will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of employees in June:**
   - In May, the company hired 40 employees.
   - In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
   - Therefore, the number of employees who left in June is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).
   - The number of employees remaining in June is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in May:**
   - Each employee works 40 hours per week.
   - In May, the total number of hours worked by all employees is \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee} = 1600 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in June:**
   - Each employee works 40 hours per week.
   - In June, the total number of hours worked by all employees is \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee} = 1200 \text{ hours} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money paid in May:**
   - Each employee is paid $15 per hour.
   - The total amount paid in May is \( 1600 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 24000 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid in June:**
   - Each employee is paid $15 per hour.
   - The total amount paid in June is \( 1200 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 18000 \text{ dollars} \).

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid in both months:**
   - The total amount paid in May and June is \( 24000 \text{ dollars} + 18000 \text{ dollars} = 42000 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a special deal: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she only pays $1.50 (which is $3 - $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 \text{ (taffy)} + 1.50 \text{ (seashells)} + 4 \times 0.25 \text{ (magnets)} = 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $7.00, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 5% of the dangerous candles also explode.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the dangerous candles have this defect:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the sale price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount per blouse is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the sale price of each blouse is:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( J_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( J_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( J_{\text{avg}} \). According to the problem, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{tall}} = 30 \). She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, so \( J_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \). Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( J_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ J_{\text{tall}} + J_{\text{short}} + J_{\text{avg}} = 30 + 15 + J_{\text{avg}} = 45 + J_{\text{avg}} \]

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation:
\[ (45 + J_{\text{avg}}) + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + J_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \( \boxed{350} \)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
\[
c + d = 180 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
2c + d = 304 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into equation (1) to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

First, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Given that Peter's locker size is 5 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, if Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Substituting Zack's locker size into the equation:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

To find Timothy's locker size, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the size of Timothy's locker is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is calculated as follows:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50.
2. Subtract the number of cats carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats each carried away 5 cats, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. Calculate the number of cats remaining after the boats have taken their share. This is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Determine how many cats ran after the mouse. Since \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. Subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats to find out how many cats are left on the rock. This is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16):**
   - The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

4. **Remaining 6 months (months 17 to 22):**
   - The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = 6 months * $14/month = $84.

Now, we sum up all the costs to get the total cost for 2 years:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$48 + \$24 + \$112 + \$84 = \$268
\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is **$268**."
"Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ T = 28 \]
\[ J = T - 6 \]
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \]

The total cost of both jeans is:
\[ T + J = 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). So:
\[ S = 6 \]
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3}S = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = S - \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the price he paid for it. Let's denote the price he paid for the tattered jeans as \( P_T \). So:
\[ P_T = T - \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the price he paid for it. Let's denote the price he paid for the jogger jeans as \( P_J \). So:
\[ P_J = J - \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = 22 - 2 = 20 \]

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in the original cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ \boxed{570} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ bird feeders} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the feeders. The feeders can be divided into two categories: the ones she made herself and the ones she bought from the store. Let's assume she made 3 feeders herself and bought 3 feeders from the store. Each of the store-bought feeders attracts 20 birds, and each of the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means each of her feeders attract:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the feeders:
- The 3 feeders she made herself attract:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]
- The 3 feeders she bought from the store attract:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds expected to be in her garden each day:
\[ 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ birds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the soup**: 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we calculate \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \). So, the soup costs \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cost of the cake**: Half of the price of the bagel. So, the cake costs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his cards, so he sells \(\frac{2}{3}\) of them. The number of cards he sells is \(\frac{2}{3}x\).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 1x = x
\]

Kenny uses this money to buy a ticket to the amusement park and also has $50 in spending cash. The cost of the ticket is $100, so the total amount of money he needs is $150. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
x = 150

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hotdogs prepared:
- There were 40 guests, and the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
- Half of 40 guests is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) guests.
- These 20 guests each had 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) hotdogs.

Next, we need to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog:
- There were 40 guests, and each of these guests wanted a second hotdog.
- Since the caterer only prepared 40 hotdogs, only 40 guests could get a second hotdog.
- Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 40 - 40 = 0 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters, so the total number of letters is:

\[
6 + 7 = 13

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas in each container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas in each container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needed. Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert the amount of gas needed from gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left after buying the chips and candy bars. This means that 99% of his $5 was spent on chips and candy bars.

Calculate 99% of $5:
\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars. We know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory and her mom have eaten. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have:

\[ 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

The total weight of the pieces they have eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the pieces they have eaten from the total weight of the cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater, it will take Bernadette \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes to drive to the theater.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 16 minutes to drive to the theater, he will arrive at the theater 16 minutes after he leaves. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than the time Wayne will arrive.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave \(16 - 5 = 11\) minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature of 40 degrees, we get:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this from the temperature after the oven was on, we get:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to complete the triathlon, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times are:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time James takes for the run be \( R \) minutes. The total time James takes to complete the triathlon is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the equation for James's total time equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Movie C in minutes} = 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B in minutes} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A in minutes} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, for 16 miles the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which totals:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from the 31 sneakers sold to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from 31 sneakers} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is the cost price of all 48 sneakers, which is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from the two types of packets separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayon pieces:

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 21 = 17 + P \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the original cost per balloon.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.**

The cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To find the product:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]
\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]
\[
170 \times 65 = 10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, sum the distances to get the total distance:
\[120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\]

Now, calculate the total time taken:
\[2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\]

The car's average speed during the trip is \(\boxed{50}\) mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, the number of sapphires she has left is:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies she received. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required to fill all the raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions:
- Width: 2 feet
- Length: 8 feet
- Height: 2 feet

The volume of one raised bed is:
\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of green and yellow cards based on the given information and then find the total number of cards.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - Calculate 60% of 15:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Add this to the number of red cards to find the number of green cards:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk over the three weeks.
2. Divide the total number of minutes he needs to walk by the total number of days he will walk.

First, we know that three weeks is equal to 21 days (since 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the new shoes. He plans to walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the total number of days:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth (if necessary), we get:

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (allergic to both)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This is given by the formula for the union of two sets:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since Tom and his wife are both going, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but because it is a busy weekend, the price is 20% more expensive. To find the increased price per day, we calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
So, the hotel costs $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after applying the discount and the coupon, and then find the cost per razor.

First, let's determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:
- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost before any discounts is:
  \[
  2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she gets 2 packs for free. Therefore, she only pays for 2 packs:
- The cost for 2 packs is $8.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $8.00:
- The total cost after the coupon is:
  \[
  8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Heather is buying 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she is buying a total of:

\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. The total number of cheerleaders is 10, which matches the number of levels in the pyramid.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the cheerleaders:

\[
\text{Total height} = 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[
\text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine Angela's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Brett's current age is 14 years. In four years, Brett's age will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, in four years Angela's age will be:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Let \( A \) be Angela's current age. In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We know that in four years Angela's age is 42, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve the equation by isolating \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Thus, Angela's current age is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by both Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- Food for each guest is included in the price, so the total cost per guest is $25.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

- Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364\) yards.
- Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364\) yards.

Let's calculate these values:

- Mariah's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91\) yards.
- Her grandma's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182\) yards.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of yarn used:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 273 \]"

"Let's denote the width of the chair as \( C \), the width of the rug as \( R \), and the length of the couch as \( L \).

From the problem statement, we know:
1. The chair is 3 feet wide, so \( C = 3 \) feet.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so \( R = C + 5 \).
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so \( L = 2R + 2 \).

First, we calculate the width of the rug:
\[ R = C + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the length of the couch:
\[ L = 2R + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is \( 18 \) feet.

The final numerical answer is:

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces and 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24.

The cost of a 2 x 4 piece of wood is $4, so with $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4} \]

The cost of a 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6, so with $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8} \]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

From 6 pieces of 2 x 4:
\[ 6 \text{ pieces} \times 200 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

From 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces} \times 400 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[ 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1200 \]"

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months and days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of raisins available:**
   Heather has 27 cups of raisins.

2. **Divide the raisins equally among the three recipes:**
   Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide the total amount of raisins by 3.
   \[
   \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies:**
   Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide 9 by \(\frac{3}{4}\).
   \[
   9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly consumption and cost for both scenarios.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device.**

- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost before adding the new device:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device.**

- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Combined daily consumption:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after adding the new device:
\[ \$21.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$147.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the weekly costs.**

Difference in weekly cost:
\[ \$147.00/\text{week} - \$126.00/\text{week} = \$21.00/\text{week} \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one person paints and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, in one day, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10}\) of a house.

2. **Determine the rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day.

3. **Determine the time for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day, they will need 2 days to paint a whole house.

4. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \) and the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so the total for Ophelia is \( 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so the total for Jenna is \( 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these totals together, we get:
\[ 42 + 130 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid a total of $48 for a CD and a headphone set, and the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $48 - $44 = $44. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with $44 is:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, the number of more CDs Tom would have been able to buy is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, let's establish the pattern:
- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, we calculate the total hours for each group of weeks:
1. For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of hours worked out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, in 8 years, his cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - Since his cousin will be 65 in 8 years, his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \).

4. **Calculate the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - His cousin's current age is 57.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \).

Thus, the number of years separating the age of Jame and his cousin now is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break down the information given:

- There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- The boys brought back 60 seashells each.
- The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

First, we calculate the number of boys and girls:
- Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided equally into girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:
- Each boy brought 60 seashells.
- Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is \(10 \times 60 = 600\).

Now, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys:
- The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
- Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is \(4 \times 60 = 240\).

Thus, the total number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ 60 + 240 = 300 \]

So, each girl brought 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:

3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves in the second half of April and how much he saves in the first half of April.

First, let's denote the number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves in the first half of April. Since the second half of April has 15 days, he saves \( 2x \) in the second half of April.

The total savings for the month of April is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375 \]

So, Elvis saves \( x = 375 \) dollars in the first half of April. For the second half of April, he saves \( 2x = 2 \times 375 = 750 \) dollars.

Thus, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{750}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have together is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

- Time to swim 3 miles in cold water = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
- Time to swim 3 miles in warm water = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
- Difference = 102 - 48 = 54 minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40, and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is:

\[ 160 \]

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Determine the number of buttons with two holes:**
   - There are 7 buttons with two holes.

2. **Determine the number of buttons with four holes:**
   - The total number of buttons is 21.
   - Therefore, the number of buttons with four holes is:
     \[
     21 - 7 = 14
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes:**
   - Each of the 7 buttons has 2 holes.
   - Therefore, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes:**
   - Each of the 14 buttons has 4 holes.
   - Therefore, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
     \[
     14 \times 4 = 56
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons:**
   - Add the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily coffee intake for both Octavia and Juan, and then find out how much Juan must reduce his intake to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Determine Octavia's daily coffee intake:**
   - Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( R \).
   - Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee per day.

2. **Determine Juan's daily coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee per day.

3. **Juan's doctor's recommendation:**
   - The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

4. **Calculate the reduction needed for Juan:**
   - Juan's current intake is \( 5R \) cups.
   - The doctor's recommendation is 4 cups.
   - The reduction needed is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not specify the value of \( R \), the final numerical answer in terms of \( R \) is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is the sum of their weights divided by the number of people (which is 3).

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved 10 hours upward from the tip of the pyramid.

Initially, the angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle (32 degrees) plus the angle the sun has moved upward (50 degrees):

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]

Let's confirm this with a simple Python code snippet.
```python
# Initial angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid
initial_angle = 32

# Rate of movement of the sun upward
rate_of_movement = 5

# Time the sun moves
time_moving = 10

# Calculate the angle the sun moves upward
angle_moved_upward = rate_of_movement * time_moving

# Calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun
final_angle = initial_angle + angle_moved_upward
print(final_angle)
```
```output
82

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since James needs a candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages she read in the first week and add that to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:
\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

Shiloh's current age is 44 years. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, the nephew's age will be:
\[ x + 7 \]

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is \( 10 \) years.

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate the total amount step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   1 \text{ tooth} \times \$1.00 = \$1.00
   \]
   Since this happened three times:
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - The amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00.
   - Half of $1.00 is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = \$0.50
   \]
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much money he spends each day and then how many action figures he buys over the week.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Peter spends each day. Since he spends an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide his total money by 7:
\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spends $5 on each wooden action figure. The total cost for wooden action figures over these 4 days is:
\[
\text{Total cost for wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]
Since he spends $10 each day, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{20}{5} = 4
\]

Now, we calculate how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures. He spends $10 each day for 4 days, so he spends:
\[
\text{Money spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]
Thus, the remaining money is:
\[
\text{Remaining money} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:
\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Finally, we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures:
\[
\text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 15 = 19
\]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows per week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses per week} \]

Now, we determine the difference between the number of roses ordered by the flower shops and the number of roses Ford grows:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we calculate the total number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ roses} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature. Now, we need to find the temperature setting \( T \) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, the set temperature \( T \) should be such that:
\[ 450 \times (1 + 0.04) = 450 \times 1.04 = 468 \]

We need to find \( T \) such that:
\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount:**
   - The original price of one box is $100.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is \(100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00\).
   - The discounted price per box is \(100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00\).
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is \(90.00 \times 2 = 180.00\).

2. **Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes:**
   - Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
   - Therefore, 2 boxes contain \(90 \times 2 = 180\) contacts.
   - Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the total number of pairs is \(180 \div 2 = 90\).

3. **Calculate the cost per pair of contacts:**
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00.
   - The total number of pairs is 90.
   - The cost per pair is \(180.00 \div 90 = 2.00\).

So, the cost per pair of contacts is **$2.00**."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

So, on Saturday:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

And on Sunday:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total hours John worked is:
\[ \text{Total hours John worked} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's earnings:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (from aerobics) + 600 calories (from running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]

The number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the three measurements. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, after some lessons it increased to 52 WPM, and if he continues to increase his speed by 5 words per minute, his next speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and then divide by 3.

The sum of the three measurements is:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference in weight is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is \(2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings for the first 4 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings for the next 2 hours is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washes. Therefore, each pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. We need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The cost of the bottle is $24.00, and since there are 2 pumps in the bottle, the cost per pump is:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is also a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, it costs an additional \(\boxed{65560}\) dollars to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Duration of Research:**
   The total duration of the research is 10 times the initial 5 months.
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Funding for Subsequent Months:**
   The first 5 months cost $100,000. The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) require 50% more funding per month.
   \[
   \text{Funding per month for the remaining 45 months} = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
   \]

4. **Total Funding for Subsequent Months:**
   Calculate the total funding for the 45 months.
   \[
   45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000
   \]

5. **Total Cost of Research:**
   Add the initial funding to the funding for the subsequent months.
   \[
   100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{6850000}

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of poles across all intersections.
2. Determine the total number of street lights.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, we calculate the total number of poles across all intersections. Since there are 6 poles at each intersection and there are 4 intersections, the total number of poles is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles} \]

Next, since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

We are given that 20 street lights are not working. Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to account for all the gum he consumes and gives away.

1. **Gum consumed during school hours:**
   - Jim is at school for 8 hours.
   - He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours.
   - Therefore, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum during school hours.

2. **Gum consumed on the way home:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

3. **Gum consumed after dinner:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

4. **Total gum consumed:**
   - Total pieces of gum consumed = 4 (during school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.

5. **Gum given to his sister:**
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed.
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of pieces of gum.
   - After consuming 6 pieces, the remaining pieces of gum are \( x - 6 \).
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives \( \frac{x - 6}{2} \) pieces to his sister.
   - The remaining pieces of gum after giving to his sister are \( \frac{x - 6}{2} \).

6. **Initial number of pieces of gum:**
   - Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

7. **Remaining pieces of gum after giving to his sister:**
   - Substitute \( x = 20 \) into the equation for remaining pieces of gum:
   - Remaining pieces of gum = \( \frac{20 - 6}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \).

Thus, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height in feet. Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the company's cost is:

\[ \text{Company's cost} = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the company's cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. So, we calculate 25% of 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]
So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, we calculate 60% of 25:
\[ 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]
So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = 2000 \)
- The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, so \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \).
- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so \( S = G - 400 \).

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \).

\[
\boxed{4800}

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as \( t \) hours.

In \( t \) hours, Bob will have traveled \( 55t \) miles.
In \( t \) hours, Tom will have traveled \( 70t \) miles.

Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead, the distance Tom travels in \( t \) hours must be 75 miles more than the distance Bob travels in \( t \) hours. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 70t = 55t + 75 \]

Now, we solve for \( t \):
\[ 70t - 55t = 75 \]
\[ 15t = 75 \]
\[ t = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ t = 5 \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( C \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[
C = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

According to the parents' condition, they will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. Since the current cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can miss any number of classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Thus, Manny can miss all 10 classes and still meet the parents' condition.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's customers per day} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's customers per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total customers per day} = \text{Jewel's customers per day} + \text{Julie's customers per day} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total number of customers processed in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers per week} = \text{Total customers per day} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. According to the problem, Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let's denote Lynn's distance as \( L \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation by subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Thus, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, we sum all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

Adding these amounts step-by-step:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000
\]
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000

"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. Therefore, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since each suit costs $750, the cost of each pair of dress pants is:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and since he buys 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the daily average publications and the number of days in February.

First, we calculate the total number of articles published by the news website in February:
- The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

\[
\text{Total articles by news website} = 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February:
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

\[
\text{Total articles by sister company} = 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles}
\]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:

\[
\text{Total articles} = 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles}

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we sum the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the 20 pomegranates on Tuesday.

The original price per pomegranate was $20, and Clara bought 20 pomegranates. So, the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Clara received a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the 20 pomegranates on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before any discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800. 

Next, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   James gets 1 hour of free carriage time. Therefore, he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - The second hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
   - The third hour is twice the cost of the second hour, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Cost of the first hour: $15
   - Cost of the second hour: $30
   - Cost of the third hour: $60

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Her weekly wage should be $300. Therefore, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week:

\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ whole eggs/deviled egg half}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
\]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**

"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. It took her half the combined cooking time of pork and rice to cook beans, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 + 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total cooking time for all the food:

"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. Therefore, we can write the following equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, we substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time spent sleeping by all the math teachers is:

\[
\text{Total time spent sleeping} = 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they share equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120. Therefore, Kassidy has:
\[
Kassidy = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna has:
\[
Rayna = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to find the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. We do this by adding the amounts of candy each person has:

\[
3 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total amount of candy equally among the three people. We do this by dividing the total amount of candy by 3:

\[
\frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 candies of type A. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining 6 days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The first of these three days is good.
- The second is neutral.
- The third is good.

Adding these to the existing good days:
\[
8 \text{ (initial good days)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} = 10 \text{ good days}
\]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches by dividing the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine how many toys James currently has and how many he needs initially.

James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, each dog currently has 1 toy.

There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so James needs 8 more toys to give each of these 8 dogs a toy. Therefore, he needs 8 toys initially.

After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 4 dogs, so twice as many more dogs means there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) more dogs. This means there are now \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs in total.

Since each of these 12 dogs needs a toy, James needs 12 more toys. Adding these to the 8 toys he already bought, he now needs \(8 + 12 = 20\) toys.

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Since he already had 20 toys, and 3 dogs no longer need toys, he can return 3 toys. Therefore, he still needs \(20 - 3 = 17\) toys.

The total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to follow the sequence of investments step by step.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. We want to find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes.

The proportion can be set up as follows:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]
\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]
\[ x = 6 \times 96 \]
\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Jack's weight is also 80 kg. Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults gives:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem, Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.

Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.

We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
\[ C + 7 = 68 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 68 - 7 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, we can find out how many cookies Max has:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \]

And how many cookies Summer has:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} = 68 + 73 + 96 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 96 = 237 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{237} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time for each half separately and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = \(\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = \(\frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we sum the times for both halves:
- Total time = Time in ""turtle"" mode + Time in ""rabbit"" mode
- Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

\[

"To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = 1 kilo * $4/kilo = $4.

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, we sum the costs of the apples, bananas, and oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of bananas} + \text{Cost of oranges} = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract these from the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 13 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Let's denote the cost of one candy as \( c \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 + 4 \times c = 3.20 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2.00 + 4c = 3.20 \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 4c = 3.20 - 2.00 \]
\[ 4c = 1.20 \]
\[ c = \frac{1.20}{4} \]
\[ c = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month and per year:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves \(20 \times 12 = 240\) coins per year.

Next, we calculate how many coins Rong saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Rong saves \(240 \times 10 = 2400\) coins.

Now, let's determine how many coins Neil saves per month:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

Next, we calculate how many coins Neil saves per year:
- Neil saves \(28 \times 12 = 336\) coins per year.

Now, we calculate how many coins Neil saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Neil saves \(336 \times 10 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we sum the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- The total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and John needs 2 vaccines:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the heartworm check costs \( 0.60 \times T \).

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the two vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each colored square and then sum these to get the total number of squares. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each square contributes 1 square foot to the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red Squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green Squares} = \text{Blue Squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White Squares} = \text{Green Squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of square to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
\text{Total Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + \text{Blue Squares} + \text{Green Squares} + \text{White Squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement} = 2400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ \text{Amount for car payment} = 2400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left.

\[ \text{Amount left} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2/\text{drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2/\text{snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10/\text{person} = \$200 \]

Thus, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we start by defining the capacities of the trucks of Gissela, Gordy, and Gary.

1. **Gissela's Truck:**
   - Capacity: 4,000 pounds

2. **Gordy's Truck:**
   - Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
   - Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

3. **Gary's Truck:**
   - Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck in pounds.
   - The combined capacity of all three trucks is given as 11,600 pounds.

We can set up the equation for the total capacity of the three trucks:
\[
4000 + 4800 + G = 11600
\]

4. **Solving for \( G \):**
   - Combine the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:
     \[
     4000 + 4800 = 8800
     \]
   - Substitute this sum into the equation:
     \[
     8800 + G = 11600
     \]
   - Isolate \( G \) by subtracting 8800 from both sides:
     \[
     G = 11600 - 8800
     \]
     \[
     G = 2800
     \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings each person ate and then sum them up.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives us the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours are required to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]
4. Assuming they raise an equal amount each hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, they raise:
   \[
   \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
5. To find the number of hours required to raise $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:
   \[
   \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
6. Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional 6 hours, the total number of hours required is:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used for industrial purposes by the city.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by the city is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes by the city, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ \boxed{68\%} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production for 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]

- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:
Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:
Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many scoops Erin can buy given the deal and her budget.

First, let's understand the deal: ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops.

Next, we calculate how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with her $6.00.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 2 scoops, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00, so the number of sets of 2 scoops she can buy is:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

Since each set of 2 scoops includes 3 scoops in total, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over the two-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries.

The cost to go picking is a fixed $20. The cost per pound of blueberries is $1.5, and he picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the fixed cost to the cost of the blueberries gives the total cost James incurred:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James incurred from the cost of buying at the store:

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she taps her feet.

1. **Determine the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:**
   - Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute.
   - Helga taps her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
   - Therefore, the combined rate when her arms are at her sides is \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
   - For 3 minutes (since she dances for 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 minutes), the number of taps is \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps.

2. **Determine the number of taps when her arms are raised:**
   - Helga taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute.
   - Helga taps her left foot at 200 taps per minute.
   - Therefore, the combined rate when her arms are raised is \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices eaten and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices eaten by each of these five friends is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since there are five friends, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices eaten by each of these two friends is:

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining people.
4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with step 1:

- Total number of people initially: 5000
- Number of people who had voted by midday: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

So, the number of people remaining after midday is:

- Remaining people: \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \)

Next, for step 3:

- Number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining people: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

- People who had not voted: \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \)

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. So, the total number of smores needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores/kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore/adult} = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this as:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
\]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
\]
Substituting the father's age:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[
\boxed{87}

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \text{ of } 20) = 20 + 0.50 \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. The votes received by candidate A and candidate B are 20 and 30 respectively. Therefore, the votes received by candidate C are:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, the number of votes candidate C got is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After receiving these 10 apples, the number of apples Beck has is:

\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, Boris has given away 10 apples, so the number of apples Boris has is:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Clara has two times as many books as Steven. We are given that Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2S = 20
\]

Solving for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[
A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We already know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[
20 - 16 = 4
\]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students like to play video games. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

First, we calculate the number of students who like to play music. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times \text{Number of students who like to play basketball} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we find the total number of students who like to either bake, play basketball, or play music:

\[ \text{Total number of students who like baking, basketball, or music} = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many students like to play video games:

\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Total number of students who like baking, basketball, or music} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many birds were scared away by the stone. Jeremy initially saw 12 birds, and 1/3 of that number were scared away.

\]

So, the number of birds remaining after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 2 slices on the plate.
2. Mara adds 3 more slices to the plate. So, the number of slices becomes \(2 + 3 = 5\).
3. Mara then triples the number of slices on the plate. So, the number of slices becomes \(5 \times 3 = 15\).
4. Mara eats 2 slices. So, the number of slices left is \(15 - 2 = 13\).
5. Mara's friend steals 5 slices. So, the number of slices left is \(13 - 5 = 8\).

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. We do this by adding the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses:

\[ 8 \text{ (dogs)} + 5 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (birds)} + 12 \text{ (horses)} = 28 \text{ (animals)} \]

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ (animals)}}{7 \text{ (days)}} = 4 \text{ (animals per day)} \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[76 - 48 = 28\]

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Sean has:**
   Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has}

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the 54 students were divided into 12 groups.

We start by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]
Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups. This means that 12 groups are not possible with 54 students.

Next, we need to find out how many groups can be formed with 54 students if each group has an equal number of students. We do this by finding the divisors of 54. The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.

Since we are forming groups of equal size and we need to form more than 6 groups, we look for the largest divisor that is greater than 6. The largest divisor of 54 that is greater than 6 is 9. Therefore, if we form groups of 9 students each, we can form:
\[
\frac{54}{9} = 6 \text{ groups}
\]
This confirms that 6 groups of 9 students each can be formed from 54 students.

Since 12 groups are not possible, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:
\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To find out how many chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.

For a single week:
- Weekday rental: \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.
- Weekend rental: \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.
- Total weekly rental: \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

Now, for two 4-week months:
- Total weeks in two 4-week months: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weeks.
- Total rental in 8 weeks: \(8 \times 500 = 4000\) chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know the monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, each roommate's monthly cost is:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses equals \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen plates equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we subtract the broken items from the total sent.

For the glasses:
- Total sent: 96 glasses
- Broken: 10 glasses
- Remaining: \(96 - 10 = 86\) glasses

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20.
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60.
   - Total buttons: \( 20 + 60 = 80 \).

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):

"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people that is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we start by defining the total number of puppies as \( P \).

Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express the number of Pomeranian puppies as:
\[
\frac{2}{3}P
\]

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P
\]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 9:
\[
2P = 54
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[
P = 27
\]

Therefore, the total number of puppies Jana has is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister has an allowance of $90. Half of this amount is:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Jayden receives $45 from his sister. Adding this to the $70 he already had, we get:
\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The cost of the new camera is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Thus, Jayden needs an additional \(\boxed{85}\) dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to calculate how many pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

Given:
- George has 200 bananas.
- He has 45% more pears than bananas.

First, calculate 45% of the number of bananas:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = \frac{45}{100} \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than the 200 bananas. Therefore, the number of pears George has is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

1. Determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour.
2. Calculate the total number of books Ezra read after deciding to read 150 more.
3. Sum the books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Therefore, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing the number of books Ezra read by 2:

\[ \text{Books Ahmed read} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra read in total. Ezra initially read 300 books and then decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

\[ \text{Total books Ezra read} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed to get the final answer:

\[ \text{Total books read} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Therefore, her earnings for the hours taught on Monday are:
  \[
  4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300
  \]
- Additionally, since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an extra $5 per day.
- Therefore, her additional earnings for Monday are:
  \[
  \$5
  \]
- Her total earnings for Monday are:
  \[
  \$300 + \$5 = \$305
  \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Therefore, her earnings for the hours taught on Wednesday are:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60
  \]
- Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
  \[
  \$60
  \]

**Total Earnings for Two Days:**
- Adding her earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
  \[
  \$305 + \$60 = \$365
  \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total driving time and add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He has 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \] wheels.

"First, let's determine the number of movies in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200
\]

Next, we find the number of movies that are not in series:

\[
\text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
\]

Out of these 400 non-series movies, 40% are older movies. We calculate the number of older movies:

\[
\text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
\]

The remaining non-series movies are not older:

\[
\text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the non-series movies is $10 each. The cost of the older movies is $5 each.

The total cost for the series movies is:

\[
\text{Cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
\]

The total cost for the non-series movies is:

\[
\text{Cost of non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
\]

The total cost for the older movies is:

\[
\text{Cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
\]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost to replace the movies:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4400}

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:
\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
Thus, their hiking speed is:
\[
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is:
\[
20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is:
\[
50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[
300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[
\boxed{330}

"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can express these relationships as:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (30 - 4) = 30 \times 26 = 780 \) (since finishing 4 seconds slower means they each lose 4 seconds, and the total time is 30 seconds, so the difference is 4 seconds)

Now, let's calculate the points for Ava and Emma:
- Ava's points: \( 10 \times 8 + 5 \times 3 + 780 = 80 + 15 + 780 = 875 \)
- Emma's points: \( 10 \times 0 + 5 \times 0 + 780 = 780 \)

The difference in their scores is:
\[ 875 - 780 = 95 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
   \[
   30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Divide the combined cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
- They ride for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying \(O\) orange and \(W\) white fish, the total number of fish in the pond became \(7 + O + W\).

The problem states that after adding the fish, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish. So, the number of orange fish became \(3 + O\) and the number of white fish became \(4 + W\). According to the problem, we have the equation:
\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

We also know that the total number of fish added is 17, so:
\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

Let's solve the first equation for \(O\):
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O = 5 + 2W\]

Now substitute \(O = 5 + 2W\) into the second equation:
\[5 + 2W + W = 17\]
\[5 + 3W = 17\]
\[3W = 12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 5 + 2W\):
\[O = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13\]

We can verify the solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish.
- He bought 13 orange and 4 white fish, making the total number of fish \(7 + 13 + 4 = 24\).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \(3 + 13 = 16\) and the number of white fish is \(4 + 4 = 8\).
- Indeed, 16 is twice 8, satisfying the condition of the problem.

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

For 5 days a week:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch is:

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much more money John needs after accounting for the school's contribution.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school's contribution is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

John currently has $50. After the school's contribution, the remaining amount John needs is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

Since John already has $50, the additional amount he needs is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

So, John is missing $100. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the temperature during the night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the temperature during the night is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing 90 by 9:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups. Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups had members bring back seashells. Therefore, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

This means 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Since each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Initially, the train has 172 people. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So the number of people on the train after the first stop is:

\[ 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 + 13 = 151 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off. So the number of people on the train after the second stop is:

\[ 151 - 38 = 113 \]

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 113.

\[
\boxed{113}

"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien collects in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the value of these bottle caps in dollars.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. Therefore, in a 30-day month, he will find:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

The special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie earned from her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours last Tuesday. Out of these, 8 hours are regular hours and the remaining 3 hours are additional hours.

The earnings from the regular hours are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

The earnings from the additional hours are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives Jamie's total earnings for the day:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Jamie was paid for her work last Tuesday is:

"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are on sale for 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[
\text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we subtract the sale price from $50.00:

\[
\text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage of his employment:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage:**
   \[
   \text{Initial wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after raise} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after second raise} = \$10.50 + \$1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours of work for both Billy and Sally.

**Billy's total earnings:**
\[
\text{Total earnings for Billy} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = 20 \times 11.50 = \$230
\]

**Sally's hourly wage:**
\[
\text{Sally's hourly wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

**Sally's total earnings:**
\[
\text{Total earnings for Sally} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = 20 \times 10.50 = \$210

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it.

Pierson's score = 278 points

Half of Pierson's score = \( \frac{278}{2} = 139 \) points

Nikita's score = Half of Pierson's score + 11 = 139 + 11 = 150 points

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428 points

The final numerical answer is 428."
"First, we need to determine the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. So, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the next week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the next week, we get:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car's speed is 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car's speed is 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars after 2 hours:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the pass rates for each grade and then find the average of these rates.

First, let's calculate the pass rate for the third graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for third graders} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \]

Next, the pass rate for the fourth graders is given as:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \]

The pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fifth graders} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \]

Now, we need to find the overall pass rate for the entire school. The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students. The total number of students is:
\[ 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \]

The total number of students who passed is:
\[ 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \]

So, the overall pass rate is:
\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is:

"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, we need to convert the total quarts of tea into gallons. Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Orders and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 butterscotch candies.

2. **Remaining Candies After Sales:**
   - Since he sold 150 candies out of the 100 he initially ordered, he would have sold more than he had ordered. This means he has already sold all 100 candies and more, which implies he has sold 100 candies and has 50 more to sell from the initial order.
   - Therefore, after selling 100 candies, he has 0 candies left from the initial order.

3. **Additional Orders:**
   - Dale then ordered 100 more candies.

4. **Total Candies Now:**
   - He now has 0 (remaining from initial order) + 100 (new order) = 100 candies.

5. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - Since he has 100 candies and has already sold 100 candies, he needs to sell 0 more candies to sell all of his candy.

Thus, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is \(\boxed{0}\)."
"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then find the difference from the initial number of students.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's sum these petals to find the total number of petals initially:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and lost is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and losing 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{14}{2} \right\rfloor = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money is used by Jack and his friends to play the game for 4 hours.

First, let's convert the total play time from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the play time for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Each of the two worse friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
\[ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends:
\[ \text{Total play time} = 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for 240 minutes in total, we need to determine how many sets of 70 minutes fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240}{70} \approx 3.43 \]

Since they can only play in whole sets of 70 minutes, they can play for 3 full sets of 70 minutes, which totals:
\[ 3 \times 70 = 210 \text{ minutes} \]

The remaining time is:
\[ 240 - 210 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the number of quarters needed for the remaining 30 minutes:
- Jack needs 1 quarter for 20 minutes, so for 30 minutes, he needs:
\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ quarters} \]
- Since Jack can only use whole quarters, he will use 2 quarters for the remaining 30 minutes.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters needed for the 210 minutes of play:
- Each of the two worse friends can play for 10 minutes with one quarter, so for 210 minutes, they need:
\[ \frac{210}{10} = 21 \text{ quarters} \]
- The better friend can play for 30 minutes with one quarter, so he needs:
\[ \frac{30}{30} = 1 \text{ quarter} \]

Adding up all the quarters:
\[ 2 \text{ (for Jack)} + 21 \text{ (for the two worse friends)} + 1 \text{ (for the better friend)} = 24 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, the total amount of money used is:

"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) in the equation for oil:
\[ O = 2S \]

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total mixture equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
\[ 3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = 3 \times 500 = \$1500 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
\[ 2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = 2 \times 1500 = \$3000 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[ \$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4500} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has initially:
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:
\[ \text{Number of cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:
\[ \text{Number of cars given to his mother} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We subtract the number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars Joe had:
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe remains with} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine how much money the students raised in total. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she spent walking each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. 

Next, we need to calculate the time she spent walking on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she spent walking on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent walking over the two days:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

Since the question asks for the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"First, let's determine the number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars in the parking lot at the start of the lunch break was:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot at the end of the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, calculate the daily earnings:

"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate the points scored in each game separately and then sum them up.

**First Game:**
- Sasha scored 14 points.
- Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

**Second Game:**
- Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
- Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points.

Now, we sum the points Sasha scored in both games:
- Points scored by Sasha in the first game: 14
- Points scored by Sasha in the second game: 4

Total points scored by Sasha:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know \( P \), we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, we sum up all the eggs:

\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

So, the total number of eggs Cindy has is 27.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we'll find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refund amount from Amazon:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
   - The net loss is \(3.00 - 24.00 = -21.00\) dollars.
   - Since the net loss is negative, it means Milly actually gains $21.00.

Therefore, Milly will gain $21.00, not lose any money. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup each week is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on TikTok-related activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes (TikTok videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (writing songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \frac{1128}{60} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{18.8} \]"
"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost Calculation:**
   - The base cost for the installation is $129.00.
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base cost already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

2. **Additional Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.
   - Total additional cost = 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) * $15.00 = 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Total cost = Base cost + Additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Thus, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships step by step, starting from the information about Pompei.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches} \).

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes them to cross the highway. We can then use this information to determine how long it will take four turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo to cross the same distance.

First, let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \) and the speed of each kangaroo as \( v \). The total time taken by 3 kangaroos to cross the highway is given as 18 hours. The total distance \( D \) can be expressed in terms of the speed and time as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v. \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to cross the distance \( D \) is given by:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2vt. \]
Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 54v = 2vt. \]
By dividing both sides by \( 2v \), we get:
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27. \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by defining the number of dishes each person made based on the information given.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 400 + 50 \]
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 450 \]

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract $230 from $450:
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 450 - 230 = 220 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into this equation, we get \( 60 = 2S \), which means \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so together Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so together Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"To determine the total number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at both math and English, as well as those who are only good at math.

Given:
- Total number of students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students performing well in English only = 8
- Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students performing well in English only)

Let's calculate the number of students good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Students good at both math and English} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both math and English} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then fit this into the total show duration.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we include the intermission time:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} \]

Now, we add the intermission time to the total time for one group:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform within the 120-minute duration, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (3 years).

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ I = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ A = P + I = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. We know that half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so the other half do not have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
\[
50 - 20 = 30
\]

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. We already calculated that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. The difference is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

\text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Sum the remaining goats from both farms.

First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm:
- From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm:
- The number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- The number of goats left in Farm Y is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total number of goats left:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year (12 months) is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we need to clean one-half of them, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
   \[
   \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
15

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we sum the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), substituting \( B = Y + 3 \) gives \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To verify, we can calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, and he will have 2 extra glue sticks, 7 packs is the correct number. Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people from the previous day.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is 60. Adding these to the initial 10 infected people:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]
Thus, after Day 1, there are 70 infected people.

**Day 2:**
Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, the number of new infections on Day 2 is 420. Adding these to the 70 infected people from the previous day:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]
Thus, after Day 2, there are 490 infected people.

**Day 3:**
Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]
So, the number of new infections on Day 3 is 2940. Adding these to the 490 infected people from the previous day:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]
Thus, after Day 3, there are 3430 infected people.

The final number of infected people after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total amount by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[
40 \text{ customers} \times 20 \text{ dollars/customer} = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ dollars} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the combined total:

\[
800 \text{ dollars} + 720 \text{ dollars} = 1520 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In a year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire takes 1 month to earn a badge, Amber takes \(1 \times 2 = 2\) months to earn a badge.
   - In a year, Amber earns \(12 \div 2 = 6\) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In a year, Wendy earns \(12 \times 3 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges.
   - Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85
\]
\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]
\[
3A = 85 - 37
\]
\[
3A = 48
\]
\[
A = \frac{48}{3}

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - Since each bottle of water costs $2.00, 2 bottles will cost \( 2.00 \times 2 = 4.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

5. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water
   - Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:

\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

David has $12.48 initially. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"

"First, we need to determine the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles. Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him more marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

\[ 60 \]"

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find out the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Julie's glasses} + \text{Micah's glasses} + \text{Mitchell's glasses} = 32 \]

Substituting the known value for Julie's glasses:

\[ 14 + \text{Micah's glasses} + \text{Micah's glasses} = 32 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 14 + 2 \times \text{Micah's glasses} = 32 \]

To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we subtract 14 from 32 and then divide by 2:

\[ 2 \times \text{Micah's glasses} = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{Micah's glasses} = 18 \]
\[ \text{Micah's glasses} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ \text{Micah's glasses} = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ \text{Julie's glasses} - \text{Micah's glasses} = 14 - 9 = 5 \]

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use the $40 profit to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total profit by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since the rope is sold in whole meters, Sarah can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost for 26 meters} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total profit to find out how much money Sarah will have left over.

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age first. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Thus, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

"To find the total number of chimichangas made by Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: The shop makes 125 chimichangas.
2. **Wednesday**: The shop also makes 125 chimichangas.
3. **Friday**: The shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesday. Since they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday, on Friday they make \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is:

2. Calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants.
3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.
4. Calculate the number of flowering plants.
5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Number of indoor plants = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\).

2. Remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants = \(100 - 25 = 75\).

3. Number of outdoor plants = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50\).

4. Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants = \(75 - 50 = 25\).

5. Percentage of flowering plants = \(\left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \times 100 = 25\%\).

"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
\]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second}

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

First, let's identify the cost of the items Ellen consumes daily:
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Let the cost of one carrot be \( c \) dollars. According to the problem, Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. Therefore, the total cost for her daily diet is:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 \]

We know that the total cost for her daily diet is $11. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 2c = 2 \]

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6. Since she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the payment for mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's lawn and the other lawns:
\[ 6x + 6x = 12x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 12x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 12x = 12 \times 1 = 12 \]

The earnings from lemonade sales is the total earnings minus the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 80 - 12 = 68 \]

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]
Solving for \( M \), we get:
\[ M = 7 - 5 = 2 \]
So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Consequently, Joseph had \( 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \) notebooks.

After buying 5 more notebooks, Martha now has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

  20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total material required for 8 large masks:
- Material for 8 large masks:
  \[
  8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks to find the total material required:
- Total material:
  \[
  10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
  \]

Thus, the total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is:
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ yards}}

"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies that Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8.

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

First, we sum up the time he spends on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours. Therefore, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue shoe boxes Tim has left after using 3 of them:

\[
9 \text{ red shoe boxes} - \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ red shoe boxes}\right) = 9 \text{ red shoe boxes} - 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}
\]

Now, we can sum the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:

\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes} + 6 \text{ red shoe boxes} = 10 \text{ shoe boxes}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
10

"First, we need to determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books that Sarah had, and Sarah had 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of books Joseph currently has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his 30 marbles to Jamie. 

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now, we calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[
6 \text{ (to Jamie)} + 10 \text{ (to Donald)} = 16
\]

Dean originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 16 marbles, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"First, we need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Let's calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Thus, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday, he completes:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby is paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, the total miles driven in a month is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups Jon needs for 3000 miles. Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we will calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Wednesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Thursday} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[
\text{Total hours} = \text{Hours on Tuesday} + \text{Hours on Wednesday} + \text{Hours on Thursday}
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours}

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount given to them by their mother is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

- Tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.
- Volleyball: There are twice the number of students playing tennis, so \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) students playing volleyball.
- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \( 16 + 22 = 38 \).

Next, we sum the number of students playing each sport to find the total number of students:

\[
6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56
\]

So, the total number of students is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, to find the total number of pets Larry has, we sum up the number of each type of pet:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Adding these together: \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of cups in each row is \( 2x \).

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that the total number of cups of tea is 27, and the remaining cups after dividing into rows are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups used in the rows is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

This means:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

So, there are 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea in each row. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into the tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

The time for one complete trip is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of trips he can make is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many berries he picks up per trip. Since he needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he makes 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2.
- Total spent on popcorn and candy = (2 * $8) + (4 * $2) = $16 + $8 = $24.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from his total monthly budget:
- Monthly budget = $150.
- Amount spent on popcorn and candy = $24.
- Remaining budget = $150 - $24 = $126.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. We know that tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, and tickets for other days cost $7 each. Since it is a Friday, he can only see a movie for $7.

Let's calculate how many movies he can see with the remaining $126:
- Number of movies he can see = Remaining budget / Cost per movie = $126 / $7 = 18 movies.

Therefore, the number of additional movies Colby can see is 18."
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys Sophie has for her nephew.

The total number of other toys is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys for her nephew. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean by \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Q + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Q = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Q + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[
Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[

"First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet:

\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the total distance both of them spit their seeds combined:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):

- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in revenue: \(\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800\)

So, Fern will make \(\$64800\) more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for each type of animal.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Therefore, for 15 goats, the total amount of hay required is:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of hay required for each sheep. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
Thus, each sheep needs:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
For 12 sheep, the total amount of hay required is:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts of hay required for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay needed:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money after this expense is:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract this amount from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to buy 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled out by Craig and his brother, we start by calculating the total number of letters Craig has spelled out.

Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters spelled out by Craig's brother. According to the problem, Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters spelled out by Craig's brother is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the two totals together:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the product of the number of children in each row and the number of rows for each school.

First, we know that there are 8 children in each row. Since there are 7 rows for each school, the number of children in one school is:
\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \]

Next, since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 56 \times 5 = 280 \]

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her 9 coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[
9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the 29 students. Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[
29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has after redeeming the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[
900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
\]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}
\]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour to ensure Patty gets paid for the full hour. Thus, the labor cost is for 3 hours.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, let's calculate the labor cost:
\[ \text{Labor cost} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we add all the components together:
\[ \text{Total charge} = \text{Visit fee} + \text{Labor cost} + \text{Parts cost} \]
\[ \text{Total charge} = \$40 + \$105 + \$60 = \$205 \]

So, Patty charged a total of **$205**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he sells these 5 CDs for $40, he loses:

\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money he was out is the cost of the 5 CDs he doesn't like, which is $35. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
\[ 6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9 \]

For the sweet potatoes:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20 \]

For the carrots:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5 \]

Now, we sum up the earnings from each type of root crop:
\[ \$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34 \]

So, Jen will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The remaining distance is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed, which is:
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming, the rest time, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread the bakery had based on the information given.

We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times (\text{Sam's loaves}) - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Then subtract 40:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so she has \(15 - 7 = 8\) stickers left. Then she receives 5 more stickers, so she has \(8 + 5 = 13\) stickers in total.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, summing up the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.

"To find Leo's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem with algebraic equations.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, we substitute Deanna's age into the second equation to find Marcus's age:
\[ M = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now we know Marcus is 21 years old. Using the first equation, we can find Leo's age:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To solve for \( L \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45
\]
\[
3A + 30 = 45
\]
Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3A = 15
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
A = 5
\]
So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

- For every inch, there are 100 pages.

First, we calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time she was sleepwalking:**
   - She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up earlier:**
   - She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at \( 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \).

4. **Calculate the total time she was awake:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \( 7 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Converting this to minutes: \( 7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Calculate the total time she was not on her bed:**
   - This includes the time she was sleepwalking (23 minutes) and the time she was awake (475 minutes).
   - Total time not on her bed: \( 23 \text{ minutes} + 475 \text{ minutes} = 498 \text{ minutes} \).

6. **Calculate the actual time she slept on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time: 480 minutes.
   - Time not on her bed: 498 minutes.
   - Since the time she was not on her bed exceeds the total sleep time, it indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, if we consider the usual sleep duration and the time she was awake, the time she slept on her bed is the usual sleep duration minus the time she was awake.

Given the usual sleep duration and the time she was awake, the time she slept on her bed is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 475 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to:

\[2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups}\]

Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he initially has is:

\[\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}\]

Next, we need to account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro. After giving away 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons}\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups, so the total number of utensils is:

\[24 + 10 = 34\]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we need to account for the additional patients admitted due to the coronavirus outbreak. The hospital admits 50 new patients each day. Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Total new patients} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these new patients to the initial number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of family emails is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after accounting for the work emails and the family emails. The number of non-work emails after subtracting the family emails is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of boyfriend emails is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. If Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the problem, Courtney's reported number is 120% of the actual number (100% + 20% overstatement). This can be written as:

\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Perform the division:

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \( 40 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Use the information about the number of holes at the end of the fourth day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the third day was 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than what Amora and Lainey received. Therefore, Collins received:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation:

\[
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
\]

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\[
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. Let's verify the solution:

- Adelwolfe caught \( A = 40 \) Pokemon.
- Stan caught \( S = 147 \) Pokemon.
- Alex caught \( X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152 \) Pokemon.

Summing these up:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the length of each episode.
2. Determine the number of episodes based on the given relationship.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching the show.

Given:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

First, let's denote the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes.

Next, we need to find the number of episodes, \( E \). The problem states that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore:
\[
E = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[
\text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:
\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"First, let's convert the quantities of brownies into individual pieces. Each brownie is considered as one piece.

Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
1 dozen = 12 brownies.

At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
1/2 dozen = 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies.
4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Total brownies initially:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

Total brownies eaten:
18 brownies.

Therefore, the number of brownies left over:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals to \(2 + 2 = 4\) boxes.

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in the boxes she kept:
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of oranges in the 8 boxes is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many oranges she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \]

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number she kept:
\[ 160 - 40 = 120 \]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

First, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When Emil turns 24, the number of years that will have passed is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

At that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \). According to the problem, at that time Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that at that time Emil will be 24, and he will be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother's age at that time will be:
\[ \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]
Since that will be 5 years from now, his brother's current age is:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 43 + 7 = 50 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the plant width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between every plant. Since 1.5 feet is equivalent to 18 inches, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 1332 inches of the flower bed.

Let's denote the number of plants as \( n \). The total space occupied by the plants and the spaces between them can be expressed as:

\[ 12n + 18(n-1) = 1332 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 12n + 18n - 18 = 1332 \]
\[ 30n - 18 = 1332 \]
\[ 30n = 1350 \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 plants to fill the flower bed. Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed. The final numerical answer is:

- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines for one basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used by the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used by the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations combined:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil available for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:

"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so with $500.00 saved each month, the number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:

\[ \text{Pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Emily spends peeling the shrimp and the time she spends sautéing the shrimp separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to sauté 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent peeling and the time spent sautéing to get the total time:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total temperature change: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 4 degrees during this period. Therefore, the net temperature change is:
- Net temperature change: \(14 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 10 \text{ degrees}\)

The room will be 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
\[ \text{Age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the second time 75 years after he saw it for the first time. Therefore, we can determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:
\[ \text{Age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time} = 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill Check**: He writes a check for the gas bill once per month. So, he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church Check**: He writes a check to the church twice per month. Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: He writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) for pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \]

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day. Since the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \), we substitute \( F = 88 \) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert Seconds to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Convert 120 seconds to minutes:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his mother and father from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.

Let the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred be \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We know:
- \( A = 3 \)
- \( B = 4 \)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \). Therefore, \( H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

Now we substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 \]
\[ 17 + W = 20 \]
\[ W = 20 - 17 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times this amount:

- Amount donated by the lawyer: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and how the slices are distributed based on the given ratio.

Let's denote the total number of slices of the watermelon as \( S \).

Given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can say that the 2 adults together get slices that are equivalent to 4 slices of the kids. This means that the 4 kids together get slices that are equivalent to 2 slices of the adults.

So, the total number of ""adult equivalent"" slices is 2 (from the adults) and the total number of ""kid equivalent"" slices is 4 (from the kids).

This means that the watermelon is divided into 6 ""adult equivalent"" slices (2 from adults and 4 from kids, but counted in terms of adult equivalents).

Each adult gets 2 ""adult equivalent"" slices out of the total 6 ""adult equivalent"" slices. Therefore, each adult gets \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\) of the watermelon.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33.33\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
33.33

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

We also need to convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. She wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ \boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}} \]"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions per month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[
\frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[
\frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes:
\[
16 - 8 = 8
\]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the number of gallons \( G \) needed is:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. **Yellow Sticks**: There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color:
\[ 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Number of students over 16 years old = \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Number of students under 16 years old = \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Number of male students over 16 years old = \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students over 16 years old are female.
   - Number of female students over 16 years old = \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \)

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Number of male students under 16 years old = \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students under 16 years old are female.
   - Number of female students under 16 years old = \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - Sum of female students over 16 years old and female students under 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

**Total water pumped on the first day:**
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

**Total water pumped on the second day:**
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

**Total water pumped over the two days:**
\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6000 \]"
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we consider the first 5 hours when the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. After 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as follows:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour. The charge remaining after the first 5 hours is \( C \times (0.91)^5 \). After the next 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 \approx 0.28 \]

This calculation shows that the initial charge \( C \) must be adjusted to fit the given final charge. Since the calculation shows that the initial charge \( C \) should be scaled to match the final charge of 28%, we can conclude:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.523 \) or 52.3%. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.3\%} \]"
"First, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is 20% of $10000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches is \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars.
- The cost of 4 pears is \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 kiwis is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 apples is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars.

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount of money he has left to spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars.

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[
15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs}
\]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of pieces in the 13 packs by 10:

\[
\frac{13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack}}{10 \text{ friends}} = \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend}
\]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating growth over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Albums**: She divided these pictures into 8 albums.
3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 albums were for selfies only.
   - 2 albums were for portraits only.
   - The remaining albums were for other categories.

First, calculate the number of albums that were not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Next, we know that the 3 albums for other categories were equally distributed among selfies and portraits. Since there are 3 albums for other categories, and they are split equally between selfies and portraits:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ other albums}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ selfies albums} \]
\[ \frac{3 \text{ other albums}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ portraits albums} \]

However, since the number of albums must be whole numbers, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the distribution:

Given the total number of pictures (72) and the distribution of albums:
- 3 albums for selfies: \(3 \times x = 3x\) selfies
- 2 albums for portraits: \(2 \times y = 2y\) portraits
- Remaining 3 albums for other categories: \(3 \times z = 3z\) other categories

Since the total number of pictures is 72:
\[ 3x + 2y + 3z = 72 \]

Given the albums are split equally between selfies and portraits:
\[ 3x = 2y \]

Solving for \(x\) and \(y\):
\[ x = \frac{2y}{3} \]

Since \(x\) and \(y\) must be whole numbers, let's test values:
If \(y = 3\):
\[ x = \frac{2 \times 3}{3} = 2 \]

So, the number of selfies and portraits:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ selfies} \]
\[ 2y = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ portraits} \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages he reads:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   So, after the early checkouts, there are 76 guests remaining.

3. **Guests who checked out late:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   So, after the late checkouts, there are 61 guests remaining.

4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in.

5. **Total guests after the afternoon check-ins:**
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   So, after the afternoon check-ins, there are 91 guests.

6. **Guests who checked in after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]
   So, after the additional check-ins, there are 98 guests.

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{number of large animals sold} \times \text{price of a large animal}) + (\text{number of small animals sold} \times \text{price of a small animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \). Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.

**Step 1: Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.**

- One dwarf with a bare hand mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
- One dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines twice as much as one dwarf with a bare hand, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than one dwarf with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.**

- One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.
- Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine \(36 \times 40 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

**Step 3: Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.**

- There are 30 days in the month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( P \).

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the third package with 8 sandwiches, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{P}{8} \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package should be the same as the price per sandwich for the first and second packages. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{P}{8} = 1.5
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 8:
\[
P = 1.5 \times 8 = 12
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Initially, there are 25 red balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of them to burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released. Initially, there are 12 yellow balloons. Sally accidentally released half of them:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue added)} = 35 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40.
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60.
   - Probability of convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20.
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80.

Now, we calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework in each scenario:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50.

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60.
  - Probability of convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20.
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80.
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: \(0.60 + 0.80 = 1.40\) or 140%.

Now, we combine the probabilities of both scenarios:

- Probability of having to turn in the homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50.
- Probability of having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario: 140% or 1.40.

Since these scenarios are mutually exclusive, we add their probabilities:

\[ 0.50 + 1.40 = 1.90 \]

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950 and for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends listening to the court case. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's determine her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find her net earnings after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time is the number of intervals multiplied by the time per interval:
     \[
     7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars per pound} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds.

\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he received $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income before and after college. Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job. After college, his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and instead worked the same number of years. If he had worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would be:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

Additionally, he would have missed out on working for 4 years, so the total income he lost is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

So, the total amount of money he lost is the sum of the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school:

\[ \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount of money he needs to earn by his annual income after college:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
   - Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
   - Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

2. Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
   - Area = Length × Width = \(8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\)

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
   - Total area = \(80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet}\)

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.**

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.

First, calculate one-fifth of the Monday's deliveries:
\[
\frac{425}{5} = 85
\]

Then, add 17 to this amount:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 102.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then, add 5 to this amount:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 209.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.**

Add the number of letters delivered on each day:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{736}

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to this, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars. Therefore, he did not lose any money in the second race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, we sum up the losses:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won $11)
- Third race: $16.5

Total loss = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17

- Number of people in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 26 \times 5 = 130 \]
\[ 130 \times 1000 = 130000 \]

So, the total population in South America is 130,000 people.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days they worked is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, each painter put in \(1.96875\) hours of work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
1.96875

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms again:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year to the initial price of $20,000. The depreciation can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the price of the car at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Here, \( P_0 = 20000 \), \( r = 0.21 \), and \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

So,

\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:

\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after an accident, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 to get the annual cost.

The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, we calculate the increased amount as follows:

\[ \text{Increased cost} = \text{Normal cost} \times \text{Percentage increase} \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times 0.60 \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is the normal cost plus the increased cost:

\[ \text{New monthly cost} = \text{Normal cost} + \text{Increased cost} \]
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 \]
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = \text{New monthly cost} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."

   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of loads for the king size bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

So, the amount of cat food one cat consumes per day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all cats per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To determine the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we start by defining the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices. We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

\[ J + 3 = 10 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices. Substituting the value of \( J \):

\[ 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, Silvia ate 14 slices. Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks.

First, we know that Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures:
\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[
\text{Number of trucks that delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]
Each truck that successfully delivered carried 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \) of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- For the first 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the next 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the last 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.

Since the promotion applies to every 2 pounds, Dennis will pay for 3 sets of 2 pounds:
- Cost for the first 2 pounds: \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)
- Cost for the next 2 pounds: \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)
- Cost for the last 2 pounds: \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

Adding these costs together:
\[ \$8.00 + \$8.00 + \$8.00 = \$24.00 \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. 

To find the additional fee, we calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The additional fee for these 21 guests is:

- Additional fee = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the additional fee to get the total cost:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the total cost for the party is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is \( 85 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day and then find out how many bananas the third monkey eats.

1. Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey in a day:
   The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

2. Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey in a day:
   The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

3. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day:
   The first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas, so together they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas each day.

4. Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a day:
   The total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, which is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is \(\frac{315}{7} = 45\) bananas. Since the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas in a day, the third monkey must eat the remaining bananas:
   \[
   45 - 24 = 21
   \]
   So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]"

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each and she bought 15 roses, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5. This means she will receive $5 in change. Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:
\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - Departure time: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time.
   - Time stayed in the station: \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Arrival time: 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Departure time: 65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Arrival time: 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Departure time: 125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes.
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine the time Paul will wait for his train. Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes. We need to find out when the third train arrives, which is at 125 minutes. The time Paul waits is the difference between the time he boards the fourth train and the time the third train arrives.

\[
\text{Time Paul waits} = 145 \text{ minutes} - 125 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[
10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[
200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[
\frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so:
\[ B = 90 \]

Frankie's score, \( F \), is described as 15 points more than twice Binkie's score. This can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Now, substitute Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Calculate the value:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total distance James walked:**
   - The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
   - He walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - Then he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance he walked is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - The total distance he walked is 4 miles.
   - Time taken is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour.

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}

   - **Trekking bikes:** Half of the total bikes sold are Trekking bikes.
     \[
     \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]
   - **BMX bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold are BMX bikes.
     \[
     \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
     \]
   - **MTB bikes:** The rest of the bikes sold are MTB bikes.
     \[
     \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
     \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - **Trekking bikes:** Each Trekking bike is sold for $450.
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
     \]
   - **BMX bikes:** Each BMX bike is sold for half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250.
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors ate was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

According to the problem, the lazy Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas, with 3 of them shaken and 9 unshaken.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, there are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{33.33\%}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
   - Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Sum the distances to find the total distance between the two trains:**
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

The time \( t_1 \) to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_1 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

The time \( t_2 \) to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_2 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = t_1 - t_2 = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to first calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks per day, and then multiply by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long. So, the total time per day is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour per day on his lunches and breaks.

After 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the discount.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the discount.
5. Add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance.
6. The final result will be the new balance on her credit card.

Let's go through each step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of the frying pan after a 20% discount: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - ($20.00 * 0.20) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels after a 10% discount: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - ($30.00 * 0.10) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough money for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = \$20,000 \).

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = \$40,000 \).

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:
- She needs to save $40,000 per year for 20 years.
- Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is \( 40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000 \).

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Thus, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough money for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts is 5 cm long.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the additional miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the additional miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.**
To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we need to compare the total miles she plans to hike per day with the total miles she plans to hike in June:
\[ \text{Total miles per day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]
\[ \text{Total miles in June} = 9,300 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total miles per day needed} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, the additional miles per day Soledad must hike is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, let's account for the additional fish Tate buys.

**Additional fish:**
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase.

**Total counts after purchase:**
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

**Total number of female fish:**
\[ 8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16 \]

Finally, we determine how many more female fish there are than male fish.

**Difference:**
\[ 16 \text{ (female fish)} - 11 \text{ (male fish)} = 5 \]

Thus, Tate has \(\boxed{5}\) more female fish than male fish."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took Amalia 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time: \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than 4 hours plus some additional time.
   - Let's denote the additional time Dior took over Amalia's time as \( x \) hours.
   - Therefore, Dior's time: \( 4 \text{ hours} + x \text{ hours} \).

Given that Dior took ""well over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume \( x \) is a positive number greater than 0. For simplicity, let's assume the minimum additional time Dior took is 5 hours (since ""well over"" implies more than 4 hours but not necessarily a large amount).

Thus, Dior's time: \( 4 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we sum up the total time taken by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\) hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month for his visits to his parents.

First, we need to find out the distance for a one-way trip. We know that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for a one-way trip:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is:

\[ \text{Total miles per month} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[
10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
\]

According to the problem, this distance (70 miles) is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
70 \text{ miles} = 2B
\]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys short of the order.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up the difference. The fifth worker needs to produce \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour. The final numerical answer is:

\[

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Let the number of eggs painted by Sarah be \( S \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted:
\[ S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]
So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

From the first piece of information, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2A = 26 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, the difference is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{12.5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since 80% of the tree can be turned into logs, we calculate:

\[ 80\% \times 80 = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet of logs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from 64 feet of logs:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If John sells each plank for $1.2, then the total revenue from selling 80 planks is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk and then sum these times.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write:
\[ v \times 40 = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. So her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on both segments to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks.

\[
4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[
60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save $28. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[
\frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[
7

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add up the birds from each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. After these actions, the water in the 33-degree mug is reduced to \( 4 \) ounces, and the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is still 33 degrees (since the temperature of the water doesn't change when it's poured).

The temperature of the water in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce into the water bottle is \( \frac{T}{4} \) degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces, and the total temperature of this water is \( 4 \times 33 + \frac{T}{4} \) degrees. Since Donny can now drink the water, the temperature of the water in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

\[ 4 \times 33 + \frac{T}{4} \geq 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:

\[ 132 + \frac{T}{4} \geq 40 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[ \frac{T}{4} \geq 40 - 132 \]

\[ \frac{T}{4} \geq -92 \]

Since the temperature cannot be negative, we need to ensure that the temperature of the second mug is such that the average temperature of the 5 ounces of water is at least 40 degrees. This means:

\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + \frac{T}{4}}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[ 4 \times 33 + \frac{T}{4} \geq 200 \]

\[ 132 + \frac{T}{4} \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[ \frac{T}{4} \geq 68 \]

Multiplying both sides by 4:

\[ T \geq 272 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 272 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{272} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added:
\[ 50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ added cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ 20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ added chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Russell orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 1 less than 3 as follows:

\[
3 - 1 = 2
\]

So, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require the same number of potatoes as 1 less than 3 scoops. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 3 less than 6 as follows:

\[
6 - 3 = 3
\]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first find out how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply by 3.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[
\frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
\]
Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:
\[
7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales. Each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the sunflowers sold from the individual sunflowers:
\[
84 + 13 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

To find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we first need to find the probability of winning for each ticket.

Given:
- The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as \( P(\text{winning first ticket}) = 0.20 \).
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket being a winner, assuming the events are independent. Thus, we calculate:
\[ P(\text{both tickets win}) = P(\text{winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{winning second ticket}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12. \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we find \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.

Now, we know Carl's height is 6 feet. According to the problem, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of one person, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
- For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Next, we determine how many more bottles are needed:
- The company currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The number of additional bottles needed is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the ratio of the number of purple-wearers wearing bows to the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.

\[
\text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

\[
\boxed{66.67}

"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of land sold in the first transaction.
2. Calculate the area of land sold in the second transaction.
3. Determine the area of land sold in the third transaction.
4. Calculate the total revenue from the first two transactions.
5. Calculate the revenue from the third transaction.
6. Sum up the total revenue.

Let's start with the first transaction:
- Abraham sold half of his land for $50.
- The area of land sold in the first transaction is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
- The price per square meter for the first transaction is \( \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \) dollars per square meter.

Next, the second transaction:
- Abraham sold \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his land for $30.
- The area of land sold in the second transaction is \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.
- The price per square meter for the second transaction is \( \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \) dollars per square meter.

Now, the third transaction:
- The remaining land is \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \) square meters.
- The price per square meter for the third transaction is $3.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
- Revenue from the first transaction: \( 40 \times 1.25 = 50 \) dollars.
- Revenue from the second transaction: \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) dollars.
- Revenue from the third transaction: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total revenue:
\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \]

So, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To find Geb's age, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

1. Let \( H \) be Haley's age.
2. Let \( G \) be Geb's age.

According to the problem, Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. This can be written as:
\[ G = \frac{1}{2}H - 10 \]

Given that Haley is 26 years old (\( H = 26 \)), we substitute \( H \) into the equation:
\[ G = \frac{1}{2}(26) - 10 \]

Now, we perform the calculation:
\[ G = 13 - 10 \]
\[ G = 3 \]

So, Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use \(2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ masks/day} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll find out how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. So, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week, so the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by each age of the tree and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced by each age of the tree:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is \( y - 7 \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4(y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37
\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
6y - 35 = 37
\]
Adding 35 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[
6y = 72
\]
Dividing both sides by 6, we find:
\[
y = 12
\]
Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[
y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ centimeters}
\]
And the length of the red rope is:
\[
4(y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ centimeters}
\]
So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's denote the initial amount of money given to Ronnie and Rissa as \( R \) and \( 3R \) respectively. According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie. So, if Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = $15 \).

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

2. **Determine the distribution of paint colors:**
   - There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
   - Half the mural is yellow.

3. **Set up the variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount of red paint in pints.
   Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( x \) pints, and the amount of purple paint is also \( x \) pints.

4. **Express the amount of yellow paint:**
   Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

5. **Set up the equation for the total amount of paint:**
   The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
   \[
   x + x + x + 6 = 12
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   3x + 6 = 12
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   3x = 6
   \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we sum up all the areas to find the total area of the house:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:

- **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. Since the special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we calculate the number of pods in the special size box as follows:

1. The regular box has 100 pods.
2. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which means it has \(100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

Next, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run with $1 if each cycle uses 1 pod. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the number of pods by the cost per pod:

3. The cost per pod is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.
4. With $1, you can run \(1 / 0.10 = 10\) cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle is 10.

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine the amount of chalk used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Since the chalk started as a 5-inch piece, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]
This means the teacher has:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]
of chalk left at the end of Monday.

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it. Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk. Let's denote the amount of chalk left at the end of day \( n \) as \( C_n \). Initially, \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches. The amount of chalk left after each day is:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n \times (1 - 0.20) = C_n \times 0.80 \]
We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches (since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches).

We can calculate the amount of chalk left each day:
\[ C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \]
\[ C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \]
\[ C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \]
\[ C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \]
\[ C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.89952 \]

Since \( C_5 = 0.89952 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days. Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. So, the amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the refund amount is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\]

So, each school receives $9,000. Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $9,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $9,000, we first determine how many sets of $500 are in $9,000:

\[
\frac{9000}{500} = 18
\]

Since each set of $500 allows him to buy 100 books, with $9,000 he can buy:

\[
18 \times 100 = 1800
\]

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the 1 apple on his head and the other apple that fell out, making a total of 2 apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
4. Now, Newton has 5 apples (the 2 he picked up plus the 3 that fell out). He picked up these 5 apples, put 4 in his pocket, and threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
5. Now, Newton has 11 apples (the 4 he put in his pocket plus the 7 that fell out). He picked up all of these 11 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 11.

\[
\boxed{11}

"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[
\boxed{306}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza that her friends eat.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \div 12 = 3\).
- Since 36 is exactly divisible by 12, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \div 8 = 3\).
- Since 24 is exactly divisible by 8, Kate needs 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine the total number of apple slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother, we can follow these steps:

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, we sum the slices eaten by each of them:
\[1 \text{ (Doxa)} + 2 \text{ (sister)} + 3 \text{ (brother)} = 6\]

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- At the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- At the end of the third day, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered on the third day:

- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages left from the order.
- Adding the bandages they had at the end of the second day, they had \(22 + 75 = 97\) bandages, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left.

Given the discrepancy, let's re-evaluate the initial bandages they started with. Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as \(x\).

From the first day:
- They used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had \(x - 38 + 50 = x + 12\) bandages at the end of the first day.

From the second day:
- They used 28 bandages, so they had \(x + 12 - 28 = x - 16\) bandages at the end of the second day.

From the third day:
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(x - 16 + 75 = x + 59\) bandages at the end of the third day.
- According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left, so \(x + 59 = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x + 59 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the haircut involved cutting:

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25 \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Days per week} = 11.25 \times 6 = 67.5 \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April and Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the additional $10 for each of the 4 weeks:
\[ \text{Additional earnings for the month} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for the month of April:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks} + \text{Additional earnings for the month} = 67.5 \times 4 + 40 = 270 + 40 = 310 \]

So, Jen will receive:

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once and earns $3.00 for each laundry task.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once and earns $1.50 for each cleaning task.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Taking the trash out**: Jason took the trash out twice and earns $0.75 for each trash-out task.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information given, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[
\text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[
\text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[
\boxed{1200}

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in after that.
   - Number of people who came in after 10:00 = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who came in by evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry after 10:00: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

2. Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Let's start with step 1:

- One-third of the fish have red stripes.
- Total number of fish = 66.
- Number of fish with red stripes = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22\).

Next, for step 2:

- Remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes = \(66 - 22 = 44\).

For step 3:

- 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
- Number of fish with blue stripes = \(\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20\).

Finally, for step 4:

- Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes.
- Total = \(22 + 20 = 42\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with 6 colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, the number of colors left after the theft is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. We know that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor itself, which is 240 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles walked by all four dogs. Finally, we can determine the miles walked by the last dog.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

First, we calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average distance walked by all four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance walked by all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we can find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk by subtracting the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]
   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.
   \[

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the problem, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November is $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

   So, the sum of the scores is 630.

2. **Count the scores**: There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:
\[ \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours/day}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50\% \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf and then the total capacity of the bookcases.

1. **Middle shelves capacity:**
   Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of middle shelves} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. **Bottom shelf capacity:**
   The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   \[
   \text{Capacity of bottom shelf} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. **Top shelf capacity:**
   The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   \[
   \text{Capacity of top shelf} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   Adding the capacities of all the shelves together.
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of one bookcase} = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases are needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase.
   \[
   \text{Number of bookcases} = \frac{110}{55} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement for both tests combined.

First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. To pass, she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly. The total number of questions across both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in total to pass, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

This means Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total to pass. Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is given by the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \). The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms.
- Therefore, the number of flashlights for the rooms is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
- Adding the flashlights for the people, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- In these 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights used, we add the total number of flashlights and the total number of candles:
\[20 + 36 = 56\]

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. Since half of the 200 yards is on land and the other half is in water, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{hop}} \) can be calculated as:
\[
t_{\text{hop}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His speed in water is 10 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{swim}} \) can be calculated as:
\[
t_{\text{swim}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time \( t_{\text{total}} \) for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{hop}} + t_{\text{swim}} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach over the week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then find the total.

First, let's find the number of people on each day:
- On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
- On the second day, the number of people was 20 more than on the first day, so:
  \[
  50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
  \]
- On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so:
  \[
  2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
  \]

Let's denote the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people seen over the week is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is:
\[
60 \times 7 = 420
\]
The total number of people seen over the first three days is:
\[
50 + 70 + 140 = 260
\]
Let the total number of people seen on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days be \( 4x + 5x + 6x = 15x \). The total number of people seen over the week is the sum of the people seen over the first three days and the people seen over the last three days:
\[
260 + 15x = 420
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
15x = 420 - 260
\]
\[
15x = 160
\]
\[
x = \frac{160}{15} = \frac{32}{3}
\]
The total number of people seen on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is:
\[
4x + 5x + 6x = 15x = 15 \times \frac{32}{3} = 160

- The total number of blocks is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + r \text{ (red)} = 32 \]

Now, we can solve for \( r \):
\[ 4 + 8 + r = 32 \]
\[ 12 + r = 32 \]
\[ r = 32 - 12 \]
\[ r = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each direction and then determine the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from Elvis's starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the value after each year's depreciation step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - The value after the first year is \( 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year, which is $6300.
   - The value after the second year is \( 6300 \times (1 - 0.30) = 6300 \times 0.70 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year, which is $4410.
   - The value after the third year is \( 4410 \times (1 - 0.20) = 4410 \times 0.80 = 3528 \).

So, the boat is worth **$3528** after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Number of pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)

Let's calculate the sum of red, orange, and yellow candies:
54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

So, the number of pink candies is 43.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the total cost for both the hotel and the bus rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for the bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, the cost for one bus trip is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]
Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost for the bus rides is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Now, we add the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total original price for 2 T-shirts is \(2 \times 8 = $16\).
- The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, so for every two T-shirts, the first one is at full price and the second one is at 50% off.
- The first T-shirt costs $8.
- The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs \(8 \times 0.5 = $4\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 2 T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = $12\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is \(40 \times 0.40 = $16\).
- The final price of the shoes after the discount is \(40 - 16 = $24\).

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:

"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00
\]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the $40:

\[
40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for:

\[ 7 \text{ days/week} - 2 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ days/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To determine the final number of cookies Randy has, we will follow the sequence of events and update the count of each type of cookie accordingly.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **After eating 3 cookies for an early day snack (one of each flavor):**
   - Oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
   - Sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

3. **After eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: \(8 - 2 = 6\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: \(3\) (unchanged)
   - Sugar cookies: \(4\) (unchanged)

4. **After giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: \(6\) (unchanged)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: \(3\) (unchanged)
   - Sugar cookies: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

5. **After baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
   - Sugar cookies: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

Now, we sum the final counts of each type of cookie to find the total number of cookies Randy has:

\[
10 \text{ (oatmeal)} + 7 \text{ (chocolate chip)} + 6 \text{ (sugar)} = 23
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has a total of 12 toy soldiers. Half of his collection is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \]

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first 6 toy soldiers. Therefore, the earnings from the first 6 toy soldiers are:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The other half of his collection is also 6 toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy for these 6 toy soldiers. Therefore, the earnings from the other 6 toy soldiers are:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both parts of his collection:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over the period Nate is away and then determine how long it takes to fill in all the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug = \(6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\).

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over the period Nate is away:
- Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day, but Nate fills in 9 holes per day.
- Net change per day = \(9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of days it takes to fill in all the holes:
- Total holes dug = 84 holes.
- Net change per day = 3 holes/day.
- Total days to fill in all holes = \(\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}\).

Finally, we convert the total days into weeks:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total weeks = \(\frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}\).

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
1000
\]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595 and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075. So, we perform the following subtraction:

\[ 7995 - 2595 - 3075 \]

First, subtract the number of rainbow cookies from the total:

\[ 7995 - 2595 = 5400 \]

Next, subtract the number of oatmeal cookies from the result:

\[ 5400 - 3075 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\)
- Petri dishes: \(14 + 2 = 16\)
- Beakers: 7 (correct number)

The total number of items Igor had initially was:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + 7 \text{ (beakers)} = 31 \text{ items} \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \text{ items} \]

Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers (7), the lost items must be from the test tubes and Petri dishes. We already know he gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, which totals 24 items. Since he lost 2 items, and these items must be from the 24 items he gathered, the only way to lose 2 items and still have 29 items on the lab bench is if he lost 2 test tubes.

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket.

1. The first basket contains 10 eggs.
2. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by all of them is:
\[
\boxed{2180}

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:
\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, we have:
\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so the distance Vanessa ran, \( D_V \), is:
\[ D_V = 2 \times D_A = 2 \times (A \times 16) = 32A \]

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ 32A = 4 \]
\[ A = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since \( A = 2V \), we can find \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{A}{2} = \frac{1/8}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. The time \( T_V \) it took Vanessa to run 4 miles is:
\[ T_V = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Vanessa's speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed for the dock:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the line the caretaker already has:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line he already has from the total line required:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of reservations per night:**
   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.

2. **Determine the number of reservations per day:**
   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   Multiply the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of James, Dora, and John's youngest son in the future, specifically in 3 years.

First, let's determine Dora's current age. We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Next, we know that James is now twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is currently 9 years old, James is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since James is currently 18, we can determine John's current age:
\[ 32 + 18 = 50 \]

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his current age is:
\[ 50 - 32 = 18 \]

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \). We know from the problem that:

1. The total number of animals is 20, so we have the equation:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, and the total number of legs is 70, so we have the equation:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the 56 slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
