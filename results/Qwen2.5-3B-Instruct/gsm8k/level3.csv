Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs. The number of eggs left after these actions is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount of money she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber used for the robe.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
\[ 3 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, and this increases the value of the house by 150%.

The increase in value is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of the repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total meters run per sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters per sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters run per week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so the total meters run per week for one sprint is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters run per week for all sprints:**

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning feed: 15 cups
   - Afternoon feed: 25 cups
   - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups

2. **Determine the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock:**
   - Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens.
   - Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Total feed needed for the flock: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups

3. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total feed needed for the flock: 60 cups
   - Feed given in the morning and afternoon: 40 cups
   - Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost for every second glass:
- The cost of every second glass is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (since every second glass is the one that costs $3):
- The cost for 8 pairs of glasses is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 8 glasses (the first glass in each pair):
- The cost for these 8 glasses is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[24 + 40 = 64\]

So, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for the 16 glasses."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}

Total download time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Since John started 180 miles away from home and has traveled 475 miles, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[475 \text{ miles} - 180 \text{ miles} = 295 \text{ miles}\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[295\]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Earnings for regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * regular rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour.
   - Earnings for overtime hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings for regular hours + Earnings for overtime hours.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."

   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find when this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = 10.5 - 93 = -82.5 \]

Since the net profit is negative each year, Carlos will never start earning money on the lemon tree. The tree will always incur a loss.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{never}}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x \) left after the green house.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left after the red house.
3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left after the orange house.
4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10 \]

Next, add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 12 \]

Then, multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \) to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by working backwards through the problem:

1. She started with 18 vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 18, which is 6, so she had \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) left.
3. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she had \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) left.
4. She sold half of what was left, which is half of 10, so she sold 5, and she had \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) left.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is indeed 5, our solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates and then compare the profit from each plan.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Finally, we sum up her annual teaching and coaching earnings to get her total annual salary.

Let's do the calculations:

Annual teaching earnings = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Annual coaching earnings = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.
2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.
3. Determine the amount of water in the remaining orange drink after spilling one liter.
4. Add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to get the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the remaining orange drink after spilling one liter.**

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]
Since the orange drink is still two-thirds water, the amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:
\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to get the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink.**

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since a 25% discount means the customer pays 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the unknown quantity of boxes of pizza.

First, let's list out the costs of the items Marie ordered:
- One chicken meal costs $12.
- Five packs of milk, each costing $3, cost \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Four apples, each costing $1.50, cost \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.
- Let \(x\) be the number of boxes of pizza. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza is \(8.50x\).

The total amount Marie paid is $50. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50\]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \(x\):
\[33 + 8.50x = 50\]
\[8.50x = 50 - 33\]
\[8.50x = 17\]
\[x = \frac{17}{8.50}\]
\[x = 2\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"

- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{243}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance of the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance of the second stop: 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles, the second stop is at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.
4. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops: \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the time spent per day:**
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per day is:
     \[
     10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Determine the time spent per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"

   - We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. **Determine how many jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

So, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add that to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, he scored 1 more point than he did in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, the points he scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points from both 20-minute periods to get the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate how many sets of 4 yogurts he needs to buy to meet that requirement.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy.**

Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games to the remaining money.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We can verify that the total amount of money John had initially (from selling the lego sets) is indeed $195, and he spent $165, leaving him with $5.

Since John sold all 13 lego sets and did not sell any more, he still has 13 lego sets.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days a week. The first day he runs for 3 hours, and the other two days he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know the total distance (60 miles) and the total time (6 hours). Speed is calculated as distance divided by time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of making the candles:**
   - Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles.
   - For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He sells 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \(40 - 20 = 20\) dollars.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) post-it notes. She then used some of these to place one on each of 220 different cups of coffee, leaving her with 23 post-it notes remaining. This can be represented by the equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we add 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( 163 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

\[ \text{Number of kittens Patchy has had} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens Patchy has had:
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 7 + 21 = 28 \]
\[ 28 + 12 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. We know the following:

1. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
3. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

First, we calculate the maximum additional weight the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's limit. This is done by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this additional weight capacity. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

First, we calculate the delivery fee added to the original bill:
\[ \text{Original bill} = \$40.00 \]
\[ \text{Delivery fee} = \$3.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the original bill:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee} = \$40.00 + \$3.00 = \$43.00 \]

Next, we add the tip to the bill after the delivery fee:
\[ \text{Tip} = \$4.00 \]
\[ \text{Final bill} = \$43.00 + \$4.00 = \$47.00 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:

"To find out how many oranges are good, we need to first determine the number of unripe oranges and then subtract them from the total, along with the bad oranges.

Given:
- Total oranges = 25
- Bad oranges = 1
- Unripe oranges = 20% of total oranges

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ \text{Unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, we know there are 1 bad orange, 5 unripe oranges, and the rest are good. So, the number of good oranges is:
\[ \text{Good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - (\text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5) = 25 - 6 = 19 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 19.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of the jeweler is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the brooch to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1430 \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives the full pension amount of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years (years 21 to 30):**
   - Starting from year 21, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of year 21 is $1,000,000.
   - Annual pension for the next 10 years = 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, her pension for the remaining 10 years will be the 5% of the value of the pension at the start of year 21, which is $50,000 per year.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50000}

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The initial amount is $140.
   - The reduced amount per month is:
     \[
     140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Adding the costs from both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the miles per gallon (mpg) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the full tank of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas and she can drive 25 miles per gallon, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's determine the number of each type of gem:

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Next, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:

\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

Thus, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys at the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.

First, we know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

We are also given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So, the number of teachers is:

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Bailey started with. She receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount of money she receives over the 8 weeks is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level (level 4) as \( a_4 = 16 \).

The square footage of the third level (level 3) will be:
\[ a_3 = \frac{a_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

The square footage of the second level (level 2) will be:
\[ a_2 = \frac{a_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

The square footage of the first level (level 1) will be:
\[ a_1 = \frac{a_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2
- Level 2: 4
- Level 3: 8
- Level 4: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4}{4} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food needed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15.

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the total potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we sum the number of pets each has:
\[ 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( M \)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

Since we know James's age is 10, we can substitute \( M = 10 \) into the fourth equation to find Corey's age:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age is 11, we can substitute \( C = 11 \) into the second equation to find Amy's age:
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. We can substitute \( A = 9 \) into the first equation to find Jackson's age:
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement:**
   Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time. We can calculate his new time as follows:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we will set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( D \) be the number of dogs.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cats.
- Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of dogs \( D \) is 60.
2. The number of cats \( C \) is two times the number of dogs \( D \), so \( C = 2D \).
3. The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, substitute the value of \( D \) into the equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120. \]

Next, substitute the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial volume of tomatoes before they were cooked, and then calculate the number of tomatoes used.

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Initial volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16 ounce cans were used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16 ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary receives 18 new potted plants from her nursery:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

**Weekdays:**
- John drinks 1 glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).
- He also drinks 1 glass of water before bed.
- Therefore, he drinks 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 glasses of water per weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is 3 glasses/day * 5 days = 15 glasses.

**Weekends:**
- On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- He does not drink water before bed on weekends.
- Therefore, he drinks 1 glass of water per day on the weekend.
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is 1 glass/day * 2 days = 2 glasses.

**Total for the week:**
- Adding the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends, we get 15 glasses + 2 glasses = 17 glasses.

"Let's break down the problem and set up the equations based on the information provided.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's say he watched \(x\) episodes. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which totals \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which totals \(2\) hours.

The total time he spent watching TV is 7 hours. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7\]
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]
\[0.5x = 7 - 5.5\]
\[0.5x = 1.5\]
\[x = \frac{1.5}{0.5}\]
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked \( x + 15 \) cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has \( (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \) cookies left. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Since the question does not specify the selling price per board, we assume she sells each board at the same price as she bought them, which is the same as the cost price (since the problem does not mention any change in price).

- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13 and the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, which is \(7x\):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

We know that:
\[ 40,000 = L \times 1.30 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = 30,769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago. So, his new salary is:
\[ 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from four years ago. So, her new salary is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total salary is:
\[ 99,076.92 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"
"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.
   - Therefore, the number of sheets used per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
     \]

2. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month.
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the number of sheets used per month is:
     \[
     60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
     \]

Thus, the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:

"First, let's determine the number of fruits each person brought.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples Morisette brought: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges Morisette brought: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total: \(5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits}\)
- Kael's total: \(10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits}\)

Next, we add the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:
\[ 13 \text{ fruits} + 14 \text{ fruits} = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

Thus, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(8 + 1 = 9\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Saturday, so she slept \(9 + 1 = 10\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]
\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \]
\[ 27 + 8 = 35 \]
\[ 35 + 9 = 44 \]
\[ 44 + 10 = 54 \]

So, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the remaining time after the first 3 hours:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining Time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

First, we know that Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters are now stamped and added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

We are also told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since 20 of these are the newly stamped letters, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Determine the cost of each pepper:**
   Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Determine the cost of each watermelon:**
   Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of each watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of each orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of each orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the watermelons:**
   Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, so the total cost for the watermelons is:
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

Let's start with the first step:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:

- Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = Miles on Monday + Miles on Tuesday = \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles.

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:

- Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles from Monday to Wednesday - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

So, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is 13 miles."

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \) (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. \( B = 2Q \) (There are twice as many baby bees as queens)
3. \( W + B + Q = 700 \) (The total number of bees is 700)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- From \( B = 2Q \), we get \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now we substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q = 700. \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now we can find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and calculate the tax on them. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The cost of light bulbs is $3 and the cost of roach traps is $4. The tax rate is 10%.

First, calculate the tax on the light bulbs:
\[ \text{Tax on light bulbs} = 3 \times \frac{10}{100} = 0.30 \]

Next, calculate the tax on the roach traps:
\[ \text{Tax on roach traps} = 4 \times \frac{10}{100} = 0.40 \]

Now, add the tax to the original cost of the light bulbs and the roach traps:
\[ \text{Total cost of light bulbs including tax} = 3 + 0.30 = 3.30 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of roach traps including tax} = 4 + 0.40 = 4.40 \]

The cost of the other items (milk, eggs, and cups) is $2, $3, and $3 respectively, and there is no tax on these items. So, the total cost of these items is:
\[ \text{Total cost of milk, eggs, and cups} = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \]

Finally, add the total costs of all items including tax:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest from one hectare in a year.
2. Multiply that number by the total number of hectares John has.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he harvests every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of harvests as follows:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, in one year, he can harvest:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive. We need to calculate the total number of bees that left before this last 6-hour period.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30
   - Bees that left in the next 6 hours: 60
   \[
   \text{Total bees that left before the last 6 hours} = 30 + 60 = 90
   \]
   Since all these bees return in the last 6 hours, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Bees returning} = 90
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how many friends James has on Facebook, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends.

Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as \( D \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ 3D = 12 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 friends. Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, if Dorothy has 4 friends, James has:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of Facebook friends James has is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their travel times is:
\(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve).

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total amount made:
- Total amount = $2.50 (bicycles) + $2.25 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) = $5.00.

So, Shawnda made **$5.00** that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Now, we determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \text{Change} = \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries to the initial number. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Final number of fries**: 5 fries.
2. **Raccoon**: The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. This means that the remaining fries after the raccoon stole some were one third of the remaining fries. Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole any as \( x \). After the raccoon stole two thirds, one third of \( x \) is 5 fries. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} x = 5 \implies x = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
   So, before the raccoon stole any fries, there were 15 fries.
3. **Pigeons**: Three pigeons each ate 3 fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \( 15 + 3 \times 3 = 15 + 9 = 24 \) fries.
4. **Dave and the seagull**: Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries. This means that before Dave and the seagull ate, there were \( 24 + 14 + 7 = 45 \) fries.
5. **Dave's initial fries**: Dave ate 14 fries, so the initial number of fries in the pack was 45.

Thus, the initial number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both sets of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends on classes in one week:
\[9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TuTh)} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly total by 16:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the lengths of the croissants and baguettes are given in inches, and the rolls are already in inches.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches = \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches = \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - First, convert feet to inches: \( 2 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches = \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana consumption for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is \(100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}\).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ yards}\).
- Kelly then runs this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}\).

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 + 6 - 2 = 15 \]

The final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

**Step 1: Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.**

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet.

\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.

\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"First, let's determine how many fish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Anakin's total:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Locsin's total:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Adding the totals together:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means the price after each two-month period is 120% (or 1.2 times) the price at the start of that period.

3. **Number of Periods**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
   \[
   \text{Number of periods} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Period**: The price after each period can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Price after } n \text{ periods} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.2)^n
   \]
   Here, \( n = 18 \).

5. **Substitute the Values**:
   \[
   \text{Price after 18 periods} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

7. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

Given:
- The cost of one red car is $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- An action figure costs $5.

First, let's find the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the cost of the doll is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the red cars:
- There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's find the cost of the action figures:
- There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of all the toys:
- The cost of the red cars is $20.
- The cost of the doll is $15.
- The cost of the action figures is $15.

So, the total value of all the toys is \(20 + 15 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, we know that each flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, \((S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28\).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( B \):
\[
(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
\]
\[
(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
\]
\[
3B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

\[ E = 8 \]
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

Now, substitute the value of \( E \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

First, let's calculate the miles he walks from Monday to Friday:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- He walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
- Total miles from Monday to Friday = 5 days * 20 miles/day = 100 miles.

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on the weekend:
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- He walks 10 miles each day on the weekend.
- Total miles on the weekend = 2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the jacket and the pants, and then sum these costs with the cost of the hat.

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The total cost of each uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."

"Let's denote the ages of the birds as follows:
- Sally Thirtytwo = S32
- Sally Four = S4
- Granny Red = G
- Sally Two = S2

From the problem, we know:
1. Sally Thirtytwo (S32) is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four (S4) is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so S4 = S32 = 8.
3. Granny Red (G) is two times as old as Sally Four, so G = 2 * S4 = 2 * 8 = 16.
4. Sally Two (S2) is three years older than Granny Red, so S2 = G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

The total age of the four birds is the sum of their ages:
\[ \text{Total age} = S32 + S4 + G + S2 = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 \]

The total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to find out the total minimum monthly payment and then calculate 50% more than that.

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Total Minimum Monthly Payment} = \$300 + \$200 + \$500 = \$1000 \]

Next, we calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ \text{50% More than Total Minimum Monthly Payment} = \$1000 + (0.5 \times \$1000) = \$1000 + \$500 = \$1500 \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the annualized monthly payment by 12:
\[ \text{Annual Payment} = \$1500 \times 12 = \$18000 \]

"To determine how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for consistency:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
- \( C \) as the total cost of making the lemonade.
- \( P \) as the total profit.

From the problem, we know:
1. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
2. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
3. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, and we know the profit is $25.

The cost \( C \) can be expressed as:
\[ C = 5x \]

The revenue \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = 10x \]

The profit \( P \) is given by:
\[ P = R - C \]
\[ 25 = 10x - 5x \]
\[ 25 = 5x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the total number of boys and girls on the Chinese team is 160, and the number of boys is 60. Therefore, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps involving fractions, percentages, and arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after donation to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). So, we have:
\[ B = 40 \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore, we can express Monic's crabs in terms of Bo's crabs:
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore, we can express Rani's crabs in terms of Monic's crabs:
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together. We sum the crabs of each:
\[ R + M + B = 46 + 36 + 40 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to add the earnings from each week.

For the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the second piece of information:
\[ 200 = 5w \]
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ w = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- \( J \) for Jean's current age,
- \( M \) for Mark's current age,
- \( A \) for Jan's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(A - 2) + 5
   \]
3. Jan is 30 years old.
   \[
   A = 30
   \]

First, substitute \( A = 30 \) into the second equation:
\[
M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2) + 5
\]
Simplify inside the parentheses:
\[
M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
\]
\[
M - 2 = 14 + 5
\]
\[
M - 2 = 19
\]
Add 2 to both sides to solve for \( M \):
\[
M = 21
\]

Now that we have Mark's current age, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
\[
J = M + 2
\]
Substitute \( M = 21 \):
\[
J = 21 + 2
\]
\[
J = 23
\]

Thus, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
- Difference = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and rolling two even numbers in a row.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"If Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate the term with \( r \):
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18 to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the simple interest formula:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Here, the principal (P) is $100, the monthly interest rate (R) is 2% or 0.02, and the time (T) is 3 months.

First, calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 = 6 \]

Then, add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost incurred by the trader. The cost of buying the wheat is \( 20x \) dollars, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2x \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ 30x \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the equation for the profit as:
\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on rides, so the total cost for all expenses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 36.00 + 33.00 = 69.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{69.00}{3} = 23.00 \]

So, each of them paid $23.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 23.00 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the net increase in trees each year:**
   - Tom plants 10 trees.
   - Tom chops down 2 trees.
   - Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

2. **Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years:**
   - Tom starts with 50 trees.
   - Over 10 years, the net increase in trees = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
   - Total number of trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

3. **Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years:**
   - 30% of the trees die.
   - Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Sum the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly payment.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

The total payment Mark makes in a week is the sum of the payments from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise. His original weekly salary is $2000. A 5% raise means his new weekly salary will be:

\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = \text{Original Weekly Salary} + (\text{Original Weekly Salary} \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 \]
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John makes in a year with his new weekly salary. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \text{New Weekly Salary} \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 2100 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 109200 \]

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that Mr. Bert will remove the lowest score from the average. We will first calculate the average of the five known scores and then determine the score needed on the sixth test to achieve the desired average.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. First, we find the sum of these scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

The average of these five scores is:
\[ \frac{438}{5} = 87.6 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores will be \( 438 + x \). The average of these six scores, after removing the lowest score, will be:
\[ \frac{438 + x - \text{lowest score}}{5} = 93 \]

To find the score \( x \) that Brinley needs, we need to consider the lowest score among the five known scores. The lowest score is 71. Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{438 + x - 71}{5} = 93 \]
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Thus, Brinley needs a score of 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week for the first four weeks = \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Total kilometers for the first four weeks = \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week for the next three weeks = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Total kilometers for the next three weeks = \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Total kilometers = Kilometers from the first four weeks + Kilometers from the next three weeks.
- Total kilometers = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2600 \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total after three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. **Tuesday**: She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \) dollars.
   - Twenty dozen cups is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     240x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

5. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     240x = 34800
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 240 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

6. **State the final numerical answer:**
   - The total cost of buying each cup is:
     \[
     \boxed{145}
     \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to have at least $70 after her initial $10 savings.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is her initial savings plus the money she earns from babysitting plus the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 20 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, we substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the second equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can find the number of white chickens:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Now, we check the total number of eggs:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking, we first need to determine the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now that we know the perimeter is 15 miles, we can calculate the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The formula for time \( t \) is:

\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of differential equations based on the rates at which the pools are being emptied and the initial conditions given.

Let's denote:
- \( B(t) \) as the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \) (in minutes).
- \( S(t) \) as the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \) (in minutes).

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we need to express the rates of change of the water in each pool. Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the differential equations are:
\[
\frac{dB}{dt} = -4
\]
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = -4
\]

Next, we use the initial conditions:
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This means at \( t = -4 \):
  \[
  B(-4) = 2S(-4)
  \]
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means at \( t = 0 \):
  \[
  B(0) = 4S(0)
  \]

We solve the differential equations:
\[
\frac{dB}{dt} = -4 \implies B(t) = -4t + C_1
\]
\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = -4 \implies S(t) = -4t + C_2
\]

Using the initial conditions:
1. At \( t = -4 \):
   \[
   B(-4) = -4(-4) + C_1 = 16 + C_1
   \]
   \[
   S(-4) = -4(-4) + C_2 = 16 + C_2
   \]
   Given \( B(-4) = 2S(-4) \):
   \[
   16 + C_1 = 2(16 + C_2) \implies 16 + C_1 = 32 + 2C_2 \implies C_1 = 16 + 2C_2
   \]

2. At \( t = 0 \):
   \[
   B(0) = -4(0) + C_1 = C_1
   \]
   \[
   S(0) = -4(0) + C_2 = C_2
   \]
   Given \( B(0) = 4S(0) \):
   \[
   C_1 = 4C_2
   \]

We now have two equations:
\[
C_1 = 16 + 2C_2
\]
\[
C_1 = 4C_2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( C_1 \):
\[
4C_2 = 16 + 2C_2 \implies 2C_2 = 16 \implies C_2 = 8
\]

Substituting \( C_2 = 8 \) back into \( C_1 = 4C_2 \):
\[
C_1 = 4(8) = 32
\]

Thus, the solutions for \( B(t) \) and \( S(t) \) are:
\[
B(t) = -4t + 32
\]
\[
S(t) = -4t + 8
\]

Now, we need to find the amount of water in the small pool now (at \( t = 0 \)):
\[
S(0) = -4(0) + 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return:**
   Janeth promised to return the principal amount plus an additional 10% of the principal amount.
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 2000 + 0.10 \times 2000 = 2000 + 200 = 2200
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:**
   Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months.
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 = 1980
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months:**
   Subtract the total payment from the total amount promised.
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220
   \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be \(\boxed{220}\)."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine the number of dahlias in the vase. According to the problem, there are 7 more dahlias than roses.
   \[
   \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias.
   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15
   \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their ages in three years. Finally, we will calculate the average age of the three individuals at that time.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63
   \]

3. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Adrian's age in three years: 
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66
     \]
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Let's denote Jojo's score by \( J \). The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"First, we need to determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters for her garden.

The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. After using 90 liters, the remaining amount of water is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount that is left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank now:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the number of cards of each type changes as follows:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (unchanged) + 14 (new) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

So, the total number of cards James has now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

"To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his burrito and then subtract the value of his gift card.

First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 sauces cost $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

So, the total cost of the burrito with all the additions is $11.00.

Next, Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which adds chips and a drink. Adding this to the total:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at checkout. Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we first need to calculate their combined work rate in pieces per minute.

Kalinda's work rate is 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom's work rate is half of Kalinda's, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined work rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since we need the final answer in hours, we convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and were taken home by Ashlyn. This means the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and were taken home by Ashlyn. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Mark also has to pay $1000 for registration on each car. Since he has 12 cars, the total registration fee is:

\[ \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fee to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, Kylie collected:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells on Monday} \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Since she collected 25 shells on Monday, the number of shells she collected on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave. We know there are 36 penguins in total.

First, we calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we find out how many penguins are left by subtracting the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's daily intake} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total daily intake of tomatoes by Steve and his girlfriend together:

\[ \text{Total daily intake} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Total weekly intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can determine the number of vines needed by dividing the total weekly intake by the weekly production of one vine:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order:
\[ \boxed{10} \text{ pizzas} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram starts with 25 pens. He will use these 25 pens to make new pens until he no longer has enough empty pens to make any more new pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we need to determine how many sets of five empty pens he can get from his initial 25 pens.

We divide the total number of pens by the number of pens needed to make one new pen:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

This calculation shows that Ram can make 5 new pens from his initial 25 pens. After making these 5 new pens, he will have used up all 25 of his original pens, and he will have 5 new pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Ram has now is:
\[ 25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram has is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Johnny had after adding the extra $10 to his $20 allowance.

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each girl based on the information given.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Adding these together:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
\[

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
4. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit B, which will be the number of students who went out through exit C.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of students who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Number of students remaining after exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Number of students who went out through exit B:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of the remaining students} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. **Number of students remaining after exit B, which is the number who went out through exit C:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of candies Robert has, then find out how many candies James has, and finally calculate how many more candies John has than James.

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) candies.

2. **Determine the number of candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.

3. **Calculate how many more candies John has than James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - Therefore, John has \( 54 - 33 = 21 \) more candies than James.

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
\[3 \text{ (Dolly's books read)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's books read)} = 6 \text{ books}\]

Thus, the total number of books they collectively read by the end is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he now has:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:
\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages, so he writes 30 pages per week. He can write a page in 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}\):
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss:
- Jason makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

\[
15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the extra minutes he used for other people this month:
- Jason used an additional 300 minutes.

\[
450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, subtract the total minutes used from his phone plan's total of 1000 minutes:
\[
1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[
\boxed{250}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24 fries.
2. **Fries taken by Kyle:** 5 fries.
3. **Fries taken by Billy:** Twice as many as Kyle, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
4. **Fries taken by Colby:** 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so \(10 - 3 = 7\) fries.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fries taken by Kyle, Billy, and Colby:
\[ 5 + 10 + 7 = 22 \]

After these fries are taken, Griffin has:
\[ 24 - 22 = 2 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries from Ginger, Griffin has:
\[ 2 + x \]

According to the problem, after all these transactions, Griffin has 27 fries:
\[ 2 + x = 27 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 27 - 2 \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 25 fries.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked:**
   - The makeup artist works 6 hours each day.
   - She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
   - The movie lasts 5 weeks.

   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 24 \, \text{hours/week}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total hours for 5 weeks} = 24 \, \text{hours/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 120 \, \text{hours} \times 250 \, \text{\$/hour} = 30000 \, \text{\$}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each person ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on each day:

- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we sum the cookies eaten by each person over the two days:

- Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister: \( 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \) cookies.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue: \( 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \) cookies.

Next, we convert the total cookies into calories. Each cookie has 200 calories:

- Calories consumed by Sue's sister: \( 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \) calories.
- Calories consumed by Sue: \( 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the third class. Let's break down the information given:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school has an equal number of boys and girls, meaning 50% of the students are boys and 50% are girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is \(20 - 15 = 5\).
5. The second class has 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is \(20 - 12 = 8\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
\[ \text{Total students} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \]
Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls:
\[ \text{Total boys} = \text{Total girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

We already know the number of boys in the first and second classes:
\[ \text{Boys in first class} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Boys in second class} = 8 \]

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first and second classes from the total number of boys:
\[ \text{Boys in third class} = 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and use the information given to find the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed each day.

1. **Determine the number of wolves and cougars killed last night:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night: \(10 + 15 = 25\).

2. **Determine the number of wolves and cougars killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \(c\).
   - Then the number of wolves killed today is \(3c\).
   - Today, Rick also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars today.
   - Therefore, \(c = 12\).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \(3c = 3 \times 12 = 36\).

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Total animals killed today: \(36 + 12 = 48\).

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:**

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows initially present in the ten stalls. Each stall has 20 cows, so the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. The total number of cows after the purchase is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are then divided equally into the 20 stalls. Therefore, the number of cows in each stall after the new cows are added is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\]

So, Brady has **45.00 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the redwood tree in feet.
2. Determine the original weight of the entire redwood tree.
3. Calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites.
4. Subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight to find the remaining weight.

**Step 1: Calculate the total length of the redwood tree.**

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.

**Step 2: Determine the original weight of the entire redwood tree.**

Each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the weight per foot is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ pounds per foot} \]

The total weight of the entire 200-foot redwood tree is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \times 40 \text{ pounds per foot} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites.**

The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. Therefore, the weight of the eaten wood is:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight to find the remaining weight.**

The remaining weight of the redwood tree is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \), the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \), and the number of apples Andrea has as \( A_a \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_a = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

First, we can find the number of apples Jamal has using the information about Andrea's apples:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the information about the difference between bananas and apples:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[ \text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 2 \times \frac{9,300}{3} = 2 \times 3,100 = 6,200 \]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we can find the dollar amount by dividing the number of pennies by 100:

\[ \text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6,200}{100} = 62 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[ \boxed{62} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry's yard has 8 more trees than Ferdinand's yard. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.03 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.05 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{118000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - First, calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this to the original 20 minutes:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Subtract 5 minutes from the 28 minutes:
     \[
     28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken:**
   - Add the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken:
     \[
     20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[

"To find the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

1. **Windows in bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows.
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total windows:**

"To find out how much change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of the laundry is $9.45.
The cost of the package of pasta is $1.35.

First, we add these amounts together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

1. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the collar, rosette, and body of the sweater from the total gives us the stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[
\text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his practice separately and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song Lines:**
   The solo song has 54 lines. Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

2. **First Scene Lines:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has to memorize a third of the first scene's lines:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene Lines:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the second scene's lines:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute 20 for \( M + R \) in the expression:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as \( R \) and Sam's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To find Ruby's current age, we use the first equation:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

To verify, we check the conditions of the problem:
- In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old, and Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old. Indeed, \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

2. Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots.
5. Find half of the combined total number of spots.

**Step 1: Determine the number of spots a mamba has.**

A cobra has 70 spots, and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:
\[
\frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.**

There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:
\[
40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.**

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:
\[
60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots}

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, we calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and each necklace uses 8 topaz gemstones, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Sum the stories written in the first week.
3. Sum the stories written in the second week.
4. Add the totals from the first and second weeks to get the final total.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum the stories written in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.
So, the total number of stories written in the first week is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\).

Now, we sum the stories written in the second week:
- Alani wrote 40 stories.
- Braylen wrote 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 120 stories.
So, the total number of stories written in the second week is \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\).

Finally, we add the totals from the first and second weeks to get the final total:
\[120 + 240 = 360\]

Thus, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rows of 5-star flags on the 76-star flag. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 stars:**
   \[
   3 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ stars/row} = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 6 stars:**
   \[
   2 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ stars/row} = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 5 stars:**
   \[
   \text{Total stars on the flag} - \text{Stars in rows of 8 stars} - \text{Stars in rows of 6 stars} = 76 - 24 - 12 = 40 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rows of 5 stars:**
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total stars in rows of 5 stars}}{\text{Stars per row}} = \frac{40 \text{ stars}}{5 \text{ stars/row}} = 8 \text{ rows}
   \]

So, the number of rows of 5-star flags is **8**."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a different speed (30 miles/hour), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as \( A \) and the number of medals Izzy has as \( I \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ A = 22 \]
\[ I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is:
\[ A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This can be written as:
\[ 39 = \frac{T}{10} \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then use her hourly rate to find her earnings.

First, let's determine the total time Susan works:
- Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
- She takes a 30-minute break in the middle of her work period.

So, the total time she works is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her hourly rate:
\[ \text{Earnings per 10 minutes} = \$5 \]
\[ \text{Earnings per hour} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times \$5 = 6 \times \$5 = \$30 \]

Now, we can calculate her total earnings for 2.5 hours:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \times \$30 \text{ per hour} = 2.5 \times 30 = \$75 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial points for each player.
2. Check if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.
4. Sum the total points of all three players.

**Step 1: Determine the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Check if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the fourth round: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the fourth round: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the fourth round: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Sum the total points of all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}

"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges. The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons washed 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum up the activities for both days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the household and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2.8 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2.8 \, \text{kg/week}} = 15 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - The opening bid is $200.
   - Carmen's first bid is $200 + $50 = $250.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person's bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's second bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person's bid is $350 + $50 = $400.
   - Carmen's third bid is $400 + $50 = $450.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person's bid is $450 + $50 = $500.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $500 + $50 = $550.

Thus, Carmen's total expenditure is the sum of her bids:
\[ 250 + 350 + 450 + 550 \]

Let's calculate this sum:
\[ 250 + 350 = 600 \]
\[ 600 + 450 = 1050 \]
\[ 1050 + 550 = 1600 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carmen paid for the desk is:
\[
\boxed{1600}

"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to consider both the cost per mile driven and the monthly bonus, then sum these over the year.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven:
- The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for miles driven is \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Now, let's calculate the total bonus for the year:
- John receives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Finally, let's sum the cost for miles driven and the total bonus to get the total annual cost:
- Total annual cost = Cost for miles driven + Total bonus = \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{31800} \]"

"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the amount of money she has left is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. The amount of money she has left after spending $10 on rides is:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in the second year and then calculate the revenue from those sales.

First, let's determine the number of books sold in the first year. We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the number of books sold so far is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

We are also given that the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold in the current year. Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as \( x \). Then the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2x \). We know that \( x = 45 \), so the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year. The total number of books sold so far is 200, and we have already accounted for 90 books sold in the first year and 45 books sold in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider his daily earnings, his weekly earnings, and the additional bonus he received for the month.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- Therefore, his daily earnings are \(10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day}\).

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- Therefore, his weekly earnings are \(5 \text{ days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week}\).

Since April has 30 days, we need to determine how many full weeks and extra days are in April:
- There are 4 full weeks in April (since \(30 \div 7 = 4 \text{ weeks and } 2 \text{ days}\)).

Now, let's calculate his earnings for the 4 full weeks:
- His earnings for 4 weeks are \(4 \text{ weeks} \times \$500/\text{week} = \$2000\).

Additionally, Watson received a $300 bonus for the month.

Finally, we sum up his earnings for the 4 weeks and the bonus:
- Total earnings = \( \$2000 + \$300 = \$2300 \).

So, Watson made \(\boxed{2300}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. If John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can find the number of people he beats by calculating 80% of 20.

\[ \text{Number of people John beats} = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

Since John arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat.

\[ \text{Number of people John lost to} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:**
   The bakery produces 60 loaves each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning.
   \[
   \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:**
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:**
   Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:
   \[
   \text{Afternoon and evening sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:**
   Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
   \[
   \text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight Sandy needs to lose in 4 weeks is 2 pounds. This means Sandy loses:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 1 week), we use the weekly weight loss rate for Sandy:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum up the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person grows an extra arm and how many times they grow an extra leg within that period.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms grown:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm is grown is given by \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs grown:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg is grown is given by \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Since the growth of arms and legs are independent events, the total number of new limbs grown is the sum of the number of extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (new limbs)} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he needs to spend is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, we subtract the total costs from the amount he needs to spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2050 \]"
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's determine how many eggs the three people who eat three eggs each day consume in a day:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs the two people who eat two eggs each day consume in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, we add the number of eggs consumed by both groups in a day:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for the population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(3000 \times \text{Noah's age six years ago} = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile. Then, six years ago, the population was \(\frac{P}{2}\).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{P}{2} = 60000\).

3. **Solve for the current population \(P\):**
   \[
   P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

The current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Next, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who showed up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father:**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:**
   Solomon initially had 50 marbles in the store. He added the 20 marbles he bought from Johanna and received 8 more from his father.
   \[
   \text{Total number of marbles} = 50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles:**
   Each marble weighs 2 kgs. Therefore, the total weight of 78 marbles is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \), the number of girls as \( G \), and the number of nongendered children as \( N \).

Given:
- The classroom has 30 boys, so \( B = 30 \).
- The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, so \( G = 3B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \).
- The number of nongendered children is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the number of boys, so \( N = \frac{1}{10}B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \).

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123. \]

The total number of children in the classroom is \( 123 \)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and knowing that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party initially. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has and then find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils.

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils, we need to determine the total number of pencils and then divide by the number of pencils each box can hold (which is 8).

The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two main parts: the cooling effect and the dilution effect.

1. **Cooling Effect**: Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Therefore, the number of ice cubes used is:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

2. **Dilution Effect**: Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream. This adds 15 milliliters to the volume of the coffee, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters. Therefore, the total weakening due to the cream is:
   \[
   15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Adding the weakening due to the ice cubes and the cream gives us the total weakening of the coffee:
\[
60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of old records brought in by the 5 people.
- \( y \) as the number of new records received by the 5 people.

From the problem, we know that:
1. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
2. 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records.

This gives us the following relationships:
- The total number of old records brought in is \( x \).
- The total number of new records received is \( y \).

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of new records received is half the total number of old records brought in:
\[ y = \frac{x}{2} \]

We also know that the total number of new records received is 7:
\[ y = 7 \]

Substituting \( y = 7 \) into the equation \( y = \frac{x}{2} \):
\[ 7 = \frac{x}{2} \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

We are also given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Therefore, the payment to each senior programmer is:
\[
\text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging that remains.

The phone is at 60% charged, so it needs to reach 100% which means it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points.

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours.

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the first shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the second shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the first shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their first shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 in rewards. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[ \text{Rewards} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the second shopping trip.**

The customer spent $43 on their second shopping trip. They can use the $4 in rewards from their first shopping trip. So, the price after applying the rewards is:
\[ \text{Price after rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes off:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price after applying the coupon is:
\[ \text{Final price} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B.

### Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows.

We can express these pieces of information as the following system of equations:
\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 2 \times H + 4 \times C = 2 \times 40 + 4 \times 20 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal and then find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself.

First, let's denote the weights of the animals as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the weight of the pink frog.
- Let \( B \) be the weight of the blue beetle.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of the green toad.
- Let \( Y \) be the weight of the yellow snake.
- Let \( R \) be the weight of the red bird.

From the problem, we know:
1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the same as the green toad, and 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.
2. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.

Using the information given:
\[ P = B = G = Y - 10 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ P = R + 20 \]

From \( P = 50 \text{ pounds} \), we can substitute into the other equations:
\[ 50 = B = G = Y - 10 \]
\[ 50 = R + 20 \]

Solving for \( Y \) and \( R \):
\[ Y = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ R = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now we know the weights of all the animals:
- Pink frog (P): 50 pounds
- Blue beetle (B): 50 pounds
- Green toad (G): 50 pounds
- Yellow snake (Y): 60 pounds
- Red bird (R): 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. The container weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is:

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs contributed by each type of table and then sum them up.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ 310 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the 7 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies she puts in her son's lunch box and the cookies her husband eats from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

To find 60% of $60, we perform the following calculation:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts after the discount.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"To calculate the percentage increase in the daily profit, we first need to determine the daily profit from tractors and the daily profit from silos.

1. **Daily profit from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Profit per tractor: $100
   - Daily profit from tractors: \( 10 \times 100 = 1000 \) dollars

2. **Daily profit from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Profit per silo: $220
   - Daily profit from silos: \( 5 \times 220 = 1100 \) dollars

3. **Percentage increase in daily profit:**
   - Increase in profit: \( 1100 - 1000 = 100 \) dollars
   - Percentage increase: \( \frac{100}{1000} \times 100 = 10\% \)

The percentage more they are making per day now is **10%**."
"To calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog, we need to first find the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = \$100 \).

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for treats is \( \$20 \).

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for medicine is \( \$100 \).

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for food, treats, and medicine, the total monthly cost is \( 100 + 20 + 100 = \$120 \).

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 months.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is \( 120 \times 12 = \$1440 \).

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga class.
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class.
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, we sum up all the durations:
\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)}
\]

Adding these together:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of roses plant pots is twice the number of daisy plant pots, and there are 30 daisy plant pots needed, the number of rose plant pots needed is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave $4 to her brother. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she saved.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 \]

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 = 25 - 4 = 21 \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \( 21 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we calculate 40% of 50 hours:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of the second tree.
2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the height of the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the shortest tree} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the second tree, which is 5 feet more than the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second trees} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

\[ \$12 \text{ (toy cars)} + \$5 \text{ (teddy bears)} = \$17 \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the costs of the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts rides, and then determine how much money is left for friends to spend.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Since Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf, the cost is $5.
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: Morgan wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens, so the cost is $5.
3. **Cost of go-karts**: Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the cost is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, we add up these costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$5 + \$20 = \$30 \]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After spending $30 on the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts, the remaining budget is:
\[ \$90 - \$30 = \$60 \]

This remaining $60 can be used by Morgan and her friends to spend as they wish. Since we are not given any specific amount that each friend can spend, we assume that the remaining $60 is to be shared among Morgan and her friends. If we let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite, then the total number of people (Morgan + friends) can spend up to $60. If each person spends an equal amount, then the amount each person can spend is:
\[ \frac{60}{n+1} \]

Since the problem does not specify how much each person can spend, we assume the simplest case where each person spends the same amount and the remaining money is distributed equally. If we assume each person can spend up to $10 (a reasonable assumption given the remaining budget), then:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]
This means Morgan can invite 5 friends (since Morgan herself is one person).

Therefore, the number of friends Morgan can invite is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards and forwards with the given information.

1. **Determine the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.
   \[
   \text{Total spent on gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total change Billy received:**
   Billy started with $10 and spent $2 on gumballs.
   \[
   \text{Total change} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy:**
   The total change of $8 was half of the change he took, meaning the full change he had before spending on gumballs was:
   \[
   \text{Full change} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since he spent $2 on gumballs, the amount spent on candy is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on candy} = 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
   \[
   \text{Pounds of candy} = \frac{14}{1.5} = \frac{14 \times 2}{3} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought approximately 9.33 pounds of candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9.33}

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city, and then determine how many miles the train travels in 3 days. Finally, we will find out how many days the train goes between services based on the given service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city.
   \[
   \text{Distance from the third city to the first city} = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ miles}
   \]
   So, the total one-way distance for the trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city is:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]
   Since the train travels this distance twice (once to the third city and once back to the first city), the round trip distance is:
   \[
   225 \times 2 = 450 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the total distance traveled in 3 days:
   The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in 3 days is:
   \[
   450 \times 3 = 1350 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Determine how many days the train goes between services:
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in 3 days by 18,000 and round up to the nearest whole number (since the train needs service after completing the full 18,000 miles interval).
   \[
   \frac{1350}{18000} = 0.075
   \]
   Since 0.075 days is less than 1 day, the train does not need a service during this 3-day period. Therefore, the train goes between services after 3 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now we know:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for John's trip, which includes the time taken for the initial journey to his friend's house and the time taken for the return journey home.

1. **Initial Journey:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Return Journey:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for initial journey + Time for return journey = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The total time taken for the trip is 6 hours. Let's confirm this with the final numerical answer in a separate line.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score on the third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out can be expressed as the sum of those kicked out for each reason:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + 21 = 50. \]

Substituting \( C = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + (4(3) - 5) + 21 = 50, \]
\[ 3 + 12 - 5 + 21 = 50, \]
\[ 31 = 50. \]

This confirms our values for \( C \), shoplifters, and physical violence. Now, to find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of customers kicked out for each of the three reasons from the total number of customers kicked out:
\[ 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19. \]

So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points. Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points as \( E \).

After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points became \( E + 14 \). According to the problem, after scoring these 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

To find \( E \), we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then find out how many of them were faulty and how many were functioning.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. Since 40% of the equipment was faulty, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces were returned, the company only paid for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

So, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240000}

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Determine how many sheep provide 1 kg of milk and how many provide 2 kg of milk.
   - Half of the 30 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep provide 1 kg of milk each.
   - The other half of the 30 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep provide 2 kg of milk each.

2. Calculate the total milk from the sheep that provide 1 kg of milk.
   - Since 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

3. Calculate the total milk from the sheep that provide 2 kg of milk.
   - Since 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

4. Add the milk from both groups of sheep to get the total milk collected every day.
   - The total milk collected every day is \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

So, the final numerical answer is 45 kg."

"To calculate the monthly payment for Karan, we first need to determine the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to find the total amount she will pay back. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Rate (\(R\)) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (\(T\)) = 5 months

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 3650 \times 0.5 = 1825 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount back in 5 equal monthly payments, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $1095 per month.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of making the lemonade. The cost to buy the supplies is $18. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the cost:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{1 \text{ hour}} = \$18/\text{hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. So, we can write the equation as:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the show is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet:
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Since David rides all 9 rides, he only needs one ride bracelet.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- For 9 rides, the total cost is $4 * 9 = $36.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Dasha and David:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30
- The amount David saves: $36 - $30 = $6

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio (5 + 6) represent the total number of popsicles, which is 11 parts in this case.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's convert all the time spent on tasks into the same unit. We'll use hours for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song.
She spends half that time recording, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours recording.
She spends 90 minutes editing. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours (writing)} + 2 \text{ hours (recording)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (editing)} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{1.5}{7.5} = \frac{1.5 \div 1.5}{7.5 \div 1.5} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, given that she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system.

First, calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system:
\[
6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots}
\]

Next, let \( x \) represent the number of books Wendy wants to place in each slot. According to the problem, the total number of books Wendy wants to place is 20 more than double the number of books in the system. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\text{Total number of books} = 2x + 20
\]

Since the total number of books must equal the total number of slots, we set up the equation:
\[
2x + 20 = 36
\]

To find \( x \), solve the equation:
\[
2x + 20 = 36
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
2x = 16
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 8
\]

Now, calculate the total number of books Wendy needs to carry:

4. Compute the total energy savings over 30 days.

**Step 1: Energy Consumption per Hour**
The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

**Step 2: Daily Energy Consumption Before and After Reduction**
- **Before Reduction:** 
  - Time used per day = 8 hours
  - Energy consumption per day = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)
  - Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh): 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

- **After Reduction:**
  - Time used per day = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours
  - Energy consumption per day = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh)
  - Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh): 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

**Step 3: Daily Energy Savings**
- Daily energy savings = Energy consumption before reduction - Energy consumption after reduction
- Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

**Step 4: Total Energy Savings Over 30 Days**
- Total energy savings over 30 days = Daily energy savings * 30 days
- Total energy savings over 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

The total energy savings in kilowatt-hours over 30 days is **135 kWh**."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

   Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

2. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   - There are 3 zebras in total.
   - The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the number of zebras:
   \[
   \frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33
   \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is \(\frac{88}{3}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{88}{3}}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat.
   - Total meat required = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total amount of cheese required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total cheese required = 5 pounds.

4. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.

5. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.

6. **Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
   - Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $50.00.

\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this problem, we will first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has, and then account for the changes he made.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Initial number of corns:**
   According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the initial number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. **After buying more cannolis:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, he bought:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ fewer corns}
   \]
   Therefore, the new number of corns is:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   The combined total is the sum of the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   60 + 100 = 160
   \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total steps Elliott planned to take:**
   Elliott planned to take 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Calculate the steps taken before the jog:**
   Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he took:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
   Additionally, he took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps taken before the jog is:
   \[
   5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Determine the steps taken during the jog:**
   After the jog, Elliott had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the number of steps he took during the jog is the difference between the total planned steps and the steps taken before the jog:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words, the total number of words is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time required to read 9000 words is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the place where he is reading the book as soon as he finishes the book. It takes him 30 minutes to read the book. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time he will spend is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. The number of minutes early Toby will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid in May
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)

First, calculate the weekly wage for one employee:
\[ \text{Weekly wage} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked per week} = 15 \times 40 = 600 \]

Next, calculate the total wage for one employee for the entire month of May:
\[ \text{Monthly wage} = \text{Weekly wage} \times \text{Weeks in May} = 600 \times 4 = 2400 \]

Now, calculate the total wage for all 40 employees in May:
\[ \text{Total wage for May} = \text{Monthly wage per employee} \times \text{Number of employees} = 2400 \times 40 = 96000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who left in June
- Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40
\[ \text{Number of employees who left} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of employees remaining in June
\[ \text{Number of employees remaining} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid in June
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)

First, calculate the weekly wage for one remaining employee:
\[ \text{Weekly wage} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked per week} = 15 \times 40 = 600 \]

Next, calculate the total wage for one remaining employee for the entire month of June:
\[ \text{Monthly wage} = \text{Weekly wage} \times \text{Weeks in June} = 600 \times 4 = 2400 \]

Now, calculate the total wage for all 30 remaining employees in June:
\[ \text{Total wage for June} = \text{Monthly wage per employee} \times \text{Number of remaining employees} = 2400 \times 30 = 72000 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount paid in both months
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total wage for May} + \text{Total wage for June} = 96000 + 72000 = 168000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{168000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with the following terms: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 3 - 1.50 = 1.50).

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 seashells:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 + 6.00 + 1.00 = 11.50 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10:
\[ 10.00 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Sally does not have enough money to buy all the items. She is short by $1.50. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-1.50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. Each pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon needs for 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies are needed based on the recipe.

First, Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Over 30 days, the total number of cookies she needs is:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we know that her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and that 100% of these dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are not dangerous, meaning 1% of the candles are dangerous.

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \]

Next, we know that 5% of the dangerous candles also have the defect of smelling like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of each blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

First, let's find the discount price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]
So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( J_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( J_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( J_{\text{avg}} \). According to the problem, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{tall}} = 30 \). She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, so \( J_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \). Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( J_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ J_{\text{tall}} + J_{\text{short}} + J_{\text{avg}} = 30 + 15 + J_{\text{avg}} = 45 + J_{\text{avg}} \]

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation:
\[ 45 + J_{\text{avg}} + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 150 + J_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_{\text{avg}} \), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]

\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[
124 + d = 180
\]

Subtract 124 from both sides:

\[
d = 180 - 124
\]

\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Day 6:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on day 6: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled over the two weeks:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{8} = 5 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 8:
\[ T = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ T = 40 \]

So, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

The difference in elevation is calculated as follows:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock initially.

2. **Cats carried away**: Four boats each carried away 5 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away is:
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20
   \]
   After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30
   \]

3. **Cats that ran away**: Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran away. First, we calculate 3/5 of 30:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18
   \]
   After 18 cats ran away, the number of cats left on the rock is:
   \[
   30 - 18 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the final number of cats left on the rock is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the rate changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The rate is $8 per month.
   \[
   \text{Cost for first 6 months} = 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The rate is $12 per month.
   \[
   \text{Cost for next 2 months} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18)**: The rate is $14 per month.
   \[
   \text{Cost for next 10 months} = 10 \times 14 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 48 + 24 + 140 = 212 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{212}

"Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

Substituting the value of \( T \):
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \] dollars.

The total cost of both jeans is:
\[ T + J = 28 + 22 = 50 \] dollars.

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). So, \( S = 6 \).

The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}S = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \] dollars.

The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ S - \frac{1}{3}S = 6 - 2 = 4 \] dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know that the jogger jeans originally cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \] dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - She buys 3 more bird feeders.
   - Total bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 bird feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:**
   - Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each made feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   - There are 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders = \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the made feeders:**
   - There are 3 made feeders.
   - Each made feeder attracts 30 birds.
   - Total birds from made feeders = \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds.

5. **Sum the total number of birds attracted by all feeders:**
   - Total birds = Birds from store-bought feeders + Birds from made feeders
   - Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

Thus, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the soup**: 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we calculate \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \). So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
3. **Cost of the cake**: Half of the price of the bagel. So, the cake costs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2x}{3} \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2x}{3} = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket plus the $50 he has left).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \( 100 \) cards.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

This means the caterer prepared 40 hotdogs. However, since 40 guests showed up and each guest wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs per guest} = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer only had 40 hotdogs, so the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 \text{ guests} - 40 \text{ hotdogs} = 0 \text{ guests}
\]

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this value:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters. Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of dragons slain by each prince in sequence.

1. **Calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
     \]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas in each container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas in each container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needed. Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert the amount of gas needed from gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of candy bars George bought.
- \( y \) as the number of bags of chips George bought.

From the problem, we know:
1. The cost of a bag of chips is 40 cents.
2. The cost of a candy bar is 75 cents.
3. George spent $5, which is 500 cents.
4. George got 3 bags of chips, so \( y = 3 \).
5. George had 1% of his money left after buying the chips and candy bars, which means he spent 99% of his money. Therefore, 99% of $5 is 495 cents.

We can now set up the following equations:
1. The total cost equation: \( 40y + 75x = 500 \)
2. The number of bags of chips equation: \( y = 3 \)

Substituting \( y = 3 \) into the total cost equation, we get:
\[ 40(3) + 75x = 500 \]
\[ 120 + 75x = 500 \]
\[ 75x = 380 \]
\[ x = \frac{380}{75} \]
\[ x = \frac{76}{15} \]
\[ x = 5.0667 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar), we need to check if there was a misinterpretation or if the problem has a different solution. However, the problem setup and the arithmetic are correct, and the only logical conclusion is that the number of candy bars George bought is 5.

So, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have eaten. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have:

\[ 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each piece weighs the same, the weight of the pieces they have is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we subtract the weight of the pieces they have from the total weight of the cake to find the remaining weight:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ \boxed{15} \] ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Bernadette should leave her apartment to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne.

First, we know that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater from his hotel. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the 16 minutes it takes her to drive to the theater:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave her apartment 11 minutes before Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the area and the length, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine the final temperature of the house, we need to account for the temperature changes due to the oven and the window over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase Due to Oven**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase due to the oven = \(3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Temperature Decrease Due to Window**:
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = \(30 \text{ minutes} / 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 3 \text{ intervals}\).
   - Total temperature decrease due to the window = \(3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Final Temperature Calculation**:
   - Initial temperature: 40 degrees.
   - Temperature increase due to the oven: +15 degrees.
   - Temperature decrease due to the window: -6 degrees.
   - Final temperature = \(40 + 15 - 6 = 49 \text{ degrees}\).

Thus, the house's final temperature is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"To determine how long it took James to complete the triathlon, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times are:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together gives Jon's total time:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time James takes for the run be \( R \) minutes. The total time James takes to complete the triathlon is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 121 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given the speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 0.5 hours, the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has a total of:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's total points after scoring 26 points:

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points after scoring 10 points:

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's points and Marcy's points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sneakers sold and then subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale:
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each.
- Revenue from the flash sale = \( 17 \times 20 = 340 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
- Total sneakers = 48
- Sneakers sold to the department store = 48 - 17 = 31

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the department store:
- The department store bought each sneaker for $25.
- Revenue from the department store = \( 31 \times 25 = 775 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total revenue:
- Total revenue = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
- Total revenue = \( 340 + 775 = 1115 \) dollars.

The cost of the sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Cost
- Profit = \( 1115 - 576 = 539 \) dollars.

Thus, the salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from the two different types of packets separately and then sum them up.

For the six packets with eight pieces each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Now, we add the totals from both types of packets:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + P + 3 = $15 + P.

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket over buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. This means the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 17 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 17 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - With the new cost per balloon being $65, the total cost for 170 balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication to find the total cost:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results together:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
\[120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\]

Now, add the times to find the total time:
\[2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Therefore, the number of sapphires she has left is:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[
\boxed{6400}

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then sum those amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the raised bed can be considered) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of green and yellow cards, and then sum all the cards.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - Calculate 60% of 15:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Add this to the number of red cards to find the number of green cards:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24
     \]
   - So, there are 24 green cards.

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Calculate the sum of red and green cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]
   - So, there are 39 yellow cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78
     \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw initially. So, her friend saw \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.
3. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there. So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is 45.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after applying the discounts and the coupon, and then find the cost per razor.

First, let's determine the cost of one pack of razors after the buy one get one free offer. Since the pack contains 4 razors and is on sale for buy one get one free, Heather only pays for 2 razors per pack. The original price of one pack is $4.00, so the price per pack after the discount is:

\[ \text{Price per pack} = \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Heather is buying 2 packs, the total cost for 2 packs is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 packs} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost after coupon} = 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Since Heather is buying 2 packs and each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors is:

\[ \text{Total number of razors} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:

\[ \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the question asks for the final numerical answer in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid by summing the heights of all the cheerleaders.

First, let's determine the number of cheerleaders:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall.
- 1 cheerleader is 60"" tall.

So, the total number of cheerleaders is:
\[ 9 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 = 576 + 60 = 636 \]

Next, we need to arrange these cheerleaders in the human pyramid structure:
- 4 girls on the bottom level.
- 3 girls on the second level.
- 2 girls on the third level.
- 1 girl on the top level.

The heights of the cheerleaders are:
- 4 girls at 64"" each.
- 3 girls at 64"" each.
- 2 girls at 64"" each.
- 1 girl at 60"".

Now, we calculate the total height of the pyramid:
- Bottom level: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.
- Second level: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches.
- Third level: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches.
- Top level: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches.

Summing these heights gives the total height of the pyramid in inches:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total height from inches to feet:
\[ 636 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ \boxed{53} \]"
"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of hours Charisma works each day:**
   Charisma works for 8 hours every day.

2. **Determine how many times she walks each day:**
   Charisma walks every hour she is at work. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 8 times a day.

3. **Calculate the total number of walks in 5 days:**
   Since she walks 8 times a day, in 5 days she walks:
   \[
   8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ walks}
   \]

4. **Determine the duration of each walk:**
   Each walk is 5 minutes long.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes walked in 5 days:**
   Since she walks 40 times and each walk is 5 minutes, the total number of minutes walked is:
   \[
   40 \text{ walks} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the current age of Angela as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age. Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

In four years, Angela's age will be her current age plus 4. So, we can write the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we need to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges brought by Ashley. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  C_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- Food for each guest is included in the price, so the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  C_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
C_1 = C_2
\]
Substitute the expressions for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \(L = D + 7\)
2. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)
3. \(L + D + B = 43\)

First, we can express \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\):

From the second equation, we have:
\[B = 2D\]

From the first equation, we have:
\[L = D + 7\]

Now, substituting \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the third equation:
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[4D = 36\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, the number of insects Lily found is \(16\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of a skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we need to add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn altogether.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is by multiplying 364 by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
364 \times \frac{3}{4} = 364 \times 0.75 = 273
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."

"Let's denote the width of the chair as \( C \), the width of the rug as \( R \), and the length of the couch as \( L \).

From the problem statement, we know:
1. The chair is 3 feet wide, so \( C = 3 \) feet.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so \( R = C + 5 \).
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so \( L = 2R + 2 \).

First, we calculate the width of the rug:
\[ R = C + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the length of the couch:
\[ L = 2R + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is \( 18 \) feet.

\[
\boxed{18}

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \), the cost of each pack of grape gum as \( G \), and the cost of each pack of green apple gum as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the cost for strawberry gum is \( 2S \).
3. She bought one pack of grape gum, so the cost for grape gum is \( G \).
4. She bought one pack of green apple gum, so the cost for green apple gum is \( A \).
5. The total cost for all the gum is $7.
6. The cost of grape gum is $2, so \( G = 2 \).
7. The cost of green apple gum is half the cost of grape gum, so \( A = \frac{G}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \).

Now we can set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ 2S + G + A = 7 \]
Substituting the known values of \( G \) and \( A \):
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \( \boxed{2} \)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood that Frederick can buy with his $24 budget to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make.

First, let's calculate the cost per popsicle stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. Therefore, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6. Therefore, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should prioritize buying as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible within his budget.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \]

Each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will give:
\[ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Since Frederick has no remaining budget after buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he cannot buy any 2 x 4 pieces.

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1600} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Mario has 6 dogs.
   - Total number of legs = \( 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed:**
   - Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
   - Total number of pairs of snowshoes = \( \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for the snowshoes:**
   - Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
   - Total cost = \( 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass and then compare it to the cost of the bus pass.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes five bus trips per day.
- Therefore, her total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
- Each bus trip costs her $2.20.
- Thus, her total weekly cost without the bus pass is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\).

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we find the difference between her total weekly cost without the bus pass and the cost of the bus pass:
- The savings would be \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\).

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
\[ 3500 \, \text{calories/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 105,000 \, \text{calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his goal date, July 19th, starting from December 31st. 

From December 31st to December 31st of the same year (2023) is 0 days.
From January 1st to December 31st of the next year (2024) is 365 days.

So, the total number of days from December 31st, 2023, to July 19th, 2024, is:
\[ 365 \, \text{days} + 19 \, \text{days} = 384 \, \text{days} \]

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:

\[ H = 3L \]

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of problems he completes each day.

1. **Total problems**: 100
2. **Problems completed on Monday**: 12
3. **Problems completed on Tuesday**: 3 times Monday's problems = 3 * 12 = 36
4. **Problems completed on Wednesday**: One-quarter of the remaining problems after Monday and Tuesday.

First, calculate the total problems completed by the end of Tuesday:
\[ 12 \text{ (Monday)} + 36 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 48 \]

Now, find out how many problems are left after Tuesday:
\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining 52 problems:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

So, the number of problems left after Wednesday is:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
\[ 39 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then sum these amounts.

1. **Tony's Rate:**
   Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

2. **Bobby's Rate:**
   Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby's rate is:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

3. **Kathy's Rate:**
   Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy's rate is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

4. **Ricky's Rate:**
   Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky's rate is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

5. **Total Rate:**
   To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we sum their individual rates:
   \[
   6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints the house.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, in one day, one person can paint:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
   \]

2. If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people working together can paint:
   \[
   5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
   \]

3. To paint a whole house, 5 people would need:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days}
   \]

4. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours required for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
   \[
   2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} = 48 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \) and the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so the total for Ophelia is \( 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so the total for Jenna is \( 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these totals together, we get:
\[ 42 + 130 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set first. We know that Tom paid a total of $48 for a CD and a headphone set, and the CD cost $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

To find \( H \), we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44. Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have $48 - $44 = $4 left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with the remaining $4 is:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, in 8 years, his cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \).

4. **Find the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - His cousin's current age is 57.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of one monitor as \( M \), and the cost of the printer as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can write the equation for the total cost:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Each boy brought 60 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seashells the girls brought. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls and they brought a total of 840 seashells, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

The number of vlogs made in the first week is 18.
The number of vlogs made in the second week is 21.
The number of vlogs made in the third week is 15.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   \[
   \text{Each boy's initial share} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, the eldest boy initially gets $6.

2. **Adding $5:**
   The eldest boy adds $5 to his share.
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the number of days in April as \(30\) days (since April typically has 30 days).

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. This means that if he saves \(x\) dollars per day in the first half, he will save \(2x\) dollars per day in the second half.

First, we need to determine the number of days in each half of the month. Since April has 30 days, the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's calculate the total savings for the first half of the month:
\[ \text{Total savings in the first half} = 15x \]

Next, we calculate the total savings for the second half of the month:
\[ \text{Total savings in the second half} = 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month should equal Elvis's monthly target of $1125:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have together is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"

So, the final numerical answer is 30 miles."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of letters in the alphabet:**
   The English alphabet consists of 26 letters.

2. **First part of the problem:**
   Elise writes the alphabet in full twice.
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Second part of the problem:**
   Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ letters}
   \]

4. **Third part of the problem:**
   Elise re-writes everything she has already written. This includes the two full alphabets and half of the alphabet.
   \[
   52 \text{ letters} + 13 \text{ letters} = 65 \text{ letters}

   Since she re-writes everything she has already written, she writes the full alphabet twice and half of the alphabet once again.
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}

"To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. Each round, the number of families called is three times the number of families called in the previous round. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is \(\boxed{81}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( J \).

First, we need to find out how many toys are needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so a play set five times larger would have:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan needs is 400, and this is 2 more than what he currently has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ J + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by isolating \( J \):
\[ J = 400 - 2 \]

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy before the discount, then apply the 10% discount, and finally sum up the discounted prices.

1. **Cost of notebooks:**
   - Price per notebook: $1.50
   - Number of notebooks: 5
   - Total cost for notebooks: \( 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \)

2. **Cost of pens:**
   - Price per pen: $0.25
   - Number of pens: 2
   - Total cost for pens: \( 0.25 \times 2 = 0.50 \)

3. **Cost of the calculator:**
   - Price of calculator: $12
   - Number of calculators: 1
   - Total cost for calculator: \( 12 \)

4. **Cost of the geometry set:**
   - Price of geometry set: $10
   - Number of geometry sets: 1
   - Total cost for geometry set: \( 10 \)

Next, we sum up the total costs before the discount:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20.00 \]

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20.00 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 20.00 - 2.00 = 18.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{18.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the sales into segments and apply the commission rates accordingly.

1. For the first $1000 of sales, Antonella earns a 30% commission.
2. For the sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on top of the initial 30%.

Let's calculate the commission for each segment:

1. Commission on the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission on first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

2. Commission on the remaining $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500):
\[ \text{Additional commission on remaining } \$1500 = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

3. Total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned \(\boxed{450}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles Bill needs for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles of water:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he currently has from the total number of bottles he needs:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles both on a cold day and on a hot day, and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a cold day:
- On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. According to the problem, on a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Let's calculate this:
- Twice the time on a cold day is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, on a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day:
- Time for 3 miles on a cold day = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
- Time for 3 miles on a hot day = \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
- Difference = \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and then add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is given as $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
3. Adding the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub gives:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

Thus, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily coffee intake for Octavia and Juan, and then find out how much Juan must reduce his intake to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Determine Octavia's daily coffee intake:**
   - Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( R \).
   - Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee per day.

2. **Determine Juan's daily coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee per day.

3. **Determine the doctor's recommendation for Juan:**
   - The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

4. **Calculate the reduction needed for Juan:**
   - Juan's current intake is \( 5R \) cups.
   - The doctor's recommendation is 4 cups.
   - The reduction needed is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we need to assume the value of \( R \) is such that the reduction is a whole number. Given the context, we can infer that \( R \) must be a value that makes \( 5R - 4 \) a whole number. For simplicity, let's assume \( R = 2 \) (a common daily recommended amount):

\[ 5R - 4 = 5(2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Thus, the reduction needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight of the three friends, we divide the total weight by 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved 10 hours upward from the tip of the pyramid.

Initially, the angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees (the angle of the pyramid from the ground). The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle of the pyramid plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]

\[ \boxed{82} \]"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ages of the two sons.
2. Calculate the total number of candles needed.
3. Determine how many packs of candles are required.
4. Calculate the total cost.

First, we know that one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the second son is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since James needs one candle for each son, the total number of candles is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles} \]

Since a pack contains 5 candles, we need to determine how many packs are required to get at least 20 candles. We do this by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00/\text{tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. The amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00, so half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = \$0.50
   \]
   Therefore, for each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50/\text{tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of goals Richie scored,
- \( M \) as the number of goals Mark scored,
- \( A \) as the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \)
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \)
3. Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \)

First, we substitute the value of \( R \) from the third equation into the first and second equations.

Using \( R = 80 \) in the first equation:
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Using \( R = 80 \) in the second equation:
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now we have the number of goals each teenager scored:
- Richie scored 80 goals,
- Mark scored 60 goals,
- Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual scores:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures Peter buys over the week.

First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5.

\[
\text{Total cost for wooden action figures} = 4 \text{ days} \times \$5 \text{ per figure} = \$20
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = \$70 - \$20 = \$50
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) during which he buys plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2.

\[
\text{Total cost for plastic action figures} = 3 \text{ days} \times \$2 \text{ per figure} = \$6
\]

Now, we calculate how much money Peter has left after buying the plastic action figures.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = \$50 - \$6 = \$44
\]

Next, we determine how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining $44.

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{\$44}{\$2 \text{ per figure}} = 22 \text{ figures}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of action figures Peter buys over the week. He buys 4 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures.

\[
\text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 22 = 26
\]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a week.
3. Determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops and the total number of roses grown by Ford in a week.
4. Multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly difference.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a week:

2. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses. So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a week is:
   \[
   20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses}
   \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops and the total number of roses grown by Ford in a week:

3. The difference is:
   \[
   65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses}
   \]

This means Ford lacks 25 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks every month, we multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:

4. The monthly difference is:
   \[
   25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ roses}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total amount from her initial savings.

First, let's calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months. If Katina removes $100 every month, then over 24 months, she will remove \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[3000 - 2400 = 600\]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the cost of bread per sandwich:**
   - Each loaf of bread makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Cost of one loaf of bread = $3.00.
   - Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Calculate the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich:**
   - Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00.
   - Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost per sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich.
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:**
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Total cost per sandwich * 10.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.30 * 10 = $33.00.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:**
   - Price per sandwich = $7.00.
   - Total revenue for 10 sandwiches = Price per sandwich * 10.
   - Total revenue for 10 sandwiches = $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

6. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue for 10 sandwiches - Total cost for 10 sandwiches.
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is $37.00."

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for new carpet and padding} = \$2592 + \$432 = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \boxed{11232} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Let's denote the number as \( N \). So, the first operation can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{S + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, the second operation can be written as:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times (20 - 12)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Thus, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]

4. **Final Expression**: Simplify the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8 = \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \times 8 = \frac{8 \left( 20 + \frac{N}{2} \right)}{5} = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( N \), the final expression in terms of \( N \) is:
\[
\frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

If we assume \( N \) is not specified and we need a numerical answer, we can consider \( N \) to be a value that simplifies the expression. However, without a specific \( N \), the expression remains as:
\[
\frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

If we assume \( N = 0 \) for simplicity (as it often is in such problems if not specified otherwise):
\[
\frac{160 + 4 \times 0}{5} = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To find out how many cards the boy and his brother have together, we first need to determine how many cards the brother has.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the brother has 2 cards.

Next, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has to find the total number of cards they have together:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7.

\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( x \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be:

\[ x - 0.04x = 520 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} = 541.67 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is:

\[ 542 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 542 \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the durations of the two movies together.

First movie duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Second movie duration: 2 hours and 5 minutes

Convert the first movie duration to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Now add the second movie duration to the first movie duration:
90 minutes (first movie) + 2 hours and 5 minutes (second movie)

Convert 2 hours and 5 minutes to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now add the two durations together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, the total time it will take Max to watch both movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than $76,000. This can be done by finding 70% of $76,000, since 100% - 30% = 70%.

First, calculate 70% of $76,000:
\[ 70\% \times 76,000 = 0.70 \times 76,000 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we need to find the combined value of both houses:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, she bought 12 cups.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, the number of dishes she bought is \(2 \times 12 = 24\).

3. **Determine the number of dishes her friend brought:**
   Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

4. **Determine the number of cups her friend brought:**
   Her friend brought 40 cups, which is the same as Judy.

5. **Calculate the total number of cups brought by both:**
   Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, so the total number of cups is \(12 + 40 = 52\).

6. **Calculate the total number of dishes brought by both:**
   Judy brought 24 dishes and her friend brought 44 dishes, so the total number of dishes is \(24 + 44 = 68\).

7. **Calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both:**
   The total number of utensils is the sum of the total number of cups and the total number of dishes, which is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount applied.**
2. **Determine the total number of contacts Pete will have.**
3. **Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount applied.

- Original price of 1 box: $100.00
- Discount: 10%

Discount amount per box = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00

Discounted price per box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Total cost for 2 boxes = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

### Step 2: Determine the total number of contacts Pete will have.

- Number of contacts per box: 90
- Number of boxes: 2

Total number of contacts = 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.

- Number of pairs of contacts: 180 contacts / 2 contacts/pair = 90 pairs

Cost per pair of contacts = Total cost / Number of pairs = $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00/pair

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{Hours John worked on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Hours John worked on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total hours John worked:
\[ \text{Total hours John worked} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John.

Jill's earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for Jill} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

John's earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for John} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (from aerobics) + 600 calories (from running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. 

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- We divide the total calories burned by the calories per 100 ml of water.
- Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories per 100 ml) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]

The number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in one hour. Adding Ruiz's and Marissa's hourly rates gives:

\[
\text{Combined hourly rate} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} + 45 \text{ pounds per hour} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour}

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade over the 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first 4 hours and the earnings from the next 2 hours.

**First 4 hours:**
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in 4 hours: \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}\).
- Total earnings from the first 4 hours: \(60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30\).

**Next 2 hours:**
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in 2 hours: \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}\).
- Total earnings from the next 2 hours: \(20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12\).

**Total earnings over 6 hours:**
- Total earnings from the first 4 hours: \$30.
- Total earnings from the next 2 hours: \$12.
- Total earnings: \$30 + \$12 = \$42.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires on Jeremy's car undergo in a month and then calculate how many months the tires can last given their total lifespan in rotations.

First, we know that for every 2 miles driven, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. We can calculate the number of rotations per mile and then for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. Since there are 4 tires on the car, the total number of rotations the car can undergo before the tires need to be replaced is:

\[ \text{Total rotations} = 10,440,000 \text{ rotations per tire} \times 4 \text{ tires} = 41,760,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of months the tires can last:

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{41,760,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 288 \text{ months} \]

Finally, to find out how many years this corresponds to, we divide the number of months by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{288 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 24 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 24 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:
\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 initially. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money Joe will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"

   \text{Total butter needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

   John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Subsequent Funding:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]
   After the initial 5 months, the research continues for an additional 45 months.

3. **Funding per Month for Subsequent Months:**
   Each month after the first 5 months, the funding increases by 50%. Therefore, the funding for each month is:
   \[
   100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Funding for Subsequent Months:**
   The total funding for the additional 45 months is:
   \[
   45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total Cost of Research:**
   Adding the initial funding to the funding for the subsequent months, we get:
   \[
   100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to make the comparison easier. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Total cost paid by the company} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we calculate the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Total cost paid by the company} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
2. Determine the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of riders who can stay upright:**
   - We know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright.
   - Calculate 25% of 100:
     \[
     0.25 \times 100 = 25
     \]
   - So, 25 riders can stay upright.

2. **Number of these riders who are women:**
   - We know that 60% of the 25 riders are women.
   - Calculate 60% of 25:
     \[
     0.60 \times 25 = 15
     \]
   - So, 15 riders are women.

3. **Number of these riders who are men:**
   - Subtract the number of women from the number of riders who can stay upright:
     \[
     25 - 15 = 10
     \]
   - So, 10 riders are men.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels and then sum the prices of all three jewels.

First, let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \). According to the problem, \( D = 2000 \).

The price of a gold jewel, \( G \), is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, we can write:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} D \]
Substituting the value of \( D \):
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

The price of a silver jewel, \( S \), is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S = G - 400 \]
Substituting the value of \( G \):
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as \( t \) hours.

In \( t \) hours, Bob will have traveled \( 55t \) miles from his starting point. Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead, the total distance Bob will have traveled by the time Tom catches up is \( 75 + 55t \) miles.

In the same \( t \) hours, Tom will have traveled \( 70t \) miles from his starting point. Since Tom is starting 75 miles behind Bob, the distance Tom will have traveled to catch up is \( 70t \) miles.

At the moment Tom catches up with Bob, the distances traveled by both will be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 75 + 55t = 70t \]

Now, we solve for \( t \):
\[ 75 + 55t = 70t \]
\[ 75 = 70t - 55t \]
\[ 75 = 15t \]
\[ t = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ t = 5 \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). This means he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost of the classes he attends will be \( 60 \) dollars. The cost per class he attends will be:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

According to the problem, this cost per class must be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Then, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Dividing both sides by -10 (and reversing the inequality sign):

\[
4 \geq x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \leq 4
\]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10, and his parents will not sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel combined.

First, let's find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. According to the problem, Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel. Therefore, we calculate Julie's daily customer count as follows:

\[
\text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. Since they both work every day of the week, we sum their daily customer counts:

\[
\text{Total daily customers} = \text{Julie's daily customers} + \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 100 + 50 = 150
\]

Now, we need to find the total weekly production. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily customers by 7:

\[
\text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050
\]

Thus, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is:

\[
\boxed{1050}
\]"
"Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as \( L \) miles.

According to the problem, Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles. Additionally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can write the equation:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation by subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we find the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we find the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \]

Let's confirm this with a Python code calculation.
```python
# Given dimensions and rates
length = 6  # in feet
width = 4   # in feet
depth = 3   # in feet
time_per_cubic_foot = 3  # in seconds

# Calculate the volume of the hole
volume = length * width * depth

# Calculate the total time to dig the hole
total_time = volume * time_per_cubic_foot
total_time
```
```output
Done
```
The total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is \(\boxed{216}\) seconds."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price of the Truck:** $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade:** $7,500
3. **Leather Seats:** One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards:** $500 less than the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package:** $1500

Now, we sum all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

Adding these step by step:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000
\]
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked individually and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time = 4.5 hours

The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance Alisa biked is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[
\text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[
\text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to find the total time taken to dig the well:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total time James hired the carriage.
2. Subtract the 1 hour of free time.
3. Calculate the cost for the paid hours.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour of free time, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour is $15.
- Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.

So, the cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
The cost for the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we sum the costs of the paid hours:
\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \]

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally has in her bank account at the end of the week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have in her bank account based on her weekly wage from the actual amount in her bank account.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she has added $420 - $200 = $220 to her bank account during the week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. If she has $220 more in her bank account than she should have, then the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her bank account.

So, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ R + P = 30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is:

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the first equation as:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

Since each sheep and each goose has one head, the second equation is:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We now have the following system of linear equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step. First, we'll solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, we substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, we check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal $5 per pound coffee.

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time spent sleeping by all the math teachers is:

\[
\text{Total time spent sleeping} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they share equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120. Therefore, Kassidy has:
\[
K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna has:
\[
R = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total amount of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:
\[
\text{Total} = R + K + A = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to add together their money and share it equally, each person would get:
\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we need to check the distribution of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

This means:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are: Good, Neutral, Good

So, we add these to the previous counts:
- Good days: \(8 + 1 + 1 = 10\)
- Bad days: \(8\)
- Neutral days: \(8\)

We have already accounted for 27 days (8 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 27). The remaining days are:
\[
30 - 27 = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Since the next three days are Good, Neutral, Good, we need to check if these fit within the remaining days:
- The first three days are Good, Neutral, Good.

Thus, the remaining days are:
- 3 days left: 0 good days, 0 bad days, 0 neutral days

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
10 - 3 = 7

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches to have consistent units. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The total growth needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches is 12 days. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows:
- \( K \) for Katarina
- \( M \) for Max
- \( C \) for the Cookie Monster
- \( S \) for Summer

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we can substitute the value of \( K \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the second equation:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, we can find the number of cookies Summer has using the third equation:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these values:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( T = Tr + 7 \)
2. \( 2T + 3Tr = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( T \) in the second equation with \( Tr + 7 \):

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we have the value of \( Tr \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( T \):

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

\[ 2.00 + 4c = 3.20 \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 4c = 3.20 - 2.00 \]
\[ 4c = 1.20 \]
\[ c = \frac{1.20}{4} \]
\[ c = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month and per year:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in one year, Rong saves \(20 \times 12 = 240\) coins.

Next, we calculate how many coins Rong saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Rong saves \(240 \times 10 = 2400\) coins.

Now, let's determine how many coins Neil saves per month:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

Next, we calculate how many coins Neil saves in one year:
- In one year, Neil saves \(28 \times 12 = 336\) coins.

Then, we calculate how many coins Neil saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Neil saves \(336 \times 10 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we sum the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- The total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil together is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and John needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]
Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:
\[ T = 40 + H \]
Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
To isolate \( T \), we subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
Solving for \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas, apples, and oranges in the crate.

First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The total cost for the bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The total cost for the apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The total cost for the oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total price of the crate:
\[5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to first determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required and compare it to the number of chairs currently available.

First, we know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
\[ \text{Total number of chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we know the restaurant currently has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs currently available is:
\[ \text{Total number of chairs available} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs available from the number of chairs needed:
\[ \text{Number of additional chairs needed} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of additional chairs Mia has to get is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement} = 2400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ \text{Amount for car payment} = 2400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Amount left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's and then use the total capacity of all three trucks.

1. **Determine Gordy's truck capacity:**
   - Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.
   - Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
   - Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

2. **Set up the equation for the total capacity:**
   - Let \( G \) be the capacity of Gary's truck.
   - The total capacity of all three trucks is given as 11,600 pounds.
   - Therefore, the equation is: \( 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600 \).

3. **Solve for \( G \):**
   \[
   4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600
   \]
   \[
   8,800 + G = 11,600
   \]
   \[
   G = 11,600 - 8,800
   \]
   \[
   G = 2,800

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know the following:

1. There are 8 males and 6 females.
2. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
3. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
4. There were no leftovers.

First, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
\[
\text{Total dumplings eaten by females} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:
\[
\text{Total dumplings eaten by males} = 8 \times 4 = 32
\]

Now, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to find the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[
\text{Total dumplings cooked} = 18 + 32 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to raise this amount, assuming they raise an equal amount each hour.

1. **Calculate the remaining amount to be raised:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]

2. **Determine the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount:**
   Since they raise an equal amount each hour, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour.
   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}}
   \]
   We know they raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:
   \[
   \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700
   \]
   Therefore, the number of hours needed to raise the remaining $4200 is:
   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours needed:**

"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from the total percentage of water used by Colorado City to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the total water from the Colorado River that is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40 \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, we need to find the percentage of the total water from the Colorado River that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes. This is the remaining part of the 40% used by Colorado City:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ \boxed{8\%} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \text{Rate of chocolate ice cream} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \text{Rate of vanilla ice cream} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
\[
\text{Total chocolate ice cream} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
\]

Next, we calculate the total production of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
\[
\text{Total vanilla ice cream} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
\]

Finally, we find the total production of both types of ice cream in 48 hours:
\[
\text{Total ice cream} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}

- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find the discount amount:

\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

So, Marcus' total bill is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To solve this, let's first understand the deal: for every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops she gets, she only pays for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's determine how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00:
\[ \text{Number of scoops she can buy} = \frac{\$6.00}{\$1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, considering the deal, for every 2 scoops she pays for, she gets 1 free. So, with 4 scoops she can buy, she will get 2 free scoops (since 4 scoops / 2 = 2 free scoops).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she can get is:

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total area of the bathroom.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's start with the first step:

The total area of the bathroom is 36 sq ft. Two thirds of this area is:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we move to the second step. We know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries he picked.

The fixed fee is $20, and the variable fee is $1.5 per pound. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries. Therefore, the variable cost is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the fixed fee to the variable cost gives the total cost James incurred:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

"First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we have:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we determine how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, the number of people who accept the position is:

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she taps her feet.

1. **Determine the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:**
   - Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute.
   - Helga taps her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
   - Therefore, the combined rate when her arms are at her sides is \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
   - For 3 minutes (since she dances a total of 5 minutes with her arms raised for 2 minutes, she has 3 minutes with her arms at her sides), the total number of taps is \(550 \times 3 = 1650\).

2. **Determine the number of taps when her arms are raised:**
   - Helga taps each foot at 200 taps per minute.
   - Therefore, the combined rate when her arms are raised is \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
   - For 2 minutes, the total number of taps is \(400 \times 2 = 800\).

3. **Calculate the total number of taps:**
   - The total number of taps is the sum of the taps when her arms are at her sides and the taps when her arms are raised.
   - Thus, the total number of taps is \(1650 + 800 = 2450\).

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself.

1. **Damage to his car**: $450
2. **Fine from the city council**: $120
3. **Cost of asphalt**: 3 buckets at $25 each

Let's calculate the cost of the asphalt:
\[ 3 \text{ buckets} \times \$25 \text{ per bucket} = \$75 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \$450 + \$120 + \$75 = \$645 \]

The total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself is $645.

Since the pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is:
\[ \$450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices eaten and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his 4 friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Each of these 3 people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, each of these 3 people ate:
\[ 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these 2 people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, each of these 2 people ate:
\[ 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 people is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all 5 people, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is given by the sum of the times divided by the number of animals:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of Topher's shoe as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by first subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Now, we sum the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.
2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining people.
4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with step 1:

- Total number of people = 5000
- Fraction of people who had voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5}\)

Number of people who had voted by midday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

Now, for step 2:

- Number of people remaining after midday:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

For step 3:

- Fraction of remaining people who had voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Finally, for step 4:

- Number of people who had not voted by 16:00:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. So the total number of smores needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores/kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 2 \text{ smores/adult} = 18 + 12 = 30 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 30 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to find out how many sleeves are required to make 30 smores. We do this by dividing the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3.75 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since we can't buy a fraction of a sleeve, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 4 sleeves of graham crackers.

Finally, we need to determine how many boxes of graham crackers are required. Since each box contains 3 sleeves, we divide the total number of sleeves needed by the number of sleeves per box:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1.3333 \text{ boxes} \]

Again, since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 2 boxes of graham crackers.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Dora's father and mother based on the information provided and then find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, let's denote Dora's age as \( D \). According to the problem, Dora is 15 years old, so:
\[ D = 15 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's father's age. The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Therefore, we can express Dora's father's age as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2D + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age into the equation:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Now, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Finally, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We add their ages together:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

- French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
- English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
- History book: Weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A received 20% of the votes, candidate B received:

\[ 20\% + 50\% \times 20\% = 20\% + 10\% = 30\% \]

So, candidate B received 30% of the votes. Now, let's calculate the total percentage of votes received by candidates A and B combined:

\[ 20\% + 30\% = 50\% \]

This means that the remaining percentage of votes went to candidate C:

\[ 100\% - 50\% = 50\% \]

Given that there were 100 voters, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ 50\% \times 100 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving 10 apples to Beck, Boris's new number of apples is:

\[ \text{Boris's new apples} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck's new number of apples is:

\[ \text{Beck's new apples} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's new apples} - \text{Beck's new apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck now has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the giant, medium, and small ice cubes and then subtract this from the initial 32 ounces of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
\[ 3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
\[ 7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
\[ 8 \text{ small cubes} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ ounce per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces of water to find out how much water is left:

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can determine how many books Alice has. We know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.
- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball.

So, we can write the following equations based on the information given:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
\[ V + M = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the second equation:
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have based on the information given.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112. \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224. \]

Now, to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:
\[ \text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336. \]

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the 54 students were divided into 12 groups.

We start by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups. This means that 12 groups cannot be formed with 54 students.

Next, we need to find out how many groups can be formed with 54 students if each group has an equal number of students. We do this by finding the largest whole number that divides 54 evenly. The factors of 54 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54 \]

The largest factor that is less than or equal to 12 is 9. Therefore, if we form 9 groups, each group will have:
\[ \frac{54}{9} = 6 \text{ students} \]

Since 12 groups cannot be formed, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups. We already know that 9 groups can be formed, so we need:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ more groups} \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental pattern and then sum up the totals.

First, let's determine the number of chairs rented during a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- In a 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Chairs rented on weekdays: \(20 \text{ days} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\)
- Chairs rented on weekends: \(8 \text{ days} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 800 \text{ chairs}\)

Adding these together gives the total chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[ 1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs} \]

Since we are considering two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one month by 2:
\[ 2000 \text{ chairs/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas: \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas stolen, leaving Gunther with \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas: \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.
4. The next day, Arnold stole 12 bananas: \( 49 - 12 = 37 \) bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas: \( 37 + 6 = 43 \) bananas.

So, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

\[
\boxed{43}

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we find the monthly cost per roommate:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{\text{Total monthly cost}}{\text{Number of roommates}} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost per roommate:
\[ \text{Annual cost per roommate} = \text{Monthly cost per roommate} \times 12 = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, let's convert the dozens into individual items. Since one dozen equals 12 items:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:

- Remaining glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\) glasses.
- Remaining plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\) plates.

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total items: \(86 + 42 = 128\).

So, the final numerical answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them.
\[ 90\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \]
So, Lorraine trades 27 small stickers for large buttons.

### Step 2: Determine the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading small stickers.
Each small sticker is worth one small button, and each large button is worth three small buttons. Therefore, each small sticker is worth \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button.
\[ 27 \text{ small stickers} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ large button per small sticker} = 9 \text{ large buttons} \]
So, Lorraine gets 9 large buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them.
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \]
So, Lorraine trades 20 large stickers for large buttons.

### Step 4: Determine the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers.
Each large sticker is worth one large button.
\[ 20 \text{ large stickers} = 20 \text{ large buttons} \]
So, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of large buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine initially has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers. She also gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
\[ 9 + 20 = 29 \text{ large buttons} \]
So, Lorraine has 29 large buttons.

### Step 6: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for small buttons.
Lorraine trades the remaining 10 large stickers for small buttons.
\[ 10 \text{ large stickers} \times 3 \text{ small buttons per large button} = 30 \text{ small buttons} \]
So, Lorraine trades 10 large stickers for 30 small buttons.

### Step 7: Calculate the total number of small buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine initially has 30 small stickers and trades 30 small stickers for small buttons.
\[ 30 \text{ small stickers} - 30 \text{ small stickers traded} = 0 \text{ small stickers remaining} \]
So, Lorraine has 0 small stickers remaining, and she has 30 small buttons from trading.

### Step 8: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 30 small buttons.
\[ 29 \text{ large buttons} + 30 \text{ small buttons} = 59 \text{ buttons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week mentioned.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{XS} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   \[
   \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, to find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we sum up all the students needing each size:
\[
\text{Total} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

Adding these together:
\[
11 + 22 = 33
\]
\[
33 + 18 = 51
\]
\[
51 + 9 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 15 = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
people who do not think horse #2 will win.

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This leaves:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
people who do not think horse #7 will win.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:
\[ 16 \]

\[ 16 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

The problem states that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so the amount of money Jayden still needs is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half the second house, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) cases. Therefore, the third house needs \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cases.

The number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]
So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours, but we need to find out how much time they spent driving. Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]
At a speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:
\[ 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can express these relationships as:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \) (since they finish 4 seconds slower, they get 30 points for every second less than 60 seconds)

Now, let's calculate the points for each player:
- Ava's points: \( 10 \times 8 + 5 \times 3 + 1680 = 80 + 15 + 1680 = 1775 \)
- Emma's points: \( 10 \times 0 + 5 \times 0 + 1680 = 1680 \)

The difference in their scores is:
\[ 1775 - 1680 = 95 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this combined cost by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
   \[
   30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract this amount from the total cost of the four pizzas to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Divide the combined cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of times they ride their bikes on a regular day:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day on regular days.
   - There are 5 regular days in a week.

   Therefore, the total number of rides on regular days is:
   \[
   3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:**
   - On these two days, they ride twice as many times as they do on a regular day.
   - Twice the number of rides on a regular day is:
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}
   \]
   - There are 2 days with this increased frequency.

   Therefore, the total number of rides on these two days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Add the rides from the regular days and the rides from the other two days:
   \[
   15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
   \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying \(O\) orange and \(W\) white fish, the total number of fish in the pond became \(7 + O + W\).

The problem states that after adding the fish from the pet store, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish. So, the number of orange fish in the pond is \(3 + O\) and the number of white fish in the pond is \(4 + W\). According to the problem, we have the equation:
\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

We also know that the total number of fish added from the pet store is 17, so:
\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

Let's solve the first equation for \(O\):
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O = 5 + 2W\]

Now substitute \(O = 5 + 2W\) into the second equation:
\[5 + 2W + W = 17\]
\[5 + 3W = 17\]
\[3W = 12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 5 + 2W\):
\[O = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13\]

We can verify the solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish.
- He bought 13 orange and 4 white fish.
- The total number of fish added is \(13 + 4 = 17\).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \(3 + 13 = 16\) and the number of white fish is \(4 + 4 = 8\).
- Indeed, 16 is twice 8.

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy drives from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - Total distance driven in a week is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - Therefore, the amount of fuel consumed in a week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed in a week:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of the fuel consumed in a week is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming **15 dollars** per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, so the total amount from the twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, she spent:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

She also spent all 140 quarters, which is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she spent for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final numerical answer is 6."

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Finally, let's determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal:
- Hours needed = Total hours required - Total hours played
- Hours needed = \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car's speed is 60 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.
- Distance traveled by the first car = speed × time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car's speed is 70 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.
- Distance traveled by the second car = speed × time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Distance difference = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the pass rates for each grade level and then find the weighted average of these rates based on the number of students in each grade.

1. **Third Grade Pass Rate:**
   - Number of third graders: 500
   - Number of third graders who passed: 340
   - Pass rate for third graders: \(\frac{340}{500} = 0.68\) or 68%

2. **Fourth Grade Pass Rate:**
   - Number of fourth graders: 100
   - Number of fourth graders who passed: 40
   - Pass rate for fourth graders: \(\frac{40}{100} = 0.40\) or 40%

3. **Fifth Grade Pass Rate:**
   - Number of fifth graders: 400
   - Number of fifth graders who passed: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\)
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: \(\frac{80}{400} = 0.20\) or 20%

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate by taking the weighted average of the pass rates for each grade, using the number of students in each grade as the weight.

\[
\text{Overall Pass Rate} = \left(\frac{500}{500 + 100 + 400} \times 0.68\right) + \left(\frac{100}{500 + 100 + 400} \times 0.40\right) + \left(\frac{400}{500 + 100 + 400} \times 0.20\right)
\]

Simplify the weights:

\[
\text{Overall Pass Rate} = \left(\frac{500}{1000} \times 0.68\right) + \left(\frac{100}{1000} \times 0.40\right) + \left(\frac{400}{1000} \times 0.20\right)
\]

\[
\text{Overall Pass Rate} = (0.5 \times 0.68) + (0.1 \times 0.40) + (0.4 \times 0.20)
\]

\[
\text{Overall Pass Rate} = 0.34 + 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.46
\]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 46%.

\[
\boxed{46\%}

"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, Dale had 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies.
3. After selling 150 candies, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies. This means he was short by 50 candies.
4. He then ordered 100 more candies, so he now has -50 + 100 = 50 candies.

To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we need to consider that he has 50 candies left to sell out of the 150 he has sold plus the 100 he ordered. Therefore, he still needs to sell 150 - 50 = 100 candies.

The final numerical answer is:
100"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month from the beginning of the year to the end of May, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **Doubling every month**: The number of students doubles each month.

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students:

- **Additional students by the end of May**: \(320 - 10 = 310\)

Thus, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310.

\[

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = 420
\]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = 60
\]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[
60

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first set of flowers: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. For the second set of flowers: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. For the third set of flowers: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. For the fourth set of flowers: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower from each set. Since she drops 1 flower from each of the 4 sets, she drops a total of 4 flowers. The number of petals dropped is:
\[1 \times (5 + 6 + 4 + 7) = 1 \times 22 = 22\]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jack and his friends use based on the time they play and the rate at which they use quarters.

1. **Jack's Playing Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **First Friend's Playing Time:**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 6 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **Second Friend's Playing Time:**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 6 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Third Friend's Playing Time:**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \( 1.5 \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 18 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - First Friend: 6 quarters
   - Second Friend: 6 quarters
   - Third Friend: 18 quarters
   - Total: \( 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 \text{ quarters} \).

Since each quarter costs 1 dollar, the total amount of money used is 42 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:

- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar in ounces.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:

\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into this equation, we get:

\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 6S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil \( O \):

\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars and gives away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he gives away or sells is \(8 + 16 = 24\) cars.

"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she spent walking each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she spent walking on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time spent walking on both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping cost consists of two parts: the weight-based cost and the distance-based cost.

1. **Weight-based cost**: The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Weight-based cost} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Distance-based cost**: The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   \[
   \text{Distance-based cost} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total shipping cost**: Add the weight-based cost and the distance-based cost.
   \[
   \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
\[
\text{Refundable amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refundable amount from the total shipping cost.
\[
\text{Money lost} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the negative value indicates that Milly actually gains money, the correct interpretation is that she loses $21.00.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. **First week production:** 8,000 bars
2. **Second week production:** Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third week production:** Three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost:**
   - The base installation cost is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items:**
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item.

3. **Calculate the number of additional items:**
   - Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.
   - Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
   - Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.
   - Total additional items: 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 additional items.

4. **Calculate the cost for additional items:**
   - Cost for additional items = 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Base cost + Cost for additional items
   - Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[
20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]
Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:
\[
30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{42.00}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the given relationships step by step, starting from Pompei and moving up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since we need the final answer in feet, we convert 480 inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of his journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and use the relationship between distance, rate, and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

First, let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \), the speed of each kangaroo as \( v \), and the time taken by the 3 kangaroos as \( t = 18 \) hours.

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can write:

\[ D = v \times 18 \]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t_t \) be the time taken by the 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \). Using the distance formula again, we have:

\[ D = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t_t \]

Since \( D = v \times 18 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t_t \]

To find \( t_t \), we solve for \( t_t \):

\[ 18 = \frac{t_t}{2} \]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ t_t = 36 \]

Thus, it will take the 4 turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of dishes each person made and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Rory made:**

   - Therefore, Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Jada made:**
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   - Rory made 40 dishes.
   - Therefore, Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

3. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:**
   - Kora made 20 dishes.
   - Rory made 40 dishes.
   - Jada made 80 dishes.
   - The total number of dishes is \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\).

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has:
\[ 150 \text{ (from her part-time job)} + 80 \text{ (from her mom)} + \text{money in her purse} = 230 + \text{money in her purse} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount of money she has is $400 - $50 = $350. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]

Solving for the money in her purse:
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Craig starts with $40.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys six squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total cost for the squirt guns is $12.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys three packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

So, the total cost for the packs of water balloons is $9.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the cost of the packs of water balloons:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's denote the number of socks Peter has as \( P_s \), the number of dishes Peter has as \( P_d \), the number of socks Jack has as \( J_s \), and the number of dishes Jack has as \( J_d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so \( J_d = 2J_s \).
2. Jack collected 60 dishes, so \( J_d = 60 \).
3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so \( P_d = \frac{1}{2}J_d \).
4. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so \( P_s = 2J_s \).

First, we can find the number of socks Jack has:
\[ J_d = 60 \]
\[ J_s = \frac{J_d}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we can find the number of dishes Peter has:
\[ P_d = \frac{1}{2}J_d = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \]

Then, we can find the number of socks Peter has:
\[ P_s = 2J_s = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[ \text{Total} = P_s + P_d + J_s + J_d = 60 + 30 + 30 + 60 = 180 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to first determine the simple interest earned and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\) per year
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:

1. Calculate the number of goats left in Farm X after selling 10 goats.
2. Calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y after selling twice as many goats as were sold from Farm X.
3. Add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y to get the total number of goats left.

Let's start with Farm X:
- Initially, Farm X has 55 goats.
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

Next, let's consider Farm Y:
- Initially, Farm Y has 45 goats.
- Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he sold from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), substituting \( B = Y + 3 \) gives \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to ensure there are no leftover glue sticks, he must round up to the next whole number. This is because buying 6 packs would only provide:

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

which is not enough for 54 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has at least 54 glue sticks. Checking the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

This provides 56 glue sticks, which is more than enough and leaves 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people day by day, given that each infected person infects six others every day.

**Day 0 (initial state):**
- Number of infected people = 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people = Initial infected people + New infections = \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people = Infected people at the end of Day 1 + New infections = \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people = Infected people at the end of Day 2 + New infections = \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]
\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave her three daughters a total of 2 oranges each, which amounts to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) oranges. Her son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\). 

Subtracting the oranges given away from the initial amount, we get \(12 - 9 = 3\).

So, the final number of oranges Jennifer remained with is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges each person earns per month:
- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber earns badges twice as slowly as Claire, so Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
- Wendy earns badges three times as fast as Claire, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

Next, we calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year (12 months):
- Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges in a year.
- Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges in a year.
- Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges in a year.

Now, we find the difference in the number of badges Wendy earns compared to Amber:
\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ \text{Number of students} = 50 \]
\[ \text{Burritos per student} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos given to students} = 50 \times 10 = 500 \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ \text{Burritos eaten by Mr. George} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos given to students and eaten by Mr. George} = 500 + 20 = 520 \]

Now, subtract the total number of burritos given to the students and eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ \text{Total burritos ordered} = 600 \]
\[ \text{Total leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80 \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red cars as \( R \), the number of green cars as \( G \), the number of blue cars as \( B \), and the number of yellow cars as \( Y \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( R = 12 \)
- \( G = R - 2 \)
- \( B = 3G \)
- The total number of cars is \( R + G + B + Y = 75 \)

First, we calculate the number of green cars:
\[ G = R - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars:
\[ B = 3G = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \), \( G \), and \( B \) into the total number of cars equation:
\[ R + G + B + Y = 75 \]
\[ 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 52 + Y = 75 \]

Solving for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. From the third equation, we can express \( A \) as \( A = F - 12 \). Substituting this into the second equation gives us \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now we substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. To verify, we can find the number of books Anne and Sofie have:
\[ A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \]
\[ S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \]
Checking the total:
\[ S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \]
The total is correct, so the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 10 pounds, the weight of the carrots is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required. We know that one box of jello makes 10 small jello cups. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$15.00 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 500 \]"
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month.

Given that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 per month, we can calculate her monthly payment as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:
\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:
\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we add up all the pieces Tobias ate over the three days:
\[
24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00.

First, we calculate the cost of one bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 13.00 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:

First, let's calculate the number of correctly answered multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
- She correctly answers 80% of them.
- Number of correctly answered multiple-choice questions = \(10 \times 0.80 = 8\).

Next, let's calculate the number of correctly answered true/false questions:
- There are 20 true/false questions.
- She correctly answers 90% of them.
- Number of correctly answered true/false questions = \(20 \times 0.90 = 18\).

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost per chicken.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the total revenue from selling the chickens is $9000 and this is the amount Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens is:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:
\[
\frac{7000}{180} = \frac{7000 \div 20}{180 \div 20} = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken}
\]

However, the question asks for the cost per chicken, which is the total cost divided by the number of chickens sold. Therefore, the cost per chicken is:
\[
\frac{7000}{180} = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken}
\]

But the exact numerical answer in the simplest form is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{350}{9}}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can denote the number of glasses sold by each boy as \( x \).

The total number of glasses sold can be expressed as:
\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is given as $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have after selling the rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will have is:

\[
\text{Total money Sarah will have} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost for 26 meters} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she has:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( M \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 18 - 10 \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, so we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items she is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since one pack of bacon costs $2, one packet of chicken costs:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since one pack of strawberries costs $4, one pack of apples costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, there is a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the concert time and the encore time, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones were successfully paired and then calculate the number of pairs.

First, let's find out how many microphones couldn't be paired. We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones couldn't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that were successfully paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that were arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

5. Convert the number of flowering plants into a percentage of the total number of plants.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Number of indoor plants = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\)

Next, step 2:

2. Remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants = \(100 - 25 = 75\)

Then, step 3:

3. Number of outdoor plants = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50\)

Now, step 4:

4. Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants = \(75 - 50 = 25\)

Finally, step 5:

5. Percentage of flowering plants = \(\left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \times 100 = 25\%\)

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is 25%."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

Given:
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day, and the total cost is $11.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is $1.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the number of hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week. So, $12 per hour * 40 hours = $480.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{480}

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \) and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \).

The payment Tasha received from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:
- From Joe's lawn: \( 6x \) dollars (since Joe paid her $6 each time).
- From Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) dollars.
- From Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) dollars.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54x \]

To find the value of \( x \), we need to determine if \( 54x \) can be a whole number that, when subtracted from 80, leaves a whole number. Since $80 is the total amount and $54x$ must be a whole number, \( x \) must be a whole number. Let's test possible values of \( x \):

If \( x = 1 \):
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

This means Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales. We can verify this by checking if the values fit the problem statement:
- From Joe's lawn: \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) dollars.
- From Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3 \times 1 = 18 \) dollars.
- From Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5 \times 1 = 30 \) dollars.
- Total from mowing lawns: \( 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \) dollars.
- Total earnings: \( 54 + 26 = 80 \) dollars.

The values fit the problem statement, so the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to determine his total earnings from renting his car and then subtract his monthly car payment.

First, let's calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

So, the total number of hours rented per month is:
\[ 10 \text{ rentals} \times 3 \text{ hours per rental} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25 \text{ per hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we subtract his monthly car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Anis rowed.
2. Add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis.

First, we know that Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 50 miles:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]
So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the distance Anis rowed is:
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's summarize the information given:

- Yesterday:
  - Denise read 10 pages.
  - Daniel read 13 pages.

- Today:
  - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
  - Daniel read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the number of pages Denise read today:
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel yesterday, so:
  \[
  13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:
- Denise's total:
  \[
  10 \text{ (yesterday)} + 18 \text{ (today)} = 28 \text{ pages}
  \]

- Daniel's total:
  \[
  13 \text{ (yesterday)} + 0 \text{ (today)} = 13 \text{ pages}
  \]

Finally, we find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel:
\[
28 - 13 = 15 \text{ pages}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is available and how it can be distributed among the family members.

First, let's establish the capacity of the pot:
- The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls.
- The pot can also fill 8 child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining soup will be for the two children.

The total capacity of the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 2 adult bowls have already been used, the remaining soup can fill:
\[ 8 \text{ child bowls} - 2 \text{ adult bowls} = 6 \text{ child bowls} \]

Calvin and his wife each have one bowl, so the remaining soup can be divided among the two children. Therefore, each child can have:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 3 \text{ bowls} \]

So, each child will be able to have 3 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then add them together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to find out how much material is required for one small mask and one large mask.

From the given information:
- 2 yards of material are needed to make 4 small masks. Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- 2.25 yards of material are needed to make 3 large masks. Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]

Now, we can calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material needed for 20 small masks:
  \[
  20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]
- Material needed for 8 large masks:
  \[
  8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total material needed:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

So, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog, and then subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

First, we calculate the total time spent on sleeping, working, and walking the dog:
\[10 \text{ (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ (working)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours}\]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age and \( A \) be Adam's age.

From the problem, we know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, \( D = 60 \).

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).

Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. This gives us the equation:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
1. Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.
2. Adding 100 acres to this gives \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Next, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined:
1. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
2. Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. To find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Since Colby is paid $0.20 for each package he completes, we calculate his total earnings for the day by multiplying the number of packages he completes by the amount he is paid per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

We are given that \( R = 20 \) and the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The total pieces of bologna thrown can be expressed as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( Y = 6 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had combined and then divide that amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen (12) balloons, we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons are in 12 balloons:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ balloons}}{2 \text{ balloons/set}} = 6 \text{ sets}
   \]
   Therefore, the cost for the balloons is:
   \[
   6 \text{ sets} \times \$0.5/\text{set} = \$3
   \]
3. The ice cream costs $7 per tub, and they bought 2 tubs:
   \[

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split this amount equally, we divide $28 by 2:
\[
\frac{\$28}{2} = \$14
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students combined. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups of tea in total. Since the cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea. However, since we can't have half cups in this context, we need to consider the integer division, which implies that each row has 4 cups of one type of tea and 5 cups of the other type of tea (or vice versa), but the key is that each row has 4.5 cups of each type of tea in a theoretical sense.

Next, we know that the remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since the total number of cups is 27, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is \( 27 - 15 = 12 \). As each row has 9 cups, and there are 3 rows, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 - 15 = 12 \). This confirms our earlier division.

Since each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( 4.5 \).

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \(\boxed{4.5}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and each trip takes 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the total time the sloth spends picking berries in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, in 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips (since \(8 \div 4 = 2\)).

Let \(b\) be the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can set up the following equation:
\[2b = 24\]

To find \(b\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:
\[b = \frac{24}{2} = 12\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to account for all the expenses Colby has already made and then determine how much money he has left to spend on additional movie tickets.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:**
   - Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn, so the cost for popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
   - Candy costs $2 per box.
   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so the cost for candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
   - Total spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying popcorn and candy:**
   - Colby started with $150.
   - After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, the remaining money is \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of tickets for the remaining movies:**
   - Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, totaling \(5 + 8 = 13\) movies.
   - Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, he can only see one more movie on Friday or Saturday. Therefore, he can see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday.
   - The cost for one movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday is $10.
   - The cost for one movie ticket on any other day is $7.
   - Since he can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday, the cost for this ticket is $10.

4. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the last movie ticket:**
   - After buying the last movie ticket, the remaining money is \(126 - 10 = 116\) dollars.

5. **Determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining money:**
   - The cost for one movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday is $10.
   - The cost for one movie ticket on any other day is $7.
   - With $116, he can buy \(116 \div 10 = 11\) more tickets on a Friday or Saturday, and \(116 \div 7 \approx 16.57\), meaning he can buy 16 more tickets on any other day.
   - Therefore, he can see \(11 + 16 = 27\) more movies.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ \text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the overall total calories:
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean by \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Q + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Q = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Q + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = Q + J = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spitted:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost under the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost under the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of hay required for both the goats and the sheep.

First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:
\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds:
\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds:
\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour to ensure the full hour is covered. Therefore, the labor cost for 2.25 hours is $35 * 2 = $70.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, we sum these components:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 70 + 60 = 170

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- The commission rate on each New York Times is 10%.
- Therefore, the commission per New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- The commission rate on each Wall Street Journal is 8%.
- Therefore, the commission per Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Thus, the total commission Cayley will earn is \(\boxed{15.00}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, we substitute the value of \( D \) into the second equation to find \( M \):
\[ M = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now we know Marcus is 21 years old. Using the first equation, we can find Leo's age:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]
To solve for \( L \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \) using the second equation:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation. From the first equation, we know \( B = A + 20 \). Substituting \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = B - 10 = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) into the third equation, we get:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. To verify, we can find the points scored by Bahati and Dinar:
\[ B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Checking the total:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and how the pages are stacked.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.
- Each page is printed on both sides of the paper.

First, calculate the total number of pages in one inch of thickness:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at \( 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \).

4. **Calculate the actual sleep duration:**
   - The actual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - Converting 10 p.m. to 24-hour format: 10 p.m. = 22:00.
   - The actual sleep duration is from 22:00 to 05:55.
   - Converting 05:55 to minutes: \( 5 \times 60 + 55 = 355 \) minutes.
   - The total actual sleep duration is \( 355 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Calculate the sleep on the bed:**
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from the total sleep duration.
   - Total sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time she woke up earlier: 5 minutes.
   - Sleep on the bed: \( 480 - 23 - 5 = 452 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 452 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to:

\[2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups}\]

Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he initially has is:

\[\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}\]

Next, we need to account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro. After giving away 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons}\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups, and now he has 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:

\[24 + 10 = 34\]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[\boxed{34}\]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

This means the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Number of days in 2 weeks} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Emails Sent per Day**: Robyn sends 16 emails a day.

2. **Work Emails**: She sends 7 work emails a day.

3. **Remaining Emails**: Subtract the work emails from the total emails.
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 emails that are not work emails.

4. **Family Emails**: Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   So, she sends 6 emails to her family.

5. **Emails to Boyfriend**: Subtract the family emails from the remaining emails.
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
   So, there are 3 emails that are not to family.

6. **Boyfriend Emails**: One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]
   So, she sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Shawna's age.
2. Use Shawna's age to find out how old Shawna's father is.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 people is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \( 40 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of holes dug by the pirates by the end of the third day, and then use that information to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so net holes dug = 8 - 2 = 6 holes

   Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes.
   - By the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes.
   - Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number that Amora and Lainey each received. Therefore, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

The total number of corn chips can be calculated by summing the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[
70 + 70 + 85
\]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[
70 + 70 = 140
\]
\[
140 + 85 = 225
\]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"

   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance traveled:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's convert the dozens of brownies into individual brownies to make the calculations easier.

- Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself, which is \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office party, which is \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends at the surprise party gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta received:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- Therefore, she gave away a total of \(2 + 2 = 4\) boxes.

Next, we calculate how many boxes she had left after giving some away:

- She started with 12 boxes and gave away 4 boxes.
- So, she had \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:

- She kept 1/4 of the 8 boxes.
- Therefore, she kept \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) boxes.

This means she sold the remaining boxes:

- She had 8 boxes in total and kept 2 boxes.
- So, she sold \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

- \(6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges}\).

The final numerical answer is 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \).

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in India to the number of states in the USA:

\[ S + \left(\frac{1}{2}S + 4\right) = \frac{3}{2}S + 4 \]

However, we need to know the value of \( S \) to get a numerical answer. The problem does not provide the exact number of states in the USA, so we cannot determine a specific numerical answer without additional information. 

If we assume the problem is asking for a general expression or if we are to infer a typical value for the number of states in the USA, we can use the known fact that the USA has 50 states. 

Substituting \( S = 50 \) into the expression:

\[ \frac{3}{2} \times 50 + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

5"
"Let's define the number of cherries Richard has as \( R_r \) and the number of cherries Jerry has as \( R_j \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Robert has 30 cherries, so \( R_r + 10 = 30 \). Solving for \( R_r \), we get \( R_r = 20 \).
2. The total number of cherries is 60, and Robert has 30 cherries, so Richard and Jerry together have \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) cherries.
3. Richard has \( R_r = 20 \) cherries, so Jerry has \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so Robert has \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) more cherries than Jerry.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's define the variables for the number of boxes sold:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so \( G_S = 10 \).
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so \( G_U = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \).
3. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so \( A_U = 15 \).
4. On Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so \( A_U = A_S - 4 \). Given \( A_U = 15 \), we can find \( A_S \) as \( A_S = A_U + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 \).

Now we can calculate the total earnings for both days:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars.
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 19 \times 15 = 285 \) dollars.
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars.
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars.

Adding these up, the total earnings for the two days are:
\[ 60 + 285 + 90 + 225 = 660 \]

So, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is \(\boxed{660}\)."

"To find the cost of the red car, we first calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E \), his dad's current age as \( D \), and his brother's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E = 19 \)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.

First, let's determine the number of years from now when Emil will be 24. This will be:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil's age will be 24, his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \), and his brother's age will be \( B + 5 \).

According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

Next, we know that when Emil is 24, he will be twice the age of his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by each person:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:

\[
20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90
\]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ \text{Number of football players} = 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. This is the total number of students minus the number of football players:

\[ \text{Number of students not football players} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ \text{Number of cheerleaders or band members} = 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early to travel to the away game is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders or band members:

\[ \text{Total number of students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, we have the sizes of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots: 25 and 5, respectively. To find the average size, we add these sizes together and then divide by 2 (since there are two people):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

\[ 15 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 15 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy, calculate the total cost, and then find out how much money Pat will spend.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 30-inch segments can fit into the 1332-inch flower bed:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/segment}} = 44.4 \text{ segments} \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a segment, we take the integer part, which means she can fit 44 segments of 30 inches each into the flower bed. This means she can fit 44 plants (since each segment includes one plant).

Pat already has 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many, we calculate:
\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel intake} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Thus, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Katherine adds 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Katherine adds 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total cost for one basket is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the cost of the sweet potato vines.
  \[
  \text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil remaining, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save for a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp and the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp, then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time to peel and the time to saute:
\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is:

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net temperature change over the entire period.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the time interval between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

Now, we calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
- Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill Check**: He writes a check for the gas bill once per month. So, he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church Check**: He writes a check to the church twice per month. Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: He writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) for pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 such checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \]

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{2}F = 44 \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France. Since the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \), we substitute \( F = 88 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Number of flights to France} = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias's howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Sum the howl durations of all three wolves:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam originally needed $30 for the trousers. With the help of his parents, he received $18. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[A + B + H + W = 20\]
Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
This simplifies to:
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
So,
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]
According to the problem, Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]
Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
So,
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund.
2. Determine the total amount collected from everyone else (excluding the lawyer's contribution).
3. Calculate the lawyer's contribution based on the amount collected from everyone else.

First, let's calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's friend contributed:
\[ 200 \]

Now, we subtract the friend's contribution from the total amount collected to find out how much was collected from everyone else (excluding the lawyer's contribution):
\[ 2000 - 200 = 1800 \]

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \(\boxed{5400}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fraction of the watermelon that each adult and each child gets, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the fraction of the watermelon that each child gets as \( x \). Consequently, each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon.

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total fraction of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total watermelon is considered as 1 (or 100%), we have:
\[ 8x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{8} \]

Each child gets \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) of the watermelon, and each adult gets \( 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the watermelon.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we convert the fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \) to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ 25\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on each task.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = \( 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = \( 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we sum the total time spent on rounds and appointments:
- Total time spent = \( 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:
- Total time spent in hours = \( \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \).

Doctor Jones has 9 hours available for the day at the clinic. We subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total available time:
- Time left to update records = \( 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

The final numerical answer is:

5. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
6. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented \(3 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days/month}\).
7. **Total Earnings per Month**: \( \$40 \text{ per session} \times 12 \text{ sessions/month} = \$480 \).

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **\$480**."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p \).
2. Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m \).

We are given:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the number of gallons \( G \) needed is:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of sticks is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate accordingly.

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students over 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     1500 - 375 = 1125
     \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{1500}{2} = 750
     \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students under 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     1500 - 750 = 750
     \]

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - Sum the female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total number of female students is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final state of the power bank to its initial state.

1. **Final State**: The power bank is at 28% charge after 8 hours (5 hours at 9% loss per hour, then 3 hours at 7% loss per hour).

2. **After 3 Hours**: The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. Let's denote the charge after 3 hours as \( x \). The charge after 3 hours can be calculated as:
   \[
   x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times 0.9303 = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.9303} \approx 0.3014
   \]
   So, the charge after 3 hours was approximately 30.14%.

3. **After 5 Hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. Let's denote the charge after 5 hours as \( y \). The charge after 5 hours can be calculated as:
   \[
   y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = y \times 0.8174 = 0.3014
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{0.3014}{0.8174} \approx 0.3696
   \]
   So, the charge after 5 hours was approximately 36.96%.

4. **Initial State**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, and then loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. Let's denote the initial charge as \( z \). The charge after 5 hours can be calculated as:
   \[
   z \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = z \times 0.8174 = 0.3696
   \]
   Solving for \( z \):
   \[
   z = \frac{0.3696}{0.8174} \approx 0.4524
   \]
   So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 45.24%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total hourly earnings.
3. Calculate the total weekly earnings.
4. Determine the number of weeks needed to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.**

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$10000 = 0.20 \times 10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total hourly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. Therefore, her total hourly earnings are:

\[ \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \text{ per hour} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total weekly earnings.**

Janet works 40 hours a week, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of weeks needed to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000/\text{week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for **2 weeks** to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches is \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars.
- The cost of 4 pears is \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 kiwis is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 apples is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars.

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount of money he has left to spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars.

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy with $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:
\[3\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of pieces in the 13 packs by 10:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack}}{10 \text{ friends}} = \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 5 \) percent
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ A = 120 \left(1 + \frac{5}{100}\right)^3 \]
\[ A = 120 \left(1 + 0.05\right)^3 \]
\[ A = 120 \left(1.05\right)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ A = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ A = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ A \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits.

First, let's find out how many pictures were in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are divided equally among 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

Next, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies is:

\[
\text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

And the number of portraits is:

\[
\text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[
\text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, each small stuffed animal costs $4, so \( S = 4 \). The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( y \). The problem states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( y = 2x \). The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 12x + 4y = 120 \]

Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( y = 2x \), we have:

\[ y = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, let's sum up all the remaining balloons:

\[ \text{Total balloons carried into school} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons carried into school} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension:**
   - Probability that the normal teacher comes in: \(1 - 0.5 = 0.5\)
   - Probability that the normal teacher gives an extension: \(0.4\)
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)

2. **Probability that the normal teacher comes in but does not give an extension:**
   - Probability that the normal teacher comes in: \(0.5\)
   - Probability that the normal teacher does not give an extension: \(1 - 0.4 = 0.6\)
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.6 = 0.3\)

3. **Probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate the assignment:**
   - Probability that the normal teacher comes in: \(0.5\)
   - Probability that the normal teacher does not give an extension: \(0.6\)
   - Probability that Marcus convinces the teacher: \(0.2\)
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.06\)

Now, we sum up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Probability of extension from the normal teacher: \(0.2\)
- Probability of convincing the teacher: \(0.06\)

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[0.2 + 0.06 = 0.26\]

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:
\[1 - 0.26 = 0.74\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[0.74 \times 100 = 74\%\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is \(\boxed{74\%}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950 and for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 available seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway and then calculate the total time it will take him to place the candy in each bottle.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = Total width / Distance between bottles = 24 / 3 = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the total time to place the candy in each bottle:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the second, then to the third, and so on, he will need to make 7 transitions (from bottle 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, ..., from 7 to 8).
   - Total time = Number of transitions * Time per transition = 7 * 5 = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Moishe buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Moishe buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the cost of the mozzarella cheese.
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Moishe starts with $50. To find out how much money he will have left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from his initial amount:
- Money left = \$50 - \$40 = \$10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's education in terms of lost income and then determine how long it would take him to earn that amount.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the lost income during college:**
   - Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
   - During college, he didn't work, so he lost $25,000 a year for 4 years.
   - Total lost income = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost to be earned:**
   - Total cost = Total loan amount + Total lost income = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate the annual income after college:**
   - After college, his income tripled, so he earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

5. **Calculate the number of years it would take to earn $300,000 at $75,000 per year:**
   - Number of years = Total cost / Annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is 4 years."
"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the total area:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

Calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Then add 17 to this amount to find Tuesday's delivery:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

Next, we need to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Calculate twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then add 5 to this amount to find Wednesday's delivery:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. Therefore, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. Therefore, he lost $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.50

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\$21.50}{3} = \$7.1667 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average loss per race is $7.17.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Find the total number of hours worked by each painter.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.**

There are 3 weeks of work, and each week has 7 days. Therefore, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.**

Each day, the team of 4 painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all painters in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Find the total number of hours worked by each painter.**

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{\frac{63}{8} \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = \frac{63}{8 \times 4} \text{ hours/painter} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours/painter} \]

To convert \(\frac{63}{32}\) hours into a decimal:
\[ \frac{63}{32} = 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours of work each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{1.96875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To calculate the annual cost James has to pay for insurance after the 60% increase, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost:
   - The normal monthly cost is $120.
   - The increase is 60% of $120.
   - 60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72.
   - Therefore, the increased monthly cost = $120 + $72 = $192.

2. Calculate the annual cost:
   - The increased monthly cost is $192.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - The annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304.

So, the final numerical answer is $2304."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg uses 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg uses 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
  \]

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
\[
2 \text{ loads (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ load (king size bed)} = 3 \text{ loads}
\]

Since Greg does this every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
\[

   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. **This year**: Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he had 150 stickers last year, this year he collected:
   \[
   2 \times 150 = 300
   \]
   Therefore, the number of stickers he has this year is:
   \[
   150 + 300 = 450
   \]

So, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

So, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices Jake and Silvia ate based on the information given, and then sum the slices eaten by all three.

First, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ B = J + 3 \]
Since \( B = 10 \), we can substitute and solve for \( J \):
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Let's denote the number of slices Silvia ate as \( S \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ S = 2J \]
Since \( J = 7 \), we can substitute and solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 14 \]
So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. We know that each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
The total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia is the sum of the slices each of them ate:
\[ B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to sum up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we sum these amounts to get the total cost of the doctor's visit:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \]

The total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that don't require any response per day.
2. Calculate the number of emails that require a response per day.
3. Multiply the number of emails that require a response per day by the number of days in a 5-day work week.

First, let's find out how many emails don't require any response per day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80 emails:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

So, 16 emails don't require any response per day. This means the rest of the emails require a response. We can find the number of emails that require a response per day by subtracting the emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

So, James responds to 64 emails per day. Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes visited.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes visited.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:
\[
\boxed{247}

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many they have left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many they have left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, we add the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony is sending.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony is sending 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the small and big coupons to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney originally ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate some is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after her additional order is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks.

First, we know that Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks that failed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]
This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Dennis will spend on butter given the promotion and the unit pricing.

First, calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \) of butter.

Next, consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
- Under the promotion, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays for 1 pound and gets the second pound at half price.

Let's break down the cost:
- For the first 2 pounds, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.
- For the next 2 pounds, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.
- For the last 2 pounds, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.

Calculate the cost for each 2-pound segment:
- Cost for the first 2 pounds: \( 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \)
- Cost for the next 2 pounds: \( 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \)
- Cost for the last 2 pounds: \( 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \)

Summing up the costs for all 6 pounds:
- Total cost = \( \$6.00 + \$6.00 + \$6.00 = \$18.00 \)

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{18.00}

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 20 guests are already covered by the base fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 guests (41 - 20 = 21).

The cost for the additional guests is:
- $6 per guest * 21 guests = $126.

Adding the base rental fee to the additional cost:
- Base rental fee = $125
- Additional cost = $126

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{251}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie had $60 initially. She spent a quarter of her money, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]
dollars left.

Riza also had $60 initially. She spent one-third of her money, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
dollars left.

Now, to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas eaten by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each and she bought 15 roses, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. The florist will give her change in quarters. To find out how many quarters she will receive, we need to determine how many quarters make up the additional $5. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:
\[ 5 \div 0.25 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (125 minutes).

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes).
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine how long Paul waits for his train. Paul arrives at the station at the time the fourth train arrives, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait from 10 minutes to 145 minutes.

Thus, the time Paul waits is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If Melanie continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The discount percentage is calculated based on the original price of the watch.
\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Discount Percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(10\%\).

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Since every second, a single spring creates one new jellyfish, the rate of jellyfish creation per spring is 1 jellyfish per second.

2. **Calculate the total number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."

"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to consider both the trip to the halfway point and the return trip.

1. **Distance to the halfway point:**
   - The total distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles.
   - Halfway is therefore \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Time to walk to the halfway point:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - Time taken to walk 2 miles is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Time to walk back home:**
   - The distance back is also 2 miles.
   - Time taken to walk back 2 miles is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to walk to the halfway point and the time to walk back home.

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

The cost of each bunch is $3.00, and Jenny buys 10 bunches. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, the total amount of fence is 100 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. This gives us the following system of equations:

\[
S + H = 100
\]
\[
H = S + 60
\]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]
\[
S = 20
\]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we note that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, which means Harry gets \( 20 + 60 = 80 \) feet. Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is:

\[
100 - 80 = 20
\]

Thus, the amount left over for Sam is \(\boxed{20}\) feet."

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings from all types of bikes.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold \(\times\) Price of a Trekking bike = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold \(\times\) Price of a BMX bike = \( 45 \times \frac{500}{2} = 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold \(\times\) Price of an MTB bike = \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes = \( 67500 + 11250 + 32500 = 111250 \)

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay in the field after 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer will make:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

The net number of bales of hay in the field after 6 hours is the number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time each day is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total extra learning time each week:**
   - John spends 100 minutes each day on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the total extra learning time each week is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 200 = 1800\) minutes.

7. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week in hours is \(\frac{1800}{60} = 30\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, so the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child who is 6 feet tall is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of the remaining meat, leaving \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda when she takes 1 soda from the remaining 8 sodas.

First, let's determine the number of sodas in each category after Ellen's actions:
- Ellen shook 3 sodas, so there are 3 shaken sodas left.
- Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so there are 11 sodas left in total, with 10 unshaken and 1 shaken.

Next, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 8 unshaken sodas

Now, Ellen's friend takes 1 soda from the remaining 8 sodas. We need to find the probability that this soda is a shaken soda.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

\[
\text{Number of people in buses} = 12 \times 35
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[
12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420

So, there are 420 people in the buses.

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

\[
\text{Number of people in cars} = 20 \times 3
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

So, there are 60 people in the cars.

Finally, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest slide: 60 feet/minute

\[
\text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length of the biggest slide}}{\text{Speed of the biggest slide}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest slide: 80 feet/minute

\[
\text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length of the second biggest slide}}{\text{Speed of the second biggest slide}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time for the biggest slide} - \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's determine how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Out of this $14, she has already spent $4. So, the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, we first calculate 20% of last year's enrollment and then add that to last year's total.

1. Calculate 20% of 50 students:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

2. Add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60.

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

**Initial number of fishes:**
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

**Number of fishes bought:**
- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppy: 1
- Additional male goldfishes: 2
- Additional female goldfishes: 3

**Total number of each type of fish after the purchase:**
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: \(6 + 5 = 11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8 + 8 = 16\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes:
- Difference: \(16 - 11 = 5\)

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \( 4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \).
   - Let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption given the problem's phrasing).

Now, we sum up the total time taken by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time:**
   John drives for 2 hours one way.

2. **Determine the speed:**
   The speed is given as 70 mph.

3. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   Since the trip is a round trip, the total distance is twice the one-way distance.
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 2 \times 140 \text{ miles} = 280 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is:
\[

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is:
\[12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

However, we calculated that the first 4 workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the additional toys needed to reach the total of 400 toys. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The fifth worker worked for a 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[\frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}\]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{20}\) toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah's and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the information given and then sum them up with Kory's dog weight.

First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's dog (one-fourth of Kory's dog)} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's dog (half of Kory's dog)} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we sum the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob. Before giving these 7 stickers to Rob, Kris had 7 + 7 = 14 stickers.
2. Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris after using half of his. Since Kris had 14 stickers before giving some to Rob, Luis must have given Kris 14 stickers. This means Luis had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers before using half of them.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 28 stickers, Seth must have had 28 * 2 = 56 stickers before giving half to Luis.

Therefore, Seth had 56 stickers in the beginning.

\[
\boxed{56}

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the M&Ms is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. We know that each ounce contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to pack these M&Ms into small bags with 10 M&Ms in each bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it takes Alfie to fly that distance.

First, we calculate half of the circumference of the earth:
\[
\text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car's speed is given as 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
     \[
     120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the faster car:**
   - The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
     \[
     600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph}
     \]

So, the speed of the faster car is **750 mph**."
"To solve this problem, let's set up a linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago Liam was 14 years old (since Liam is currently 16 years old). At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find Vince's age two years ago, we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ V_{\text{current}} = 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( A = M \) (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. \( C + S = 30 \) (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. \( C = S + 12 \) (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)
4. \( A + M + C + S = 56 \) (The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56)

First, we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) and \( C \) with \( S + 12 \) in the total equation:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( A + S = 22 \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = 22 - A \]

Substitute \( S = 22 - A \) into the second equation:
\[ C + (22 - A) = 30 \]
\[ C = 8 + A \]

Now we know:
\[ A = M \]
\[ C = 8 + A \]
\[ S = 22 - A \]

We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = (8 + A) - A = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box will weigh:

\[ 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces/box} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} \]

Now, since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{12.5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since 80% of the tree can be turned into logs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Length of logs} = 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Each of these logs is then cut into 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks is:

\[ \text{Total planks} = 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2. Thus, the total revenue from selling all the planks is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( v_b \) be Grandma's speed on the beach in miles per minute.
- Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk \( v_s \) is \( 2v_b \).

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is given as 40 minutes. We can use this information to find \( v_b \).

The time spent on the beach is given by:
\[ \text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Speed on beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v_b} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]
From this, we can solve for \( v_b \):
\[ v_b = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can find the speed on the sidewalk:
\[ v_s = 2v_b = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much Jane has already saved and how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

Jane has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. Therefore, the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane continues to save $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add up the birds from each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, we add these amounts together:

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( x \) degrees.

Initially, Donny has two mugs of water: one at 33 degrees and one at \( x \) degrees. After pouring 4 ounces of the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug, the temperature of the water in his water bottle is such that he can drink it, which means it must be at least 40 degrees.

The average temperature of the water in his water bottle after the mix can be calculated as follows:

The total temperature of the water poured into the water bottle is \( 4 \times 33 + 1 \times x = 132 + x \).

The total volume of water poured into the water bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The average temperature of the water in the water bottle is then:
\[
\frac{132 + x}{5}
\]

Since this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees, we set up the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[
132 + x \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:
\[
x \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then sum them up.

Initially, the farm has:
- 50 cows
- 20 chickens

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Over three weeks (21 days), the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Over three weeks (21 days), the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

After three weeks, the total number of cows on the farm is:
\[ 50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ cows added} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

And the total number of chickens on the farm is:
\[ 20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"To find out the cost of each single bagel after Russell orders 4 packs with a 10% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 4 packs without the discount:**
   Each pack costs $10.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost with discount} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}

4. **Calculate the total number of bagels:**
   Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per bagel after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

So, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve step by step.

First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
Thus, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, we calculate:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
Thus, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 18 scoops is 9 times 2 scoops (because 18 = 9 * 2), we need 9 times the number of potatoes required for 2 scoops. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
Thus, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we need to break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Adding the eggs consumed over the two periods gives:
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen}

Tim has 5 trees, so the total number of lemons collected from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 3: Number of lemons from all trees in a decade.
A decade is 10 years, so the total number of lemons collected from all trees in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold by Faraday over 3 days. We know the following:

1. The price of a single sunflower is $2.
2. The price of a bouquet of sunflowers is $8.
3. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
4. Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
5. Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.
6. We need to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. Since each sunflower is sold for $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day can be calculated by dividing the daily earnings from sunflowers by the price of one sunflower:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet is sold for $8, the number of bouquets sold per day can be calculated by dividing the daily earnings from bouquets by the price of one bouquet:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7
\]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from sunflowers and the sunflowers sold from bouquets:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

\[
\boxed{291}
\]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy:**
   Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam sells:**
   Adam sells 60% of his inventory.
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks:**
   Each rock is sold for $7.
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the rocks Adam bought:**
   Each rock costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 20 \times 5 = 100
   \]

5. **Calculate the loss:**
   The loss is the difference between the cost of the rocks and the revenue from selling them.
   \[
   \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16
   \]

Therefore, Adam loses \(\boxed{16}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum these times.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**

     \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Total medium-sized picture scenes needed: 36.
   - Time required for medium-sized picture scenes: 
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Total small-sized picture scenes needed: 49.
   - Time required for small-sized picture scenes: 
     \[
     \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
     \]

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for each ticket.

For the first ticket, the probability of winning is given as 20%, or 0.20.

For the second ticket, it is stated that it is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:

"Let's define the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as \( C \), \( J \), and \( R \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we find \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of one person, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
- For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Next, we calculate how many more bottles are needed:
- The company currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The additional number of bottles needed is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

So, the number of additional bottles Hortex would have to produce is 7300.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break down the information given:

- Carla has 8 octuplets.
- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, which means \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies are dressed in purple.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue, which means \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies are dressed in blue.
- All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple-wearers (1/3 of 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

We need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows.

The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2. The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

Converting this to a percentage, we get \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

"Let's denote the amount of money given to Ronnie as \( R \) and the amount given to Rissa as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 3R \).

Let's assume each of them gave the same amount of money, say \( x \), to their little sister. After giving \( x \) to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ S - x = \frac{4}{5}S \]
Substituting \( S = 3R \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R - x = \frac{4}{5}(3R) \]
\[ 3R - x = \frac{12R}{5} \]
To isolate \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ x = 3R - \frac{12R}{5} \]
\[ x = \frac{15R}{5} - \frac{12R}{5} \]
\[ x = \frac{3R}{5} \]

Now, since Ronnie gave \( x \) to their sister, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[ R - x = R - \frac{3R}{5} = \frac{5R}{5} - \frac{3R}{5} = \frac{2R}{5} \]

Since \( R \) is the amount of money given to Ronnie, and we need to find the final numerical answer, we can assume \( R = 5 \) (since the problem does not specify the exact amount but uses a ratio, and \( R = 5 \) makes the calculations straightforward):
\[ \frac{2R}{5} = \frac{2 \times 5}{5} = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

2. **Determine the distribution of paint:**
   - The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
   - There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
   - Half the mural is yellow.

3. **Assign variables to the parts:**
   Let \( R \) represent the amount of red paint.
   Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \), and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).
   The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   The total amount of paint is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
   \[
   R + R + R + 6 = 12
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3R + 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Solve for \( R \):**
   Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   3R = 6
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   R = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we can find the total area of the house by summing the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. Since the special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we calculate the number of pods in the special size box as follows:

1. Calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

2. Add this to the original number of pods to find the total number of pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run with $1 if each cycle uses 1 pod. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the number of pods by the cost per pod:

3. Calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ cycles per dollar} \]

Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of cycles that can be run with $1 is:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

After that, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

When he triples this amount, he has:

\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

4. **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams: \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[16\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it is less than 2 inches, given that he has already used 45% of it by the end of Monday.

First, let's calculate the amount of chalk used by the end of Monday:
- The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
- He used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.

The amount of chalk used by Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the amount of chalk remaining by the end of Monday is:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using only 20% of the remaining chalk each day before it is less than 2 inches.

Let \( x \) be the number of days the teacher can continue using the chalk. Each day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk. So, the amount of chalk remaining after \( x \) days can be expressed as:
\[ 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20)^x = 2.75 \times (0.80)^x \]

We need to find the smallest \( x \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches:
\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^x < 2 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2.75:
\[ (0.80)^x < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.80)^x < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273 \]

Now, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ \ln((0.80)^x) < \ln(0.7273) \]
\[ x \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.7273) \]

Since \(\ln(0.80)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.80)\) and reverse the inequality:
\[ x > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.80)} \]

Calculating the logarithms:
\[ \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.310 \]
\[ \ln(0.80) \approx -0.223 \]

So,
\[ x > \frac{-0.310}{-0.223} \approx 1.39 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

- Number of girls on varsity: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\)
- Number of boys on varsity: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\)

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity: \(12 - 4 = 8\)
- Number of boys not on varsity: \(12 - 3 = 9\)

Finally, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity to find the total number of students not on varsity.

- Total number of students not on varsity: \(8 + 9 = 17\)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of teeth capped by the dentist.
2. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed.
3. Find the percentage of James' teeth that are fixed.

First, we know that the dentist drills 4 teeth. The number of teeth capped is 7 more than the number of teeth drilled. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth fixed by adding the number of teeth drilled and the number of teeth capped:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage 15 teeth is of James' total 30 teeth. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{number of teeth fixed}}{\text{total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. So, the amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the refund amount is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how much it costs to buy one book, we divide $500 by 100:

\[
\frac{500}{100} = 5
\]

So, each book costs $5.

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27000. We do this by dividing $27000 by the cost of one book:

\[
\frac{27000}{5} = 5400
\]

Bob can buy 5400 books in total.

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
1800

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the 1 apple on his head and the other apple that fell out, making a total of 2 apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
4. Now, Newton has 5 apples (the 2 he picked up plus the 3 that fell out). He picked up these 5 apples, put 4 in his pocket and threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
5. Now, Newton has 11 apples (the 4 he picked up plus the 7 that fell out). He picked up all of these 11 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 11.

"To determine the total cost of Ali's order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed to make up 850 kg of coal.
2. Determine the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags required:
\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza consumed by her 6 friends.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each friend eats 6 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Total slices of cheese pizza eaten = \(6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each friend eats 4 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Total slices of pepperoni pizza eaten = \(4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required to meet these totals.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total slices needed = 36.
- Number of cheese pizzas required = \(\lceil \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} \rceil = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total slices needed = 24.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas required = \(\lceil \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} \rceil = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas and both types require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can effectively build over time, accounting for the snowballs that melt.

First, let's find out how many snowballs Jay can build in 15 minutes. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour (60 minutes), in 15 minutes he can build:
\[ \frac{20}{60} \times 15 = 5 \text{ snowballs} \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net number of snowballs Jay can build in 15 minutes is:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he builds 3 snowballs per 15 minutes, the number of 15-minute intervals needed to build 60 snowballs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ intervals} \]

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since 20 years have passed since the series came out, we add 20 years to Jim's age at that time to find his current age.

Therefore, Jim's current age is \( 14 + 20 = 34 \) years old.

The final numerical answer is 34."

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of bandages used and ordered each day, and then determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38 - 10 = 28
   - Bandages ordered: 0 (no bulk pack ordered)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
   - Bandages used: \(100 / 2 = 50\) bandages
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 50 + 100 = 72\)

However, the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This discrepancy suggests a need to recheck the initial conditions or the problem statement. Given the problem's constraints, let's assume the initial number of bandages is \(x\).

From the end of the first day, they had 50 bandages. On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages. On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used 50, so they had \(22 + 100 - 50 = 72\) bandages. Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, we need to adjust our initial number of bandages.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\). After the first day, they had \(x - 38 + 50 = x + 12\) bandages. After the second day, they had \(x + 12 - 28 = x - 16\) bandages. After the third day, they had \(x - 16 + 100 - 50 = x + 34\) bandages. Given they had 78 bandages left, we set up the equation:
\[x + 34 = 78\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 34 = 44\]

So, the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{44}\)."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider both the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut.

The cost of the hair color is $40.

The length of hair cut is from 10 inches to 8 inches, which is a reduction of 2 inches. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

Adding the cost of the hair color and the haircut together, we get:
\[40 + 60 = 100\]

So, the total cost for the hair cut and color is $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular earnings from her hourly rate and her bonus for complete attendance.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Weekly earnings from hourly rate:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives a $10 bonus for complete attendance each week.

Weekly bonus:
\[ \$10 \]

Total weekly earnings:
\[ \$67.5 + \$10 = \$77.5 \]

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for April:
- There are 4 weeks in April.

   - Twice 40 = 2 * 40 = 80 people.
   - Total after 10:00 = 90 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) = 170 people.

4. **Entry by evening:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - 3 times 50 = 3 * 50 = 150 people.
   - Total by evening = 170 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320 people.

Now, we sum up all the entries to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

Thus, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is:

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

Next, we calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
- Since there are 5 packs of red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ packs}\).
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is \(10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ pens}\).

Finally, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
- Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
- Total number of pens = \(25 \text{ pens} + 50 \text{ pens} = 75 \text{ pens}\).

So, the total number of pens Alain has is 75."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of bottles of cognac John buys:**
   John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cognac:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of everything:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of trees planted on the first day.**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the first day is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of trees planted on the second day.**
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.
- The total number of trees planted on the second day is \(30 + 50 = 80\).

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days.**
- The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted on the first day and the second day, which is \(60 + 80 = 140\).

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. The selling price is given as \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the cost price.

First, we calculate the selling price:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
\]

To simplify the multiplication:
\[
\frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
\]

We can simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factors. Notice that 72 can be divided by 8:
\[
\frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
\]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is:
\[

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the medium setting as on the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the high setting as on the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by dividing the capacity of Ali's class by 8:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   \[
   \text{Cost for first 16 minutes} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute.
   \[
   \text{Cost for remaining 20 minutes} = 20 \times 0.2 = 4.00
   \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for the 36-minute call.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

This means the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined is 10:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Next, we calculate the total cost of both services without any discounts:

\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if both services are purchased together. We need to calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the services:

\[ \text{Total cost with nail art} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the final amount Karen would pay is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues she receives from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. So, the total number of issues from these 3 magazines is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, the total number of issues from this magazine is:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, the total number of issues from this magazine is:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of issues from all the magazines:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price increases by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December is $72. A 50% decrease means the price decreases by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. He has 4 such lessons:

\[
4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80/\text{lesson} = \$320
\]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans. The rate for veteran lessons is 25% less than the standard rate. Therefore, the reduced rate is:

\[
\$80 - (0.25 \times \$80) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60/\text{lesson}
\]

Charlie has 2 veteran lessons:

\[
2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60/\text{lesson} = \$120
\]

Now, we sum the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

\[
\$320 + \$120 = \$440
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[
\boxed{440}

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum the scores**: Add all the scores together.
2. **Count the scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sum the scores**:
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

   So, the sum of the scores is \(630\).

2. **Count the scores**: There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{630}{9} = 70
   \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we start by noting that Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount. Therefore, the number of pomelos she has left is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

\[
\text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
\]

Next, we calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 of them.

\[
\text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36
\]

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We need to find 25% of 36.

\[
\text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9
\]

Now, we calculate the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister.

\[
\text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. We need to find the total amount of money he received.

\[
\text{Total money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, then:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Number of novels this year} \]

Let's denote the number of novels she has written this year as \( N \). Then we have:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times N \]

To solve for \( N \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ N = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ N = 3 \times 4 \]

\[ N = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to determine the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Given:
- Michael's average speed = 50 km/hr
- Time traveled = 3 days
- Total distance between Alaska and Texas = 6000 km

First, convert the time traveled into hours:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Distance traveled} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, calculate the percentage of the total distance that has been covered:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is \(60\%\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used.
2. Calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother.
3. Determine how many grapes were left after they used some.
4. Calculate the total number of grapes used to make the pies.
5. Add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the pies to find the initial number of grapes.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

2. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. The number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used some is:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of grapes} - 36
   \]

4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

5. Since the number of grapes used to make the pies is 48, and this is the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used some, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of grapes} - 36 = 48
   \]
   Solving for the initial number of grapes:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of grapes} = 48 + 36 = 84
   \]

So, the initial number of grapes is:
\[
\boxed{84}

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   Bud spends $1.00 on pasta each week.

2. **Cost of Cheese:**
   - Cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week.
   - Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) per week.

3. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   Adding the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
   \]
   So, Bud spends $10.00 each week on making macaroni and cheese.

4. **Yearly Cost:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year, so the yearly cost is:
   \[
   10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
   \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

\[
\boxed{520.00}

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms and then determine what percentage of an 8-hour day is spent on this task.

First, calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms:
- There are 80 classrooms.
- It takes 15 minutes per classroom.
- Total time required = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Next, convert the total time required into hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total time in hours = 1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours.

Now, calculate the percentage of an 8-hour day spent cleaning:
- Total time required = 20 hours.
- Time in an 8-hour day = 8 hours.
- Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 2500%.

However, this percentage seems incorrect because it exceeds 100%. This indicates that the custodian is working more than one full 8-hour day to complete the task. To find the average percentage of the day spent cleaning, we need to consider the time spent per day and the total time required.

Since the custodian works 5 days to complete the task, we can calculate the average time spent per day:
- Total time required = 20 hours.
- Number of days = 5.
- Average time per day = 20 hours / 5 days = 4 hours/day.

Now, calculate the percentage of an 8-hour day spent cleaning:
- Average time per day = 4 hours.
- Time in an 8-hour day = 8 hours.
- Percentage of day spent cleaning = (4 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the capacity of each shelf and then calculate the total number of shelves Elly needs to store all 110 books.

1. **Middle shelves capacity:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves.
   - Total capacity of middle shelves = \( 10 \text{ books/shelf} \times 2 \text{ shelves} = 20 \text{ books} \).

2. **Bottom shelf capacity:**
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Capacity of the bottom shelf = \( 2 \times 10 \text{ books} = 20 \text{ books} \).

3. **Top shelf capacity:**
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Capacity of the top shelf = \( 20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books} \).

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Total capacity = Capacity of middle shelves + Capacity of bottom shelf + Capacity of top shelf
   - Total capacity = \( 20 \text{ books} + 20 \text{ books} + 15 \text{ books} = 55 \text{ books} \).

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00
\]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. This can be written as:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and they have 2 flashlights per room.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 2 \times 8 = 4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- For the 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- For the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs in the changing room, and then find the total number of items.

We are given:
- There are 20 helmets.
- There are half as many robots as helmets.
- There are half as many helmets as footballs.

First, let's find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets:
\[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, let's find the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets:
\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. Since half of the 200 yards is on land and the other half is in water, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{hop}} \) to hop 100 yards is given by:
\[
t_{\text{hop}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His speed in water is 10 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{swim}} \) to swim 100 yards is given by:
\[
t_{\text{swim}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time \( t_{\text{total}} \) for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{hop}} + t_{\text{swim}} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is:
\[
\boxed{15}

1. Calculate the number of boxes Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and then sum up the costs of all the phones.

1. **Identify the cost of the main phone:**
   The main phone costs $20.

2. **Determine the cost of each additional phone:**
   The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Let the cost of each additional phone be \( x \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   20 = 2x
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   So, each additional phone costs $10.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the additional phones:**
   There are 4 additional phones, each costing $10. Therefore, the total cost for the additional phones is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40
   \]

4. **Sum the costs of the main phone and the additional phones:**
   The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the total cost of the additional phones:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Convert the total number of doughnuts into a total number of units (since 1 dozen = 12 units).
3. Calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of units by the price per unit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, we first find the number of doughnuts made in one day:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Now, for 30 days:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Convert the total number of doughnuts into a total number of units.**

Since 1 dozen = 12 units, 120 doughnuts = 10 units. Therefore, 3600 doughnuts = \( \frac{3600}{12} = 300 \) units.

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.**

The price per unit is $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ units} \times 2 \text{ dollars/unit} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

Here's the breakdown of the weekly cost:
- Cost for 5 blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for 1 skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair of pants} = \$16.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total weekly cost:
\[
\$25.00 + \$6.00 + \$16.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost over 5 weeks:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people for each day and then use the given average to find the total.

1. **First Day:**
   Conor saw 50 people.

2. **Second Day:**
   The number of people on the second day was 20 more than on the first day.
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   The number of people on the third day was twice the number on the second day.
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Fourth Day to Sunday:**
   We know the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) is 60 people per day. Since there are 4 days in this period, the total number of people seen over these days is:
   \[
   60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people}

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces that Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then account for the additional popping from residual heat.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: 20

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\)

Now, we sum the number of kernels that popped in the first three intervals:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the additional popping from residual heat. According to the problem, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Adding this to the initial count:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of lemons Tim will need to make 4 gallons of lemonade, with one gallon being twice as tart as the others.

First, let's calculate the number of lemons needed for the 3 regular gallons of lemonade:
- For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 1 gallon (1 cup) of lemonade, Tim needs 6 lemons.
- Therefore, for 3 gallons (3 cups), Tim needs \(3 \times 6 = 18\) lemons.

Next, let's calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon of lemonade:
- The extra gallon is twice as tart as the regular gallons, but the amount of lemon juice needed remains the same (1 cup).
- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 1 cup of lemon juice, Tim still needs 6 lemons.

Adding the lemons needed for the 3 regular gallons and the extra gallon:
- Total lemons needed = 18 (for 3 gallons) + 6 (for the extra gallon) = 24 lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so it is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is \( 20 \).

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled west first and then east, the net distance from his starting point is the difference between the distance he traveled east and the distance he traveled west:
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Initially, Dallas has 21 marbles. After dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \text{ marbles} \]

This means that the 17 marbles that Dallas has now are the marbles he received from Mazie plus the 7 marbles he originally had (since he dropped 4 out of his original 17). Therefore, the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie is:

\[ 17 - 7 = 10 \text{ marbles} \]

Mazie initially had 52 marbles. After giving 10 marbles to Dallas, the number of marbles Mazie has left is:

\[ 52 - 10 = 42 \text{ marbles} \]

Since the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is 52, and Dallas received 10 marbles, Darla must have received:

First, let's determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, each pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:
- Since there are five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds per day.

Now, we calculate the weekly feed consumption:
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed initially. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the weekly feed consumption from the initial amount:
- The amount of feed left after a week is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs:

\[
20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[
40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs are required. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so the number of packs needed is:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs}
\]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[
6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, the total revenue from selling the cupcakes and cookies is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies. Each tray costs $4:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the pattern of how the number of children increases on each street.

1. **First Street:** The truck starts with 5 children.
2. **Second Street:** Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street:** Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the 30 children that are following the truck.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[25\]"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the initial number of meals she had.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given on Friday: 64
- Meals given on Saturday: 30
- Meals given on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals:
Initial number of meals = 1,360
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin to its equivalent value in cents and then sum them up.

3. **Total Age of All Siblings:**
   - Total age of all siblings = Total age of the sisters + Total age of the brothers = \(48 + 36 = 84\) years.

The total age of all the siblings is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Meditation Time:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
   - Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
   - Since she meditates 5 days a week, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

2. **Yoga Time:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
   - Weekly yoga time = 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks = Total meditation time + Total yoga time = 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks is **30 hours**."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum these values.

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, the small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in the large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal.
- For the first T-shirt, the price remains $8.
- For the second T-shirt, the price is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.
- Therefore, the final price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."

"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

1. **Passion fruit cost:**
   - 1 jar requires 2 pounds of passion fruit.
   - Passion fruit costs $6 per pound.
   - Cost of passion fruit per jar = \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12 \).

2. **Jackfruit cost:**
   - 1 jar requires 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.
   - Jackfruit costs $8 per pound.
   - Cost of jackfruit per jar = \( 1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12 \).

3. **Special honey cost:**
   - 1 jar requires 2 pounds of special honey.
   - Honey costs $10 per pound.
   - Cost of honey per jar = \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20 \).

Next, we add up the costs of all the ingredients to find the total cost per jar:

\[
\text{Total cost per jar} = \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 jars} = 10 \times \$44 = \$440
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 10 \times \$50 = \$500
\]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = \$500 - \$440 = \$60
\]

Thus, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in one week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in one week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings in 2 weeks.

First, let's find out how many days Josh works in one week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works on 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in one week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over the period Nate is away and then determine how long it takes to fill them all.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug = \(6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\).

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over the period Nate is away:
- Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day, but Nate fills in 9 holes per day.
- Net change per day = \(9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of days it takes to fill in all the holes:
- Total holes = 84.
- Net change per day = 3 holes.
- Total days to fill = \(\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}\).

Finally, we convert the total days into weeks:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total weeks = \(\frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}\).

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( T \) be the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
- Let \( B \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
- Let \( P \) be the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, so \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \).
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered the correct number, so \( B = 7 \).
4. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

We can now set up the equation for the total number of items:
\[ T + B + P = 29 \]

Substituting the values of \( T \), \( B \), and \( P \) into the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 29 \]

This confirms that the total number of items is indeed 29. Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers (7), the number of beakers he lost is:
\[ 7 - 7 = 0 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{0}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \(A\) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(D_A\) and the distance Vanessa ran as \(D_V\). We know that \(D_V = 4\) miles. The distance Aaron ran can be expressed as:
\[ D_A = \frac{A \times 16}{V} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \(A\) miles per minute, the time it took Aaron to run his distance is:
\[ 16 = \frac{D_A}{A} = \frac{\frac{A \times 16}{V}}{A} = \frac{16}{V} \]
From this, we can solve for \(V\):
\[ V = 1 \text{ mile per minute} \]
Since \(A = 2V\), we have:
\[ A = 2 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Since her speed is 1 mile per minute, the time \(T_V\) it took her to run 4 miles is:
\[ T_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per minute}} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The dock is 200 feet long.
- He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Therefore, the total line required for the dock is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line required:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's determine the number of reservations per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.

Next, we calculate the total number of reservations per day:
- Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total number of reservations per day is \(6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/day} = 12 \text{ reservations/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of reservations per week:
- Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total number of reservations per week is \(12 \text{ reservations/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ reservations/week}\).

Each reservation results in:
- 2 meals at $5 each, which totals \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

So, the total revenue per reservation is:
- \(10 \text{ dollars (meals)} + 5 \text{ dollars (wine)} = 15 \text{ dollars/reservation}\).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue for the week:
- \(24 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 360 \text{ dollars/week}\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.
2. Divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons to find the price per watermelon.

First, let's calculate the total selling price. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80. The profit can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:

\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon. Since the total selling price is $100 for 50 watermelons, the price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine James's current age. We know that Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old. Since James is currently twice as old as Dora, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to determine how old John is now. We know that when John had James, he was 19 years old. Since James is currently 18 years old, John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Therefore, John's youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):

- In one hour, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:

\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \]

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discounted price is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:

\[ \text{Mechanic Cost} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4w = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2w = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2w = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2w - c - w = 15 \]
\[ w = 15 \]

Now that we know \( w = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
