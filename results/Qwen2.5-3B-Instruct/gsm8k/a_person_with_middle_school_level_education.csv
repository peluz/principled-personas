"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. Janet bakes muffins with 4 eggs every day.
4. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

To find out how many eggs are left for sale, we subtract the eggs eaten and used for muffins from the total eggs laid:

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs eaten} - \text{Eggs used for muffins} \]

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = 16 - 3 - 4 \]

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = 9 \]

Now, Janet sells each fresh egg for $2 at the farmers' market. So, to find out how much she makes every day, we multiply the number of eggs left for sale by the price per egg:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Eggs left for sale} \times \text{Price per egg} \]

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 9 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, if the blue fiber is 2 bolts, then the white fiber would be half of that, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.
3. To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together: 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 3.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's find out the new value of the house after Josh made the repairs and increased its value by 150%.

The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh added $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increased by 150%. To find out how much the value increased, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Now, to find out the profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost of the house and the repairs from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 195,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 195,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many meters James runs in one sprint. According to the question, he runs 60 meters in one sprint.

2. Next, we need to find out how many meters he runs in one day. Since he runs 3 sprints each day, we multiply the number of meters in one sprint by the number of sprints he runs each day:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/day} = 180 \text{ meters/day}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many meters he runs in one week. Since he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the number of meters he runs in one day by the number of days he runs each week:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of each type of glass:**
   - The first glass costs $5.
   - Every second glass costs 60% of $5. So, we calculate 60% of $5:
     \[
     0.60 \times 5 = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, every second glass costs $3.

2. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The first glass costs $5.
   - The second glass costs $3.
   - The third glass costs $5.
   - The fourth glass costs $3.
   - And so on.

3. **Count the total number of glasses:**
   - Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.

4. **Group the glasses into pairs:**
   - Since every second glass costs $3, we can group the glasses into pairs of one $5 glass and one $3 glass.
   - In 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

5. **Calculate the cost for one pair:**
   - One pair consists of one $5 glass and one $3 glass.
   - The cost for one pair is:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8
     \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for 8 pairs:**
   - Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
     \[
     8 \times 8 = 64
     \]

So, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep each city has:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has 160 sheep.

So, the total number of sheep is \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\).

The final numerical answer is 260."
"First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. The file is 200 GB in total, and she has downloaded 40% of it before the restart.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 200 \text{ GB} = 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

So, she has downloaded 80 GB before the restart. Now, let's calculate how much she has left to download after the restart.

\[ 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \]

Next, we need to account for the 20 minutes it takes to restart the download. During this time, she doesn't download any data. So, we need to subtract this time from the total time she has to download the remaining 120 GB.

Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute. To find out how long it takes to download 120 GB at this speed:

\[ \text{Time to download 120 GB} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the restart takes 20 minutes, the actual time she has to download the remaining 120 GB is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can calculate how much data she can download in 40 minutes at her normal speed:

\[ \text{Data downloaded in 40 minutes} = 2 \text{ GB/minute} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

So, the total data downloaded is the 80 GB she had already downloaded plus the 80 GB she downloaded after the restart:

\[ 80 \text{ GB} + 80 \text{ GB} = 160 \text{ GB} \]

Therefore, the total load to download the file is 160 GB."
"First, let's break down the journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time for the fourth segment = 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances from all segments to find the total distance John has traveled.

Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and then for the additional 5 hours as overtime.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours:
- Her regular hourly rate is $10.
- So, for 40 hours, her earnings are \(40 \times 10 = 400\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
- Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is \(10 \times 1.2 = 12\) dollars per hour.
- So, for 5 hours of overtime, her earnings are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
- Total earnings = \(400 + 60 = 460\) dollars.

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are 460 dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Now, we add the downloads from all three months.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68. So, the cost for the donuts is:
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80. So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55. So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

So, the total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost per year and compare it to the revenue he gets from selling lemons.

First, let's calculate the total cost per year:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and he sells each lemon for $1.5.

The revenue from selling lemons each year is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Now, let's add the initial cost to the annual cost to find the total cost per year:
\[ \$90 \text{ (initial cost)} + \$3 \text{ (annual cost)} = \$93 \text{ per year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to determine when the annual revenue exceeds the annual cost. We set up the inequality:
\[ \$10.5 \text{ (annual revenue)} \geq \$93 \text{ (annual cost)} \]

Since the annual revenue is less than the annual cost, Carlos will never start earning money from the lemon tree based on the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is that it will never happen.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\text{never}} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after all this. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we'll add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Then, we'll multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
\[
2x = 36
\]

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's check the answer to make sure it's correct.

1. She started with 18 vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since we end up with 5 vacuum cleaners, our solution is correct. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, the number of students in hip-hop dance is 12. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Current value of jewelry: $5,000
- Market growth rate for jewelry: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Current value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Market growth rate for electronic gadgets: 1.2%

Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we compare the future values to determine which purchase will yield more profit:
- Future value of jewelry: $5,125
- Future value of electronic gadgets: $8,096

The electronic gadgets will have a higher future value, so the merchant should choose to buy the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

To find the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} - \text{Current Value of Electronic Gadgets} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 8096 - 8000 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 96 \]

So, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."
"To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered in both directions.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Now, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
\[ \$35,000/\text{year} + \$22,500/\text{year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \$57,500 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day:**
   Claire uses 3 eggs each morning.

2. **Calculate how many eggs she uses in one week:**
   There are 7 days in a week. So, if she uses 3 eggs each day, in one week she will use:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:**
   If she uses 21 eggs in one week, then in 4 weeks she will use:
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance and how fast she needs to walk that distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, she has already spent 1 + 1 = 2 hours walking the first 6 miles.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. So, the remaining distance is:
12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find out how much time she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles, we use the formula for average speed:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

We know the average speed she wants is 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles. Let \( t \) be the total time she needs to walk the entire 12 miles to achieve this average speed:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{t} \]
\[ t = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks:
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

We spill one liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total volume:
\[ \text{Remaining volume} = 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find out how much of this remaining 9 liters is water. Since the original orange drink was two-thirds water, the remaining orange drink is:
\[ \text{Remaining water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
\[ \text{Total remaining water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \). So, we have:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

Now, let's add up these costs:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of servings Cynthia needs for 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - There are 60 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of servings needed is:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons are needed, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - Cynthia needs 4 cartons.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of his second stop from the distance of his first stop.

First, we know the total distance of the trip is 60 miles.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles, 15 miles before the end would be 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his second stop from the distance of his first stop:

20 miles (first stop) - 45 miles (second stop) = -25 miles

However, since we are looking for the distance traveled, we should consider the absolute value of the difference, which is 25 miles.

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, the second pair of heels costs:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of both pairs of high heels together:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \( B \), we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age, and then calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. **Understand the ratio and total age:**
   - The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
   - The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

2. **Set up the variables:**
   - Let Darrell's age be \(7x\).
   - Let Allen's age be \(11x\).

3. **Formulate the equation for the total age:**
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]

4. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]

6. **Find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:**
   - Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
   - Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

7. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:**
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed and then find the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 (first friend) + 60 (second friend) + 100 (third friend) = 240

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of friends, which is 3:
240 ÷ 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
2. John takes care of 10 dogs.
3. So, to find out how many hours a day John spends on all the dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of one dog:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]
4. Now, to find out how many hours a week John spends on all the dogs, we multiply the number of hours he spends each day by the number of days in a week (7 days):
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35 hours a week."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Gretchen has \( S \) silver coins.
2. According to the problem, she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, the number of gold coins \( G \) can be expressed as \( G = S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins is 110. So, we can write the equation: \( S + G = 110 \).
4. Substitute \( G \) from the second equation into the third equation: \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).
5. Simplify the equation: \( 2S + 30 = 110 \).
6. Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2S = 80 \).
7. Divide both sides by 2: \( S = 40 \).
8. Now, we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40. To find the number of gold coins \( G \), we use \( G = S + 30 \): \( G = 40 + 30 = 70 \).

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels.

Half of Raymond's jewels is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 25 jewels.

So, Siobhan has:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's find out how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. We know he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, 25% more points than 4 points is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points from the first 20 minutes to the points from the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one yogurt costs. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in one day, he spends $1.25 * 2 = $2.50 on yogurt.

Over 30 days, he will spend $2.50 * 30 = $75.00 on yogurt.

So, the final numerical answer is $75.00."
"First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. So, we can find out how much money he had initially by adding the money he spent on video games and the money he has left.

\[ \$195 \text{ (money from lego sets)} - \$160 \text{ (money spent on video games)} + \$5 \text{ (money left)} = \$40 \]

So, John initially had $40. Now, we need to find out how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he has 0 lego sets left.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in those 3 hours and then find his speed.

First, let's find out how long he runs each day:
- The first day he runs for 3 hours.
- The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs for \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours each of those days.

Now, let's calculate the total running time in hours:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So,
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find out how fast Dana can run. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Ben's iPhone is. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. Let's write the final answer:

"First, let's find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

So, we calculate:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

So, we calculate:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving.

So, the total calories in the 300g bag is:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.

So, the remaining calories you can consume for the day is:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g, we can find out how many grams you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

Next, we calculate the cost of the beeswax and the wicks. Since 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, 2 pounds of beeswax will cost $20.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, then 20 candles will bring in $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The total cost is $20.00 (cost of beeswax and wicks), and the total revenue is $40.00.

So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:**
   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, we calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday as follows:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, we calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday as follows:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"First, let's determine how many post-it notes Candice used at work. She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 post-it notes at work.

Next, we need to find out how many post-it notes she had before she bought the new package. She started with 80 post-it notes and had 23 left after using some. So, the number of post-it notes she used is:
\[ 80 - 23 = 57 \]

Since she used 57 post-it notes before buying the new package, and she used 220 post-it notes at work, the total number of post-it notes she had before buying the new package is:
\[ 57 + 220 = 277 \]

This means she had 277 post-it notes before she bought the new package. Since she ended up with 23 post-it notes after using some, the number of post-it notes she purchased is:
\[ 277 - 23 = 254 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{254} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties.

To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of one blue tie:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one red tie. We know that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. The cost of one blue tie is $40, so the cost of one red tie is:
\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of one red tie} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, to find the total amount John spent on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$800 \]"

So, 4 feet of wire is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a day. We know they produce 252 eggs per day.

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs this is. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, we know that Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes per day, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \]

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes.

He removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.

So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday separately, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60. So, the revenue from truck tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repaired 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40. So, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repaired 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40. So, the revenue from car tires on Friday is:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic did not repair any truck tires on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires on Friday is:
  \[
  0 \times 60 = 0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue on Friday is:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out which day had the higher revenue and by how much:
- The revenue on Thursday is $520.
- The revenue on Friday is $480.
- The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
  \[
  520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}

"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:

28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

So, Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for one trip to the movies and then see how many times he can afford that total cost with his $42.

The cost for one trip to the movies is:
- Ticket: $7
- Popcorn: $7

Total cost for one trip = $7 + $7 = $14

Now, we need to find out how many times $14 fits into $42.

To do this, we divide the total money Peter has by the cost of one trip:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. We know the following:

1. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
3. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

First, let's determine the maximum weight the truck can carry after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck. We subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

This means the truck can carry an additional 1245 pounds after accounting for the driver and the empty truck. Now, we need to find out how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, we can add 83 boxes to the truck without exceeding the weight limit. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:

\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"First, let's find out how much the delivery vendor added to the bill. They charged a 25% fee on the original total of $40.00.

To calculate 25% of $40.00:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

So, the delivery vendor added $10.00 to the original bill.

Now, let's add the delivery fees and the tip to the original bill:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 + \$3.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the extra fees is:
\[ \$57.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$57.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries/cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters:

\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2
- Good oranges: rest of the oranges

Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges:

20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges are good:

Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

The final numerical answer is:
17"
"First, let's find out the total cost of the brooch before insurance. Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

This means the total cost of the brooch before insurance is $1300.

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of this total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 1300 = \frac{10}{100} \times 1300 = 0.1 \times 1300 = 130 \]

So, Janet pays $130 for insurance.

Now, to find the total amount Janet paid, we add the cost of the brooch (before insurance) and the insurance cost:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Pension**: Marcy gets a pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
   - So, for the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

2. **After 20 Years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of her pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of $50,000 per year.
   - 5% of $50,000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \).
   - So, starting from the 21st year, her annual pension becomes $2,500.

3. **Pension for the Next 10 Years**: Marcy works for a total of 30 years, so she gets the 5% pension for the next 10 years (from the 21st to the 30th year).
   - For the next 10 years, her annual pension is $2,500.

Now, let's calculate the total annual pension she gets over the 30 years.

- For the first 20 years, her pension is $50,000 per year.
- For the next 10 years, her pension is $2,500 per year.

The total pension over 30 years is:
\[ 20 \times 50,000 + 10 \times 2,500 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \]
\[ 10 \times 2,500 = 25,000 \]
\[ 1,000,000 + 25,000 = 1,025,000 \]

So, her annual pension after 30 years is $1,025,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1025000} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the monthly cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year (first half of the year).
   - So, the total cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840
     \]

2. **Calculate the monthly cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The streaming company charges 10% less on the second half of the year.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     140 \times 0.10 = 14
     \]
   - Subtract this amount from the original monthly cost:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - So, the monthly cost for the second half of the year is $126.

3. **Determine the total cost for the second half of the year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the total cost for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596
     \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. So, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total miles traveled}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now that we know her car can drive 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons of gas:

\[ \text{Miles per full tank} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Gallons in a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does it.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV. So, the time he spends reading is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, each time he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He does this 3 times a week. So, the total time he spends on TV and reading each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = \text{Number of diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. Since there are 140 rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate how much she received from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the $40 she received from her allowance. Let's denote the amount of money she started with as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply that by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each day.
- There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).

So, the total number of classes on weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

Now, let's add the number of classes from weekdays and Saturday to get the total number of classes in one week:
\[ 25 \text{ classes (weekdays)} + 8 \text{ classes (Saturday)} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students Judy teaches in one week is:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in one week is:

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars/brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ cheesecakes} \times 4 \text{ dollars/cheesecake} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount Tommy raises:
\[ 129 \text{ dollars} + 92 \text{ dollars} = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest. Each cell phone costs $150, so:

\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2%, so we calculate 2% of $750:

\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, we add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average square footage of each level of Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

We know that the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16. Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

So, let's find the square footage of each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: half of Level 4 = 16 / 2 = 8 square feet
- Level 2: half of Level 3 = 8 / 2 = 4 square feet
- Level 1: half of Level 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 square feet

Now we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day.
   - So, for 180 days, the puppy will need \(180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

2. **After 180 days:**
   - The puppy will need 2 cups of dog food every day.
   - We need to find out how many days are left in a year after the first 180 days.
   - A year has 365 days, so after 180 days, there are \(365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days}\).
   - For these 185 days, the puppy will need \(185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}\).

3. **Total dog food needed in the first year:**
   - The total amount of dog food needed is the sum of the dog food needed for the first 180 days and the next 185 days.
   - So, the total is \(180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag.
   - So, \(550 \text{ cups} \div 110 \text{ cups/bag} = 5 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

We need to find out how much laundry David does and then find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount David does.

Let's start by finding out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

To find David's laundry, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know David does 100 pounds of laundry. Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first figure out the cost of buying 18 flowers at each price option.

### Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- So, 6 packages of 3 flowers are needed.
- The total cost for 6 packages is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

### Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- So, 9 packages of 2 flowers are needed.
- The total cost for 9 packages is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two options to see which one is cheaper:
- Option 1 costs $15.
- Option 2 costs $9.

Vincent saves \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price (Option 2).

"First, let's find out how much the discount is. The original cost of grooming is $100, and John gets a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply $100 by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form):

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost to find out how much John has to pay:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the final cost of grooming is $70."
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Water per girl} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water the boy got to the total water the girls got:

\[ \text{Total water} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Total water} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The original amount of water was 24 liters. So, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Water left} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Now, we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Therefore, their combined weights are 623 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is L.
2. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is L + 8.
3. The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22.
4. So, we can write the equation: L + (L + 8) = 22
5. Simplifying the equation: 2L + 8 = 22
6. Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14
7. Divide both sides by 2: L = 7
8. Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won: L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the number of games they won is 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."

3. **Determine the number of rows in the quilt:**
   - Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations.
   - Since he has 11 years of vacations, he will have 11 rows.

4. **Calculate the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - Each row has 11 quilt blocks (one from each year).
   - There are 11 rows.
   - Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is \(11 \times 11 = 121\).

So, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 121."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add up all the times the alarm rang:
- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\).

The final numerical answer is 22."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% every year for employees who have been with the company for five years. Since Sylvie just completed 5 years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **First Year of Increase**: After the first year, her salary will increase by 10%.
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} + 0.10 \times \text{Initial Salary} = 600 + 0.10 \times 600 = 600 + 60 = 660
   \]

4. **Second Year of Increase**: After the second year, her salary will increase by another 10%.
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \text{Salary after first year} + 0.10 \times \text{Salary after first year} = 660 + 0.10 \times 660 = 660 + 66 = 726
   \]

5. **Third Year of Increase**: After the third year, her salary will increase by another 10%.
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \text{Salary after second year} + 0.10 \times \text{Salary after second year} = 726 + 0.10 \times 726 = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6
   \]

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{798.6}
\]"
"Let's call the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \).

According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. So we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Now let's calculate the value of \( H \).
```python
# Calculation
H = 88000 / 11
H
```
```output
Done
```
The calculation gives us:

\[ H = 8000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8000}

"First, let's find out how many guests will actually attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, 1/4 of 16 is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. So, the number of guests who will attend is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest. So, for 12 guests, the total number of gift bags needed is:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2. So, the total cost for 9 gift bags is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"First, let's find out how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad and there are 20 adults, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's find out how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children:

\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 225 \]"
"First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:

\[ \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

\[ \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together. We add the number of pets each of them has:

\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"First, let's find out how fast Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee runs it in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast he can now run, we need to calculate 10% of his old time and then subtract it from his old time.

10% of 40 seconds is:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's new time after the improvement is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the number of dogs is 60.
2. We are told that there are two cats for every dog. So, if there are 60 dogs, then the number of cats is \(60 \times 2 = 120\).
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first need to find the combined number of dogs and cats. That is \(60 + 120 = 180\).
4. The number of rabbits is 12 less than 180, so the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).
5. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together. That is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The final numerical answer is:
348"
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

There are 200 students in total. 2/5 of them are boys, so the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 hours by 2/3.

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's understand the problem step by step.

1. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
2. When she cooks the canned tomatoes, they lose half their volume. This means that the 32 ounces of sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes she used before cooking.
3. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.
4. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
5. To find out how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes she used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can: \(64 \div 16 = 4\) cans.
6. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars left on the motorway is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
3. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam. Let's call the number of cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes \(x\).
4. After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
5. After these cars have driven through, the number of cars left on the motorway is \(25 - x - 20 = 5 - x\).

Since the number of cars left on the motorway after the traffic jam is 5, we can set up the equation:
\[5 - x = 5\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[5 - x = 5\]
\[x = 0\]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(x = 0\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 2 \text{ plants/ledge} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary receives 18 new potted plants from her nursery. So, we add these to the number of plants she already has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, we calculate the total number of plants she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 1 \text{ plant/ledge} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times

- 8 pages from Geography

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading after reading 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages he still needs to read is:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

He has 4 days left to read these 24 pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages/day

So, the final numerical answer is 6 pages per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Weekdays**: John drinks water with his meals every day from Monday to Friday.
   - He drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
   - He drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
   - He drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
   - So, for each day, he drinks 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 glasses of water.
   - Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 glasses/day * 5 days = 15 glasses of water.

2. **Weekends**: On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks a soda with dinner instead of water.
   - He drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
   - He drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
   - He drinks 0 glasses of water with dinner (he drinks a soda instead).
   - So, for each day, he drinks 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 glasses of water.
   - Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 glasses/day * 2 days = 4 glasses of water.

Now, let's add the glasses of water he drinks during the weekdays and the weekends:
- Glasses of water during weekdays: 15 glasses
- Glasses of water during weekends: 4 glasses
- Total glasses of water in a week: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

First, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

We can set up a proportion to solve this:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Here, \(x\) is the time in minutes it takes to cover 42 miles. To find \(x\), we can cross-multiply and solve for \(x\):

\[
3x = 42 \times 10
\]

\[
3x = 420
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{420}{3}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000 pieces.

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: 
   - Poppy places a quarter of the pieces.
   - A quarter of 1000 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{1000}{4} = 250
     \]
   - So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**:
   - After placing 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
     \[
     1000 - 250 = 750
     \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**:
   - Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the TV watching time for each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 30 minutes for a 30-minute show, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes, so \(2\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry meant to bake \( x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked twice as many as he meant to, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so \( 2x = x + 15 \).
4. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 15 \). So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies.
5. But he actually baked \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies.
6. He then drops 5 cookies, so he has \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cookies left.
7. Now, he has a total of 110 cookies.

It seems there is a discrepancy because we calculated 25 cookies left, not 110. Let's recheck the problem statement and our steps. The problem states he has 110 cookies now, so we need to find out how many he meant to bake initially.

Since he ended up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, he must have had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies before dropping them. This means he actually baked \( 115 \) cookies.

Since he meant to bake twice as many as he actually baked, he meant to bake \( \frac{115}{2} = 57.5 \) cookies. But since the number of cookies must be a whole number, and the problem setup suggests he meant to bake a whole number, we need to recheck the initial conditions. The correct interpretation is that he meant to bake 57 cookies (since 58 would be more than 115 if he meant to bake twice that).

So, Henry meant to bake 57 cookies last year. Let's confirm:

- He meant to bake 57 cookies.
- He actually baked \( 2 \times 57 = 114 \) cookies.
- He dropped 5 cookies, so he has \( 114 - 5 = 109 \) cookies.
- He ends up with 110 cookies, which matches the problem statement.

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry meant to bake last year is 57.

The final numerical answer is:
57"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

Cost per gallon = $3.00
Number of gallons = 10

Total cost without cashback = Cost per gallon × Number of gallons
Total cost without cashback = $3.00 × 10 = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons:

Cashback per gallon = $0.20
Number of gallons = 10

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon × Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 × 10 = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost without cashback to find the final cost after cashback:

Final cost after cashback = Total cost without cashback - Total cashback
Final cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's fruit roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups both of them ate:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = Beatrice's + Marcell's = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average number of fruit roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's find out how many seconds it takes Julia to row one foot. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, we can calculate the time it takes to row one foot:

\[ \text{Time per foot} = \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Julia can row in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Feet rowed in 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{0.8 \text{ seconds per foot}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. So, we can calculate how much water the boat took on in 80 feet:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

Now, let's add the total cost of both types of lumber:
- Total cost = cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- So, the total revenue from these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- So, the total revenue from these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

Now, let's add the total revenue from both types of lumber:
- Total revenue = revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = total revenue - total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's denote the number of parts of sugar as 7x and the number of parts of water as 13x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of parts (teaspoons of sugar + cups of water) is given as 120. So we can write the equation:
\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar. Since the number of parts of sugar is 7x, we substitute x = 6 into the expression for the parts of sugar:
\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many vehicles were initially at the port. Since there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, the initial number of vehicles is:
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
   \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
   - Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as \( L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - We know that \( 1.3L = 40000 \).
   - To find \( L \), we solve the equation:
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Therefore, his new salary is:
     \[
     40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
     \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Therefore, her new salary is:
     \[
     30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
     \[
     56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
     \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since each pad has 30 sheets, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's determine how many fruits Kael brought.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette: \(5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits}\)
- Kael: \(10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits}\)

Next, we add the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 2 hours less than Wednesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than Friday, so she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept from Monday to Sunday:

\[
8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 4 \text{ (Thursday)} + 4 \text{ (Friday)} + 5 \text{ (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ (Sunday)}

"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The total time she runs is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate how far she can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts of her run:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. So, she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

This means that the 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters include the 20 letters that Jennie stamped plus some letters that were already stamped before Jennie started. 

So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

The final answer is 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Julia originally had \( x \) plastic spoons.
2. She bought a new package of spoons, which we'll call \( y \).
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
5. After all this, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's write an equation based on the information given:

- Before using any spoons, Julia had \( x \) spoons.
- After buying the new package, she had \( x + y \) spoons.
- After her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had \( x + y + 5 \) spoons.
- After using 3 spoons, she had \( x + y + 5 - 3 \) spoons.
- We know that after all this, she had 12 spoons, so we can write the equation:
  \[
  x + y + 5 - 3 = 12
  \]

Simplify the equation:
\[
x + y + 2 = 12
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[
x + y = 10
\]

We know that \( x \) (the original number of spoons) plus \( y \) (the number of spoons in the package Julia bought) equals 10. Since we are asked to find the number of spoons in the package Julia bought (\( y \)), we need to find \( y \).

From the equation \( x + y = 10 \), we can see that \( y \) must be a number that, when added to \( x \), equals 10. Since \( x \) is the original number of spoons and we don't have a specific value for \( x \), we can infer that \( y \) must be a whole number that fits the equation.

Given that \( x + y = 10 \), and knowing that \( x \) is a positive integer, \( y \) must also be a positive integer. The simplest and most logical value for \( y \) that fits this equation is 5, because if \( y = 5 \), then \( x = 5 \).

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, to find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"First, we need to find out how many friends Amy has. We know that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends. So, we add 20 to 50 to find out how many friends Amy has:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Now we know Amy has 70 friends. To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:

\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \]

So, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120."
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. We know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, the cost of an orange is:
\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for each type of fruit Dillon is buying:
- The cost for 4 watermelons is:
\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost for 20 peppers is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost for 10 oranges is:
\[ 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum up the costs of all the fruits to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[ \boxed{880} \]"
"To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue from the patients and subtract the total cost of the doctors' services.

First, let's find out how many hours of doctor time are used per day. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. With 500 patients a day, the total doctor time used is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost of the doctors' services. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so for 200 hours, the cost is 200 * $150 = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, so for 200 hours, the revenue is 200 * $200 = $40,000.

Finally, the profit is the revenue minus the cost: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"First, let's find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we calculate:

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. Now, we subtract these 20 elves from the total number of elves to find out how many are left:

\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the 40 elves that are left:

\[
40 - 10 = 30
\]

So, the number of elves left is 30. Let's write the final answer:

\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. So, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

So, the final numerical answer is 20%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 700 bees in total.
2. Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).
3. The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, so it is \( 2Q \).
4. The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so it is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

Now, we can write the total number of bees as the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens. Now we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- Number of baby bees = \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- Number of worker bees = \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \)

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."

"First, let's identify the items that are nonfood items and calculate the tax on them. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps.

- Light bulbs cost 3 dollars each.
- Roach traps cost 4 dollars each.

Now, let's calculate the tax for each of these items. The tax rate is 10%.

- Tax on light bulbs: \( 3 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 0.3 \text{ dollars} \)
- Tax on roach traps: \( 4 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 0.4 \text{ dollars} \)

Next, we add the tax to the original cost of each nonfood item.

- Total cost for light bulbs: \( 3 \text{ dollars} + 0.3 \text{ dollars} = 3.3 \text{ dollars} \)
- Total cost for roach traps: \( 4 \text{ dollars} + 0.4 \text{ dollars} = 4.4 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items, including the food items (milk, eggs, and cups) which do not have tax.

- Cost of milk: 2 dollars
- Cost of eggs: 3 dollars
- Cost of cups: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items: \( 2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 8 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, add the total cost of nonfood items to the total cost of food items.

- Total cost of nonfood items: \( 3.3 \text{ dollars} + 4.4 \text{ dollars} = 7.7 \text{ dollars} \)

- Total cost including tax: \( 8 \text{ dollars} + 7.7 \text{ dollars} = 15.7 \text{ dollars} \)

So, the final total cost is 15.7 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the supplies for each client. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
The cost of 1 pack of cloths is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total cost for supplies for each client is:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ 92 - 72 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Lucas will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's find out how many pineapples John can harvest from one hectare in a year.

John can harvest every 3 months, so in a year (which has 12 months), he can harvest:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ times} \]

Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, in one hectare, he can harvest:
\[ 100 \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples} \]

Now, John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, so in total, he can harvest:
\[ 400 \times 10 = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4000."
"First, let's find out how many pieces are in the second lego set. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which has 500 pieces. So, the second set has:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's find out how many pieces are in the third lego set. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which has 500 pieces. So, the third set has:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's add up all the pieces from the three sets to find out how many pieces Johnny has to pick up:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[ 2125 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2125 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   She sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. So, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours. So, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   Every bee that left before had not already returned. From the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and from the next 6 hours, 60 bees left. So, the total number of bees that left is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Since all these bees had not returned by the end of the first 12 hours, they all return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of an adult ticket and a child ticket together and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has first, and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Since Dorothy has 4 friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to convert the distance Steve lives from the school into feet because his speed is given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to get home is:

\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the distance Tim lives from the school into feet:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to get home is:

\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Tim takes longer to get home, he is the loser. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for all the people who came to get their bikes inflated.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles.
- The total cost for inflating the tires of 5 bicycles is \(5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles.
- The total cost for inflating the tires of 3 tricycles is \(3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle.
- The total cost for inflating the tire of 1 unicycle is \(1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 1 \times 1 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost for bicycles: 250 cents
- Total cost for tricycles: 225 cents
- Total cost for the unicycle: 25 cents
- Total cost: \(250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\).

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
- \(500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total amount Shawnda made that day is 5 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside.

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we need to find out the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10.

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill.

\[
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, Dave had \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) fries left.
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
5. After the pigeons, Dave had \( 7 - 9 = -2 \) fries left. This means Dave had 2 fries left before the pigeons ate, but since he only had 7 fries after the seagull, this step shows the sequence of events.

Now, let's calculate the remaining fries after the pigeons:
- Dave had 7 fries left after the seagull.
- The pigeons ate 9 fries, so Dave had \( 7 - 9 = -2 \) fries left, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the sequence. Let's correct it by considering the pigeons ate 9 fries from the 7 fries Dave had left, so Dave had \( 7 - 9 = -2 \) which is not possible, so we need to recheck the sequence.

Let's recheck the sequence:
- Dave had 7 fries left after the seagull.
- The pigeons ate 9 fries, but since Dave only had 7 fries, the pigeons ate 7 fries, leaving Dave with \( 7 - 7 = 0 \) fries.

Now, the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries:
- The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3} \times 0 = 0 \) fries, so the remaining fries are still 0.

Finally, an ant carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind, which means the ant carried off 0 fries, and the remaining 5 fries are the original amount minus all the fries eaten and stolen.

So, the original number of fries in the pack is:
\[ 14 + 7 + 9 + 0 + 5 = 35 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up for the entire semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- So, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), the total hours spent in class on these days in one week is:
\[3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- So, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), the total hours spent in class on these days in one week is:
\[2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, let's find the total hours Kimo spends in class in one week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours Kimo spends in class in one semester is:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[272\]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls = 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

2. **Chocolate croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- Total length = 1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we use the fact that 1 foot = 12 inches:
- Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in 2 months.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by each type of ape in 2 months:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month. So in 2 months, they need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month. So in 2 months, they need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month. So in 2 months, they need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in 2 months:

\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, for each round trip, he runs 100 yards forward and 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards per round trip. Since he does this 15 times, the total distance he runs is:

\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards per round trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she runs is:

\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract the total distance Kelly runs from the total distance Blake runs:

\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The rim of bond paper cost $20. So, the cost for the bond paper is:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Raphael spent:

"Finn originally saw 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 of them came out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increased to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 of them hid under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreased to 17 - 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   - So, the depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.

2. **Determine the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - So, the depth on Wednesday = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24\) feet.

Now, let's calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24\):

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
\]

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin. So, Locsin caught:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]

Next, let's find out how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin. So, Locsin caught:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]

Now, let's find out how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin. So, Locsin caught:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

Now we can calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin. Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Locsin caught:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

So, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after each two-month period, the price is multiplied by \(1 + 0.20 = 1.20\).

Let's denote the original price of the bag of marbles as \(P_0 = 20\) dollars. After the first two months, the price \(P_1\) will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times 1.20 = 20 \times 1.20 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

After the second two months, the price \(P_2\) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.20 = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see that the price after each two-month period is multiplied by 1.20. So, after 18 periods, the price \(P_{18}\) will be:
\[ P_{18} = P_0 \times (1.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \((1.20)^{18}\). We can do this step by step or use a calculator:
\[ (1.20)^2 = 1.44 \]
\[ (1.20)^4 = (1.44)^2 = 2.0736 \]
\[ (1.20)^8 = (2.0736)^2 = 4.299816 \]
\[ (1.20)^{16} = (4.299816)^2 = 18.539155776 \]
\[ (1.20)^{18} = (18.539155776) \times 1.20 = 22.2469869312 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 22.2469869312 = 444.939738624 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{444.94} \]"
"First, let's find out how much one red car costs. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures would cost:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we need to find out how much one action figure costs. The problem states that an action figure costs $5.

We also know the number of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of 1 doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Finally, we add up the costs of all the toys to find the total value:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, let's understand the problem. Jackie can do freelance work and earn $35 per hour. If she does her own taxes, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. This means she will lose $35/hour * 3 hours = $105 in missed income.

Now, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will not lose any income from freelance work, but she will have to pay $90 to the accountant.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income from doing her own taxes to the cost of hiring an accountant.

Missed income from doing her own taxes = $105
Cost of hiring an accountant = $90

So, the difference (or how much more money she will have) if she hires the accountant is $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $15."
"First, let's add up the cost of all the items Elvira bought:

- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:

1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

1500 - 1423 = 77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to figure out how many eggs she needs for 15 flans and then see how many times she needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

Each flan needs 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age can be denoted as \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( B \):

\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 28 - 4 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking schedule for the weekdays and the weekend.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Now, we add the miles he walks on weekdays and the weekend together:
\[100 + 20 = 120\]

So, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"First, let's find out how much the jacket costs. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Since the hat costs $25, the jacket costs:

Now, we add the total legs from each group:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds. We add the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo:

\[
19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's find out the total minimum monthly payments for all of Jessica's debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find out how much 50% more is, we calculate:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, 50% more than the minimum is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (months in a year):

$1500/month * 12 months/year = $18000/year

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato.

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time for each task by 60.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds

Now, let's calculate these values.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) seconds

Since 60 seconds is equal to 1 minute, we can convert 300 seconds to minutes:

- \( 300 \) seconds \( = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and cut the potatoes:

- Total time: \( 90 \) minutes (peeling) \( + 5 \) minutes (cutting) \( = 95 \) minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each gallon of lemonade. The cost for lemons is $3 and the cost for sugar is $2. So, the total cost for each gallon is:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much they make from selling 20 glasses of lemonade. Since each glass is sold for $0.50, the total revenue from 20 glasses is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. They made a profit of $25, so we can set up the following equation to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10 - \text{Total Cost} = 25 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 - 25 = -15 \text{ dollars} \]

This negative value indicates an error in our interpretation. The correct approach is to find the total cost based on the profit and revenue. Since the profit is $25, the total cost must be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 - 25 = -15 \text{ dollars} \]
This means the total cost is $15. Since the total cost is $15 and the cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 3 gallons of lemonade. Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

1. Rent: He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Car fuel: He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Remaining amount after donation:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is 350 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. We know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs.

So, Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Next, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:

Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

Now, we can find the total number of crabs the three have together:

Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to calculate how many votes the winner got.

The winner got 3/4 of the votes. If the total number of votes is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying 80 by 3/4:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \]

So, the winner got 60 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner got:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of white carnations Sandra ordered is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is \( 4x \).
3. The number of pink calla lilies Sandra ordered is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. So, we can write the equation: \( 5x = 200 \).

First, we need to find the value of \( x \) (the number of white carnations):
\[ 5x = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Now that we know \( x = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.

Let's calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
- Jan's current age is 30.
- Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
- Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

Now, we know that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than this value:
- Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Since two years ago Mark was 19 years old, we can find out how old Mark is now:
- Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team.

Each member of the faster team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the faster team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team.

The first runner takes 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner takes:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]

The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner takes:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]

The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner takes:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add up the times for all four members of the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the faster team and the slower team:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how many apples Jenna and her mom picked together, we can start by figuring out how many apples Jenna picked. We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples.

So, Jenna picked:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number her mom picked:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of apples they both picked is:
\[ 30 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Hamsters' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - So, the total number of hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\).
   - Since all the hamsters are in separate cages, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 150 pieces.

2. **Rabbits' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
   - This means the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20 pieces.

3. **Total Straw Distributed to Small Rodents:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed to the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - We know that 150 pieces of straw are given to the hamsters and 20 pieces are given to the rabbits.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(160 - 150 - 20 = 10\) pieces.

4. **Rats' Straw Distribution:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Let's say there are \(r\) rats in each cage.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).
   - We know that the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 10 pieces.
   - Therefore, \(18r = 10\).

5. **Solving for \(r\):**
   - To find \(r\), we divide both sides of the equation \(18r = 10\) by 18.
   - \(r = \frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9}\).

Since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, and \(\frac{5}{9}\) is not a whole number, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need to recheck the problem statement. However, based on the given information and the logical steps, the number of rats in each cage is \(\frac{5}{9}\), which is not a whole number. 

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the final answer is:

\(\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}\)"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months with a 2% monthly interest rate.

First, let's find the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 2\% \text{ of } \$100 = \frac{2}{100} \times 100 = \$2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for the second month is calculated on the new principal, which is the original amount plus the interest from the first month:
\[ \text{New principal after 1 month} = \$100 + \$2 = \$102 \]
\[ \text{Interest for the second month} = 2\% \text{ of } \$102 = \frac{2}{100} \times 102 = \$2.04 \]

Now, we add this interest to the new principal to get the total amount after the second month:
\[ \text{Total after 2 months} = \$102 + \$2.04 = \$104.04 \]

Next, we calculate the interest for the third month on this new principal:
\[ \text{Interest for the third month} = 2\% \text{ of } \$104.04 = \frac{2}{100} \times 104.04 = \$2.0808 \]

Finally, we add this interest to the total amount after the second month to get the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months:
\[ \text{Total after 3 months} = \$104.04 + \$2.0808 = \$106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \$106.12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$106.12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The trader buys some bags of wheat at $20 per bag.
   - Let's say the trader bought \( x \) bags of wheat.
   - The total cost of buying the wheat is \( 20x \) dollars.

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - It costs $2 to transport each bag.
   - So, the total cost of transporting \( x \) bags is \( 2x \) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for buying and transporting the wheat is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The trader sells each bag at $30.
   - If he sold \( x \) bags, the total revenue is \( 30x \) dollars.

5. **Profit calculation:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - So, \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 8x = 400 \).
   - Divide both sides by 8: \( x = 50 \).

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost for rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost of the rides to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect in 3 hours.

First, we need to know how many minutes are in 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so in 3 hours, there are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. So, in 180 minutes, he will collect:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much each duck needs to eat per week. We know that the total amount of insects needed by the flock of ten ducks is 3.5 pounds per week. So, we divide this by the number of ducks to find out how much one duck eats in a week:
   \[
   \text{Insects per duck per week} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ ducks}} = 0.35 \text{ pounds per duck per week}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much each duck eats per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
   \[
   \text{Insects per duck per day} = \frac{0.35 \text{ pounds per week}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.05 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

3. Finally, to find out how much the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day, we multiply the daily amount for one duck by the number of ducks:
   \[
   \text{Total insects per day for the flock} = 0.05 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"First, let's calculate how many trees Tom adds and subtracts each year.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net increase in trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase of 8 trees per year.

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, we need to find 30% of 130 trees and subtract that from the total number of trees.

30% of 130 trees is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees left after 30% die is:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[ 91 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After taking back and painting 6 flamingos, the number of pink flamingos left on Sue's front yard:**
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

4. **On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - So, the total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)

5. **The number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - The number of white flamingos is the same as the number of flamingos taken back and painted, which is 6.

6. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

7. **To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

24"

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money Violetta has:

So, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's find out how much a pen costs. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, the cost of a pen is:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. Since each pen costs $1.50, the cost for 8 pens is:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots distributed will be:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds."

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7500 \text{ cents} \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains.

First, let's find out how many pails of water Baldur gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is \(5 + 6 = 11\) pails.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, to find out the total number of liters of water he gets in a day, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains:
- Total liters of water = \(11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

The final numerical answer is:
55"
"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise.

John's original salary is $2000 per week. A 5% raise means he gets an additional 5% of $2000.

To find 5% of $2000, we calculate:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 2000 = 0.05 \times 2000 = 100 \]

So, his new salary after the raise is:
\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much he makes in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply his new weekly salary by 52:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

John also received a one-time monetary reward of $5000. To find the total amount of money he made that year, we add the one-time reward to the total amount he made from his new salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"First, let's find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, we need to break down the problem into parts and then add them together.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Big dish of macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 10 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Big dish: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese = 10 + 9 + 8 = 27 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue pens and red pens we bought, we get:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the sum of the scores of the first five tests.
2. Then, we will use the average formula to find out what the total sum of all six test scores should be to get an average of 93.
3. Finally, we will subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum to find out what the sixth test score should be.

Let's start with step 1:

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.

Sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Now, let's move to step 2:

To get an average of 93 over six tests, the total sum of all six test scores should be:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score needed on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ 558 - 438 = 120 \]

So, Brinley needs a score of 120 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

### First Four Weeks
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.

So, the total kilometers he rode in one week during the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} = 125 \text{ km/week} \]

For four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is:
\[ 125 \text{ km/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

### Next Three Weeks
- Micheal decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.

So, the total kilometers he rode in one week during the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} = 120 \text{ km/week} \]

For three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is:
\[ 120 \text{ km/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

### Total Kilometers
Now, we add the kilometers from both parts:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, let's find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Now, we know there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each chocolate bar:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by the weight of each candied apple:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]

Let's box the final answer:

"First, let's find out how many cakes Rose bought on Tuesday. She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Since she bought 4 cakes on Monday, we can calculate the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 3 \times \text{Cakes on Monday} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's find out how many cakes she bought on Wednesday. She bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Since she bought 12 cakes on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday as follows:

\[ \text{Cakes on Wednesday} = 5 \times \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes she bought on each day:

\[ \text{Total cakes} = \text{Cakes on Monday} + \text{Cakes on Tuesday} + \text{Cakes on Wednesday} = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 76 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - There are 20 dozen cups, so the cost of one dozen cups is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{20} = 1740
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - There are 12 cups in one dozen.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is:
     \[
     \frac{1740}{12} = 145
     \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes together:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after considering her savings.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the additional money she needs to earn is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens.
2. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens.
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens produce \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.
5. The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens, which is 42 eggs. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   \]
6. Now, let's solve the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r = 42 - 10
   \]
   \[
   8r = 32
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{32}{8}
   \]
   \[
   r = 4
   \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks around the park. Since the park is a rectangle, the distance around it (the perimeter) can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. We know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. So, to find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first and second days from the total number of customers:
   \[
   500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250
   \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

The final numerical answer is:
250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the small pool has \( x \) gallons of water now.
2. Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, it had \( 2x \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago.
3. The big pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So, in 4 minutes, it would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.
4. Therefore, the big pool now has \( 2x - 16 \) gallons of water.
5. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, \( 2x - 16 = 4x \).

Now, let's solve the equation \( 2x - 16 = 4x \):

\[
2x - 16 = 4x
\]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

\[
-16 = 2x
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = -8
\]

Since \( x \) represents the amount of water in gallons, and gallons cannot be negative, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's recheck the setup and the equation. The equation \( 2x - 16 = 4x \) should be correct, but the negative value suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the value of \( x \) that fits the context, we can conclude:

The small pool has \( x = 8 \) gallons of water now.

So, the final numerical answer is:

8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 2040 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid:
\[ 2040 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount promised:
\[ 2200 - 2040 = 160 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's find out how many dahlias there are. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."

2. **Determine Adrian's age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Zack's age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age}
   \]
   Solving for Zack's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[

- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards left is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100.

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions and upgrades:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to pay part of the bill:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, the final amount Chad still owes is $9.00."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces.

To find the number of minutes, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together in one minute:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the number of minutes by 60:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. We know that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. This means the number of watermelons left after the first harvest is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, Ashlyn came back two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. Let's calculate how many of these were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the second two weeks. This means the number of watermelons left after the second harvest is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 21 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration.

Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Mark also needs to pay $1000 for registration on each car.

\[ \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert.

So, Kylie collected \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Since she collected 25 shells on Monday, on Tuesday she collected \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. We know that one-third of the 36 penguins do this. So we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, we find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Again, one-third of the 36 penguins do this. So we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left. We start with 36 penguins and subtract the number that went to the ocean and the number that went to the cave:

\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's find out how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can divide Steve's daily intake by 2 to find out how much his girlfriend eats.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Since Steve's girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, in a week she eats:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

So, the total number of tomatoes they eat together in a week is:
\[ 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Now, we know that one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they need by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce:
\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for him and his girlfriend. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. John has 20 friends and he wants each friend to have 4 slices. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend wants:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas John needs to order. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much money Johnny had after adding the extra $10 to his $20 allowance.

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, Johnny had $30 after adding the extra $10.

Next, we know that this sum of $30 tripled in a year. To find out how much money he had after a year, we need to multiply $30 by 3.

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:

\[ \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we can find Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age:

\[ \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, we have the ages of all three girls:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is 25 years old.
- Mary is 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add their ages together:

\[ \text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Let's add these numbers:

\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

This means 420 students went out through exit B. The rest of the students went out through exit C. So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

Given that John has 54 candies:

\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now we know Robert has 27 candies. Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]

Substituting the number of candies Robert has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now we know James has 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate how many books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.
So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate how many books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.
So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, let's add up all the books they read:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.
So, together they read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each person sends \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pages a week.

Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all 3 people is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) pages a week.

Mike responds in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week.

Now, we need to calculate how long it takes Mike to write 30 pages. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so for 30 pages, it will take \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, \(180 \div 60 = 3\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used this month.

He has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes he uses for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

So, the total number of minutes Jason has used this month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes Jason has left from his 1000-minute plan:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ 250 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - First aquarium: 4 snails
   - Second aquarium: 32 snails

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( x \). According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.**
   - Since there are two aquariums, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2x \).
   - Therefore, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   28 = 4x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{4} = 7
   \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She needs the makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time. So, for one week, she works:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/time} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she works for the entire movie is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30000:
\[ 10\% \times 30000 = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean pays:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 27000 \]"
"First, let's find out the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We add up all the individual expenses:

- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies.

Isabelle is splitting this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost is being divided among three people (Isabelle and her two parents).

To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person pays $32.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the chef spent on these onions. We know that a pound of onions costs $1.50. So, we multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent $300.

"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies}\]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies}\]

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Sue's total calories:
\[46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\]

Her sister's total calories:
\[18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\]

Finally, we find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
\[9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many students are in the school in total.

Each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, so:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ students} \]

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.50 \times 60 = 30 \text{ boys} \]
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.50 \times 60 = 30 \text{ girls} \]

So, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know from the problem that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( x \) cougars today. Then he killed \( 3x \) wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so:
\[ x = 15 - 3 = 12 \]
So, today Rick killed 12 cougars and \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed today:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

To find the total number of animals killed over the two days, we add the number of animals killed last night and today:

"First, let's find out how many 10-foot sections the redwood tree has. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10:

\[ \frac{200}{10} = 20 \]

So, the redwood tree has 20 sections of 10 feet each.

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the entire redwood tree before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. To find out how much wood the termites ate, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find out how much the redwood tree weighs after the termites ate 30% of it, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if Jamal has \( J \) apples, then:
   \[
   52 = J + 8
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 52 - 8 = 44
   \]
   So, Jamal has 44 apples.

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, if Jamal has \( B \) bananas, then:
   \[
   B = J + 4
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 44 \):
   \[
   B = 44 + 4 = 48
   \]
   So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

4. Now, we need to find out how many fruits Andrea and Jamal have in total. Andrea has 52 apples and 48 bananas (since she has half as many bananas as Jamal):
   \[
   \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 52 + 48 = 100

"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, let's find the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, let's calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds by subtracting the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total fees} - \text{Loan amount} \]
\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

   - So, the cooking time is \( 28 - 5 = 23 \) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - This is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \( 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \) minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 50 \text{ ads} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 15 \text{ ads} = 1125 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. So, the second bag has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. So, the third bag has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Bedrooms in Each House:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - So, the total number of bedrooms in both houses is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) bedrooms.

2. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows in all bedrooms is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) windows.

3. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

4. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.
   - So, the total number of windows is \(12 + 8 = 20\) windows.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first figure out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes:
   \[
   \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes:
   \[
   2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
   \]

3. Now we know the total stitches for the collar and the rosette:
   \[
   90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches}
   \]

4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the stitches used for the sleeves are:
   \[
   1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches}
   \]

5. Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches}
   \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

765"

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - So, Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene = 2 * 54 = 108 lines.
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   - Number of Sean's lines in the first scene = 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the second scene = 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   - Number of Sean's lines in the second scene = 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines Sean has to memorize = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

So, the final numerical answer is 138."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging both small and large holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes:
Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
1 hour = 60 minutes.

So, 240 minutes = 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

The final numerical answer is:
4 hours"
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

1. We know that the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20.
2. This means if we add their ages together, we get 20.
3. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
4. So, if we add 10 years to each of their current ages, their total age will increase by 20 years (10 years for Mico + 10 years for Marco).

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \).

From the first equation, we have \( R = 6S \). Substituting this into the second equation gives:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, we multiply the number of popsicles by the price per popsicle:

\[ 20 \text{ popsicles} \times \$0.25 \text{ per popsicle} = \$5.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the price per ice cream bar:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream bars} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ice cream bar} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, we can find the number of spots a mamba has by dividing the number of spots a cobra has by 2:

\[ \text{Spots of a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. We know there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots of all cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

We also know there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots of all mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots of all the cobras and all the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Now, let's add up all the people:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Each pizza serves 3 people.

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the pizzas. Each pizza costs $15.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the silver beads. Finally, we divide that length by the length of each silver bead to find the number of beads.

1. Calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. Calculate the remaining length for the silver beads:
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Length left for silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. Calculate the number of silver beads:
   - Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
   - Number of silver beads = Length left for silver beads / Length of each silver bead = 17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 = 68 beads.

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of stories each wrote in the first week.
2. Calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks.

First, let's list the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up the totals for all three:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we can calculate the total value of the quarters as follows:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, we can calculate the total value of the dimes as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents. We subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- There are three rows of 8 stars each.
- There are two rows of 6 stars each.
- The rest of the stars are in rows of 5 stars.

First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of stars in these rows:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, the number of stars that are in rows of 5 stars is:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we can find the number of rows of 5 stars by dividing the number of 5-star rows by 5:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour and it needs to cover the same 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} \]

Substituting the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes she works as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the half-hour break she takes. This means she works for:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns for 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

4. **Check if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

5. **Calculate the total points after the extra point is distributed:**
   - Mike's points remain 21.
   - Jim's points remain 18.
   - Tony's points increase by 1 to 43.

1. **Pushups on the second day:**
   - On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups.
   - On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of pushups on the second day is:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120
     \]

2. **Squats on the second day:**
   - On the first day, Darren does 50 squats.
   - On the second day, he does 10 fewer squats than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of squats on the second day is:
     \[

   - Total dumbbell presses:
     \[
     20 + 40 = 60
     \]

Finally, we add up the totals for all exercises to get the final count.

\[
220 \text{ (pushups)} + 90 \text{ (squats)} + 60 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 370
\]

So, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much rice is consumed in a week and then determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's find out how much rice is consumed by one person in a week:
- Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
- There are 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner).
- So, one person eats \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
- In a week (7 days), one person eats \(0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2.8 \, \text{kg/week}\).

Now, let's find out how much rice is consumed by 5 people in a week:
- If one person eats 2.8 kg of rice in a week, then 5 people will eat \(2.8 \, \text{kg/week} \times 5 = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

Finally, we need to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 5 people:
- If 5 people consume 14 kg of rice in a week, then a 42 kg bag of rice will last \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

So, the final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates

Next, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
45 crates + 20 crates = 65 crates

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
55"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bidding Increase**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. **Number of Bidders**: There are 4 people bidding, including Carmen. Carmen bids after each of the other 3 people.

Let's calculate the bids:

- **First Bid**: Carmen's first bid is $200.
- **Second Bid**: The next person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
- **Third Bid**: Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
- **Fourth Bid**: The next person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
- **Fifth Bid**: Carmen's third bid is $350 + $50 = $400.
- **Final Bid**: The next person bids $400 + $50 = $450.

Carmen wins the auction with her final bid of $450.

So, the final amount of money Carmen pays for the desk is $450.

"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. So, the total distance he drives each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

He goes to work 5 days a week, so the total distance he drives in a week is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

There are 50 weeks in a year, so the total distance he drives in a year is:
\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. The cost is $2 per mile, so:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver per year. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's think about how a 32-page tabloid is made from a single piece of paper. When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you create two equal halves. Then, you can print the pages on these halves.

Here's how the pages are typically arranged:
- Page 1 is on the left back.
- Page 2 is on the left front.
- Page 32 is on the right back.
- Page 31 is on the right front.

This means that each half of the paper is used to print 16 pages. Since the paper is folded in half, you need two halves to print all 32 pages.

So, the number of pieces of paper used is 2.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's find out how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Now, let's add the $10 she spent on rides:

\[
25 + 10 = 35
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:

\[
50 - 35 = 15
\]

So, the amount left with Annika is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means that the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\) books.
4. Elise sold 45 books this year.
5. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year. So, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold in the first and second years is \(90 + 45 = 135\) books.
7. The total number of books sold in the three years is 200, so the number of books sold in the third year is \(200 - 135 = 65\) books.

Now, we need to find out how much money Elise earned in the second year. Each book sells for $20.

So, the money earned in the second year is \(45 \times 20 = 900\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
900"
"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate how many hours Watson works in a week:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.

So, the total hours he works in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage:
- Watson earns $10 per hour.
- He works 50 hours a week.

So, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 500 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month of April, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. April has 4 weeks.

So, the total bonus for the month of April is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add his weekly earnings from his hourly wage to the total bonus for the month:
\[ 500 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 2000 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"First, let's find out how many people John beat. If he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, we calculate 80% of 20 people.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat.

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy loses per week} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much you save on one tub of ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. So, the discount on one tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

This means you save $2 on one tub of ice cream. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on the ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how much you save on one packet of milk. The packet of milk was originally sold at a price that we don't know, but we know it was sold at a discount of $0.5. So, the discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on the milk would be:

\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \]

Now, to find the total savings if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we add the savings from the ice cream and the savings from the milk:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount you will save is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Extra Arm Growth:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - We do this by dividing 15 by 3: 
     \[
     15 \div 3 = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Leg Growth:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - We do this by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     15 \div 5 = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

So, after 15 days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- Total cost for business suits = 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- Total cost for suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- Cost of one business suit = $100.
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
- Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for business suits = $600.
- Total cost for suitcases = $150.
- Total cost for the flight ticket = $1200.
- Total cost for all items = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the amount he can spend is:
- Amount he can spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount he can spend to find out how much he can spend on gifts:
- Amount he can spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

So, the final numerical answer is $2050."

1. **Determine the number of people eating 3 eggs each day:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3.

2. **Determine the number of people eating 2 eggs each day:**
   - The rest of the family (5 - 3 = 2 people) eat 2 eggs each day.
   - So, the number of people eating 2 eggs each day is 2.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 3 people eating 3 eggs each day in a day:**
   - Each of the 3 people eats 3 eggs.
   - So, the total number of eggs for these 3 people in a day is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 2 people eating 2 eggs each day in a day:**
   - Each of the 2 people eats 2 eggs.
   - So, the total number of eggs for these 2 people in a day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day:**
   - The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

6. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"First, let's find out how old Jane is. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn and Quinn is 30 years old, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jane's age} = 27 \]

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 years to Jane's age:

\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Trent's age} = 32 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago in terms of Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - So, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).
   - Simplifying, \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve this equation, we first need to combine the terms on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2. So we rewrite the equation as:
\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Adding these together, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He added the 20 marbles he bought to the 50 marbles already in the store, and then added the 8 marbles his father gave him. So, the total number of marbles is \(20 + 50 + 8 = 78\).
5. Each marble weighs 2 kgs. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is \(78 \times 2 = 156\) kgs.

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs.

"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know there are 30 boys in the classroom.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. So, if there are 30 boys, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
3. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys. So, the number of nongendered children is \(1/10 \times 30 = 3\).

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the given ratio and use it to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is given as 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as \( P \) and the number of electric wires as \( W \).

According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of people at the party at the beginning.

There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is:
\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left, and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. So, the number of women who left is:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The problem states that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). So, the total number of pencils Jam has can be expressed as:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 24 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes, which means she has:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ pencils} \]

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we need to add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
\[ 24 + 46 = 70 \text{ pencils} \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 70 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider two main factors that weaken the coffee: the cooling by ice cubes and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how much the coffee is weakened by the cooling by ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes used is:

\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to consider the weakening due to the addition of cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

So, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve this, we need to understand that for every 2 old records traded, Ralph gives out 1 new record. 

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, it means they traded enough old records to get 7 new ones. 

Since 1 new record is given for every 2 old records traded, we can set up a simple ratio to find out how many old records were traded in total.

The ratio is:
\[ \text{1 new record} : 2 \text{ old records} \]

So, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers and senior programmers there are.

We know that the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees. So, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

We also know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the payment to each senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We are told that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation: \( x + 6 = 20 \).

Now, let's solve the equation to find \( x \):

\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school. So, he has \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends. So, he has \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops.
5. After buying, he has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night. So, he has \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning. So, he has \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops left.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's understand the problem. The phone is already at 60% charged and needs to be fully charged, which means it needs to reach 100% charge. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes.

To find out how many percentage points the phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, we do:
100% - 60% = 40%

Now, since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, to charge 40 percentage points, we need:
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and her mother gives her 10 more, so she has:

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase.
   - So, for $80, they get $8 off (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After using the rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - The rewards used were $8, so the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - The final price after applying the coupon is $35 - $16 = $19.

So, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate on the net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job. The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."
"First, let's find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins.

To find 40 percent of 220, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Number of ruins} = \frac{40}{100} \times 220 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of ruins} = 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

To find half of 88, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Number of unmanned castles} = \frac{1}{2} \times 88 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of unmanned castles} = \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for the installments is:
\[ 6 \times 350 = 2,100 \]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is:
\[ 1,350 + 2,100 = 3,450 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

The total cost for the installments is:
\[ 9 \times 250 = 2,250 \]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is:
\[ 1,100 + 2,250 = 3,350 \]

Now, we find the cost difference between the two offers:
\[ 3,450 - 3,350 = 100 \]

The cost difference between the two offers is:

- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Now, let's add these numbers together to find the total number of guns:

8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

So, each of them would have 6 guns if they shared them equally."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- So, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, let's calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- So, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
So, the initial value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase:
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4 \]
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at the new price of $12 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 25\% \text{ of } \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3 \]
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at the new price of $9 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the total number of students is 200.
2. The class is split into 3 groups: two groups are equal in number, and the third group is 10 students less than each of the other two groups.
3. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \).
4. The number of students in the smallest group will then be \( x - 10 \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of students:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. This can be written as:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]

   Also, the total number of animals is 60:
   \[
   H + C = 60
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the total number of animals equation:
   \[
   2C + C = 60
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   Solve for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   Using \( H = 2C \):
   \[
   H = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**
   - Each cow has 4 legs.
   - Each chicken has 2 legs.
   - Total legs from cows:
     \[
     20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} = 80 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - Total legs from chickens:
     \[
     40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} = 80 \text{ legs}

"Let's break down the information given in the question step by step:

1. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. The animals are: pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird. The container weighs 20 pounds.

"First, let's find out how many meters Tyson would run if he follows his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. 

1/5 times more means he will run 1 + 1/5 = 6/5 times the distance he currently runs.

Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. So, if he runs 6/5 times 5000 meters, we calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{New distance} = 5000 \times \frac{6}{5} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{New distance} = 5000 \times 1.2 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, Tyson runs 6000 meters every day. June has 30 days. So, to find the total distance he covered in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 6000 \times 30 \]

"First, let's calculate how much money the factory made per day when they made tractors.

They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor.
So, the daily income from selling tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money they make per day now that they make silos.

They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo.
So, the daily income from selling silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making per day now, we need to calculate the difference in their daily income and then find out what percentage this difference is of their previous daily income.

The difference in daily income is:
\[ \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Income} - \text{Old Income}}{\text{Old Income}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first and then multiply it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

1. **Food cost per month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, the food cost per month is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats cost per month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - So, the treats cost per month is $20.

3. **Medicine cost per month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - So, the medicine cost per month is $100.

Now, we add up the monthly costs:
- Total monthly cost = Food cost + Treats cost + Medicine cost
- Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $120

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the monthly cost by 12:
- Annual cost = Total monthly cost \(\times\) 12
- Annual cost = $120 \(\times\) 12 = $1440

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."

"First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Number of plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we know that April needs a total of 30 plant pots for the daisies and 60 plant pots for the roses. So, the total number of plant pots needed is:

\[ \text{Total plant pots needed} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots before she knew how many she needed. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Number of plant pots bought} - \text{Total plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount of money she spent or gave away is $11 (sweater) + $4 (to her brother) = $15.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount she spent or gave away from the amount she started with:

$36 (initial amount) - $15 (spent/given away) = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is 21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long. So, the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We are told that this 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent. Let's denote the total time he spent as \( T \). So, we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that 40% of the total time \( T \) was spent sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she earns from both jobs to find the total amount she has earned:

\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars} \]

Annabelle already had $80 in her savings. So, let's add that to the money she earned from her jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs $45 to save for the phone."
"First, let's find the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet tall. So, the height of the second tree is:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. So, the height of the tallest tree is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars and each toy car costs $2.

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears and each teddy bear costs $1.

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent.

\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10.

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts.

- The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
- The cost for two rides on the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the $90 budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself.

- Money left after mini-golf and go-karts = $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this amount from the remaining money.

- Money left after arcade tokens = $65 - $5 = $60.

This $60 is the total amount of money available for Morgan and her friends. Since each person (including Morgan) gets $5 in arcade tokens, we can find out how many people can share this $60.

- Number of people = $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 11 friends (since she is also one of the people).

The final numerical answer is 11."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day.

Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost for lollipops each day is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets as pocket money each day. She gets $5 every day.

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves each day. This is the difference between the pocket money she gets and the cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Marisa saves $4 each day.

Finally, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. We multiply the daily savings by 5:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He has $10 and after buying candy, he spends half of his change on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy spent $2 on gumballs. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left after buying candy. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had after buying candy was $8, which means he spent $8 on candy.

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought approximately 5.33 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5.33 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's say the age of Carver's son is \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{50}{2} = x \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip and then find out how many miles it travels in 3 trips. After that, we can determine how many days it goes between services based on the train's mileage service requirement.

First, let's find the distance the train travels from the third city to the first city. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is:

\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's calculate the total distance for one complete trip (from the first city to the third city and back to the first city):

\[ 75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} + 50 \text{ miles} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:

\[ 225 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 675 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:

\[ \frac{675 \text{ miles/day}}{18,000 \text{ miles/service}} = \frac{675}{18000} = \frac{1}{26.67} \approx 0.0375 \text{ days} \]

Since the train goes through 3 trips in one day, we need to find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles. We can do this by dividing 18,000 miles by the distance traveled in one day:

\[ \frac{18000 \text{ miles}}{675 \text{ miles/day}} = 26.67 \text{ days} \]

So, the train goes between services every 27 days (since we round up to the nearest whole day).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the stuffing needed for a collie bed:**
   - A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
   - To find the average, we add the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed and then divide by 2.
   - So, the average is \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds.
   - Therefore, the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - Mark needs to make 3 collie beds.
   - Therefore, the total stuffing needed for the collie beds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds.

4. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for all the beds:**
   - The total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is 8 pounds.
   - The total stuffing needed for the collie beds is 15 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total stuffing needed is \(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds.

So, the total pounds of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 23 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
23"
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance for the trip to his friend's house including the detour is:

\[ \text{Total distance to friend} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time taken to drive this distance at 70 mph is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken to drive back home is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house, the time for the detour, and the time back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total time} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is approximately 8.857 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. We know that 5 girls were absent on Friday. Since there are 53 boys in total, the number of boys who were absent is 4. Therefore, the number of boys who were present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is 49.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 49 \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then the number of boys is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 boys in the park. To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we need to add the points she has already scored on her first and second tests and then subtract that total from the minimum total points required for passing.

Jane's scores on the first and second tests are 15 points and 18 points respectively. So, the total points from the first two tests is:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

The total points required for passing are at least 42 points. To find out how many more points Jane needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

So, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Customers Refused to Wear Masks:**
   - Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks = 3

2. **Shoplifting:**
   - Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 4 * (number of customers) - 5
   - Substituting the number of customers: 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

3. **Physical Violence:**
   - Number of people kicked out for physical violence = 3 * (number of shoplifters)
   - Substituting the number of shoplifters: 3 * 7 = 21

Now, let's add up the number of people kicked out for each reason:
- Customers for masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence: 21

Total for these three reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

We know the total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
- 50 - 31 = 19

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's find out how many points Erin has now. We know that Sara scored 8 points and Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

So, Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points after scoring these points. This means that before scoring these 14 points, Erin had:

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - Points scored
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors, so the cost for the picture frames is:
\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to add the additional 20% cost for etching the logo on each picture frame. The additional cost per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total cost for etching the logo on all 44 frames is:
\[ 44 \times 4 = 176 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the picture frames and the etching cost:
\[ 880 + 176 = 1056 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. There are 44 seniors and 1/4 of them are officers, so the number of officers is:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]
Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1208 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
\[ \boxed{1208} \]"
"First, let's find out how much the DIY materials cost. The market price is $400, and a DIY saves 20% on this cost. 

To find 20% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, the DIY materials cost $80 less than the market price. 

Now, we subtract this savings from the market price to find the DIY cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 320 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Double of 14 pairs is \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of shoes sold on Saturday.
   - Half of 28 pairs is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.

4. **Returns:**
   - Six pairs of shoes were returned because they didn't fit.
   - So, we need to subtract 6 pairs from the total sold on Sunday.

5. **Total Sales Calculation:**
   - Total shoes sold on Friday: 14 pairs
   - Total shoes sold on Saturday: 28 pairs
   - Total shoes sold on Sunday before returns: 14 pairs
   - Total shoes sold on Sunday after returns: \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs

6. **Summing Up Total Sales:**
   - Total shoes sold = Friday + Saturday + Sunday
   - Total shoes sold = 14 + 28 + 8 = 48 pairs

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 48 pairs."
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours she practiced on each day.

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
On Saturdays, she had twice as long as Tuesday's practice, which means she had \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours of practice.

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. We know that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. The total number of pieces is the total amount of money spent divided by the cost per piece. However, since we don't know the cost per piece, we can directly use the percentage to find the number of faulty pieces.

The total number of pieces of equipment is $400,000 worth, and 40% of these pieces are faulty. So, the number of faulty pieces is:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 400000 = 0.40 \times 400000 = 160000 \]

This means there are 160000 faulty pieces. Since the total number of pieces is $400,000 worth, and 160000 pieces are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is:
\[ 400000 - 160000 = 240000 \]

The total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is the same as the total amount of money the company spent on the equipment, which is $400,000.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 400000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many sheep give 1 kg of milk and how many give 2 kg of milk.

Mary has 30 sheep in total. Half of them give 1 kg of milk, and the other half give 2 kg of milk.

So, half of 30 sheep is:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each day, so the total milk from these sheep is:
\[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ kg} \]

The other 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each day, so the total milk from these sheep is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's add the milk from both groups of sheep to find the total milk collected every day:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine how many bread rolls Mrs. Sherman made. She made a dozen bread rolls, and a dozen means 12.

After feeding her 6 children with one roll each, the number of rolls left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Next, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find out how many pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, 20 pupils like blue.

Next, we need to find out how many pupils are left after those who like blue are accounted for. We subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

Now, we know that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, 5 pupils like green.

To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[
40 - 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, let's break down the information given:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked and got $56. Since each apple is sold at $4, we can find out how many apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total money she got by the price per apple:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. So, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the number of apples picked each day:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples on Monday} + \text{Number of apples on Tuesday} + \text{Number of apples on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"First, let's understand what Lindsay has washed and how many socks that is.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks. So, the number of socks she washed from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

So, the number of socks Lindsay missed is:

First, let's calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{10}{100} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 365 \]

So, the total amount Karan will have to pay back is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 365 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 4015 \]

Karan has to pay this total amount back over five months, so we divide the total amount by 5 to find out how much she has to pay each month:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{4015}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 803 \]

So, Karan has to pay $803 per month."
"First, let's calculate how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So for Cho:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \, \text{km} \]"
"First, let's find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Millie makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we know that Millie's total cost to make the lemonade is $18. To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade in an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left.
2. We are told that he has 12.8 hectares left, which represents 2/5 of his total land.
3. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1/5 of his land is, and then multiply that by 5.

Let's calculate:

- If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 of his land would be 12.8 hectares divided by 2.
- So, 1/5 of his land = 12.8 hectares ÷ 2 = 6.4 hectares.
- Now, to find out the total land he had at first, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5.

Let's do the multiplication:

- Total land = 6.4 hectares × 5 = 32 hectares.

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of boys and girls as follows:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

So, there are 26 boys and 26 girls in the choir.

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. This means that only half of the female members can perform. So, the number of female members who can perform is:

Number of female members who can perform = 26 / 2 = 13

Then, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the number of female members who can perform plus the 3 teachers:

Total number of people who sang = 13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we need to divide this total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.

So, the cost of the erasers is:
\[ 6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 \text{ per eraser} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.

So, the cost of the pencils is:
\[ 8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 \text{ per pencil} = \$24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
\[ \$12 + \$24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is:
\[ \$36 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many messages Mr. Yu receives. We know that Mr. Yu receives 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson. Ms. Thompson receives 66 messages, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David spends $30 on the ride bracelet.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. So, Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha spends 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36 on tickets.

Now, let's compare the total costs for David and Dasha. David spends $30, and Dasha spends $36. The difference in their costs is $36 - $30 = $6. This means David saves $6 by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

So, the total number of gifts is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and she wants to use it for 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, and then find the difference between the number of popsicles Sam has and the number of popsicles Betty has.

First, let's understand the ratio given: 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

We know the total number of popsicles is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:

\[
\text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:

- Betty's popsicles: \(5 \text{ parts} \times 15 \text{ popsicles per part} = 75\)
- Sam's popsicles: \(6 \text{ parts} \times 15 \text{ popsicles per part} = 90\)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[
\text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15
\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services Tim will get:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. So, the discount for each is $10 * 20% = $2.
- Therefore, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 - $2 = $8 each after the discount.

Now, let's add up the costs of Hulu, Disney Plus, and Netflix:
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8
- Netflix: $10

Total cost for streaming services = $8 + $8 + $10 = $26

Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now, he is paying $26 a month for streaming services.

To find out how much money he saves, we subtract the total streaming cost from the cable cost:
- Savings = $60 - $26 = $34

So, the final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's find out how much time Carol spent recording the song. She spent half the time recording that she spent writing, so:

Time spent recording = 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours

Next, we need to convert all the time spent into the same unit. Let's use minutes for this calculation.

1 hour = 60 minutes

So, the time spent writing in minutes is:
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The time spent recording in minutes is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

The time spent editing is already in minutes:
90 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total time = 450 minutes

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many spots are available in the shelving system.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. So, the total number of spots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these spots. Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, she wants to place \( 2x + 20 \) books.

Since the total number of spots is 36, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 20 = 36 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 20 = 36 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 16 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Wendy wants to place 8 books in each spot. Now, we calculate the total number of books she needs to carry:
\[ 2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards from her dad is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Now, let's add the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought:

\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we need to account for the cards she passed out and the cards she received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She gave 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she had:

\[ 50 - 24 - 5 + 17 \]

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Subtract the cards passed out:
\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]

2. Subtract the cards given to her family:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]

3. Add the cards she received:

"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. We know she saw 90 spiders and that the number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs Nancy saw. We know the number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

Now, we add up all the bugs Nancy saw:

\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

So, the total number of calories John consumed is 48 calories."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- The builder works 4 weeks every month.
- The builder works 6 days every week.
- The builder gets paid $50 every day.

To find out how much the builder earns in a month, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a month and then multiply that by his daily pay.

Number of days the builder works in a month:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Now, we calculate his monthly earnings:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$1200/\text{month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

"First, let's determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, we multiply the amounts by 4:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To find out how many bags Mark needs:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To find out how many bottles Mark needs:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. We know it uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

Next, let's find out how much energy it uses in one day before the reduction. Since it uses 900 watts per hour and it runs for 8 hours a day, the energy used in one day is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watts/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

So, the energy used in one day after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watts/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in one day, we subtract the new daily usage from the original daily usage:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts/day} - 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 4500 \text{ watts/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts/day} \]

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily savings to kilowatts:
\[ 135000 \text{ watts/day} = 135 \text{ kilowatts/day} \]

Finally, to find out how much energy is saved in 30 days in kilowatts, we multiply the daily savings in kilowatts by 30:
\[ 135 \text{ kilowatts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 4050 \text{ kilowatts} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4050 \text{ kilowatts} \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

Jane has:
- 2 zebras with 17 stripes each.
- 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
- 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stripes:

- For the 2 zebras with 17 stripes each: \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) stripes.
- For the zebra with 36 stripes: \( 36 \) stripes.
- For the zebra with 18 stripes: \( 18 \) stripes.

Adding these together:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

So, the total number of stripes is 88.

To find the average number of stripes, we need to divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. Jane counted 4 zebras.

\[ \text{Average number of stripes} = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese are required for 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:

- Meat needed: \(5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}\)
- Cheese needed: \(5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}\)

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:

- Cost of meat: \(5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00\)
- Cost of cheese: \(5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00\)

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

So, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}

"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has initially is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis he has is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

So, the new number of corns he has is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first figure out how many steps he took in total and then subtract the steps he took before and after his jog.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he took 5,000 steps there and back. Then he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Let's add up the steps he took before his jog:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000
- Steps with his friend: 1,000
- Steps left after his jog: 2,000

Now, we can calculate the total steps he took before and after his jog:
\[ 5,000 + 1,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 \]

Since his goal was to take 10,000 steps, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 \]

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. He reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, which will take 30 minutes. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. So, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May:
- Carolyn hired 40 employees.
- Each employee works 40 hours a week.
- Each employee is paid $15 per hour.

The weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600/\text{week} \]

The total pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{week} = \$24,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid in June:
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired.
- The number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

The remaining employees in June are:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The total pay for the remaining 30 employees in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{week} = \$18,000 \]

The total pay for all employees in June is:
\[ 10 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{week} = \$6,000 \]

Now, we sum the total pay for May and June:
\[ \$24,000 + \$18,000 + \$6,000 = \$48,000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{48000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for 2 pounds, the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $6.00
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $11.50 = -$1.50

Since Sally does not have enough money to cover the total cost, she is short by $1.50. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

-1.50"
"First, let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400. The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

Now, let's add the cost of the two packs together: $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200: $1200 * 20% = $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a finale firework that costs $150. So, we add the cost of the finale firework to the discounted cost of the fireworks: $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. For 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are both dangerous and defective. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and that 5% of the dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

So, 2500 candles are dangerous. Now, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the dangerous candles have this defect:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

So, 125 of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 125 \]"
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price for each blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree:**
   - From the tallest trees: Joanne gathered 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: Joanne gathered half the amount from the tallest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \( x \).

2. **Determine the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from each type of tree:**
   - From the tallest trees: Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: Joanne's sister gathered three times as many apples as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: Joanne's sister gathered 0 apples.

3. **Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 500 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump. So, the total number of humps can be written as:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To find out the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = 4 days * 200 km/day = 800 km.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 7 days * 300 km/day = 2100 km.

Now, we add up all the distances from each segment to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip.

- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the next day + Distance for the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, if we let the size of Zack's locker be \( Z \) cubic inches, then:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}Z = 5
   \]
3. To find \( Z \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   Z = 5 \times 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.
4. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If we let the size of Timothy's locker be \( T \) cubic inches, then:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}T = 20
   \]
5. To find \( T \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   T = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]
   So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is:

"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge that is 4,000 feet below. So, the comb landed at an elevation of:

\[ 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver was at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of the comb:

\[ 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb."
"First, let's find out how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. So, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, let's add the money he received from both banks to his initial capital. He initially had $5000. So, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken away is:

\[ 4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats per boat} = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the original number of cats:

\[ 50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of the 30 cats:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

\[ 30 \text{ cats} - 18 \text{ cats} = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the cost into parts:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month.
   - So, the cost for the first 6 months is \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

2. For the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), the cost is $12 per month.
   - So, the cost for these 2 months is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

3. For the next 12 months (months 9 to 20), the cost is $14 per month.
   - So, the cost for these 12 months is \(12 \times 14 = 168\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Cost for the first 6 months: $48
- Cost for the next 2 months: $24
- Cost for the next 12 months: $168

Total cost for 2 years is \(48 + 24 + 168 = 240\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Next, let's find out the total cost of both jeans before the sale. The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, let's find out how much he saved from each. The total savings is $6, and 1/3 of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, which is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

This $4 is the amount he saved from the tattered jeans. Now, let's find out the original cost of the tattered jeans. We know the tattered jeans cost $28, and he saved $4 from them. If he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, it means he paid $28 - $4 = $24 for the tattered jeans. But we already know the tattered jeans cost $28, so the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The jogger jeans cost $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28, so the difference is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total capacity of the buses:

- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.

So, the total capacity of the buses is:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees/bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:

- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.

So, the total capacity of the minibusses is:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, let's calculate the total capacity of the minivans:

- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.

So, the total capacity of the minivans is:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[ 240 \text{ employees (buses)} + 180 \text{ employees (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ employees (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. So, she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each day.
The bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

For the 3 store-bought bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
For the 3 bird feeders Lillian made, the total number of birds attracted is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final numerical answer is 150."
"First, let's find out the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how much money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny gets $50 in spending cash after selling his cards.
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - Since Kenny only has $50, he needs to borrow the remaining $50 to buy the ticket.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling his cards:**
   - Since he needs $100 to buy the ticket and he has $50, he made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards.

3. **Determine how many cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he made by the price per card: $50 / $1.5 = 33.33.
   - Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, he sold 33 cards.

4. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards.
   - This means he sold 2/3 of his cards.
   - If 2/3 of his cards is 33, then 1/3 of his cards is 33 / 2 = 16.5.
   - Since he can't have half a card, we need to check if 33 cards is correct. If 33 cards is 2/3, then 1/3 would be 33 / 2 = 16.5, which is not possible with whole cards. So, let's recheck the division: 33 cards is indeed 2/3, so 1/3 would be 33 / 2 = 16.5, but since we can't have half a card, we need to consider the closest whole number. The correct number of cards Kenny started with is 33 because 33 cards sold means 16.5 cards kept, which is not possible with whole cards. So, we need to consider the closest whole number, which is 33.

Therefore, Kenny started with 33 cards.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. We know that half of the guests would eat two hotdogs each. There were 40 guests, so half of them is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20

Each of these 20 guests would eat 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared is:

\[
20 \times 2 = 40

Next, we need to see how many guests wanted a second hotdog. Since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs per guest} = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer only prepared 40 hotdogs. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 \text{ guests} - 40 \text{ hotdogs} = 0 \text{ guests}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 is:
0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is $132.00."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, we add these amounts together:

The total cost of the items is $19.

Next, let's find out how much money Dora has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. So, we add these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much gas is in each container. We know that 15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers. So, we divide 15 gallons by 5 containers:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, we need to find out how much 1/4 of a container is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply the number of gallons Josey needs by 8:

"First, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. He got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, 120 cents is equal to:

\[ 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left after buying the chips. This means that the 1% of his money left is equal to the amount he spent on chips, which is $1.20. So, we can calculate the total amount of money George had initially as follows:

\[ 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 1\% \text{ of total money} \]

Therefore, the total money George had initially is:

\[ 1.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know that George spent $1.20 on chips and had $1.20 left. So, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:

\[ 120 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 118.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is equal to $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{118.80 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 158.4 \]

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, George bought 158 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{158} \]"

"First, we need to find out how much cake Rory and her mom have eaten together. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have:

1 piece + 1 piece = 2 pieces

The cake was originally cut into 8 pieces, so the remaining pieces are:

8 pieces - 2 pieces = 6 pieces

The original cake weighed 20 ounces, and since each piece is equal, each piece weighs:

20 ounces ÷ 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Now, to find out how much the remaining 6 pieces weigh, we multiply the weight of one piece by 6:

2.5 ounces/piece × 6 pieces = 15 ounces

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's find out how many oranges they have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges equally among these 8 people. So, we divide 56 oranges by 8 people:

\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes to drive from Wayne's hotel to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to drive from Bernadette's apartment to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Time from Bernadette's apartment to the theater} = 4 \times \text{Time from Wayne's hotel to the theater} \]
\[ \text{Time from Bernadette's apartment to the theater} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time from Bernadette's apartment to the theater} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave:

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave} = \text{Time from Bernadette's apartment to the theater} - 5 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we know the length of the room is 9 feet and the area is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
So, we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads:

- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

So, Elizabeth bought a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's calculate how many beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads:

- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

So, Margareth bought a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

80"
"First, let's calculate how much the temperature of the house increases when Marcus is baking for 3 hours. The temperature rises by 5 degrees every hour.

So, for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking for 3 hours, the temperature will be:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the temperature will cool down by:
\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature of the house after the window is opened for 30 minutes will be:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"First, let's convert all the times Jon took to complete the triathlon into minutes for easier calculation.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, we calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:
\[ 10\% \text{ of 40 minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

James's swim time:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes. So, James's total time is:
\[ 170 - 10 = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long James took for the run. We know his times for the swim and bike:
\[ 36 \text{ minutes (swim)} + 85 \text{ minutes (bike)} = 121 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James took for the run. Then:
\[ 121 + R = 160 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 160 - 121 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1.25 hours by 60:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, in 30 minutes (which is half an hour) the horse will run:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Michael's horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael will have is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total.

She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs would be:

"First, let's find out the cost price of each sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the rest of the sneakers sold to the department store are:

\[ \text{Remaining sneakers} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from 31 sneakers} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling all the sneakers:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost price from the total revenue. The total cost price is:

\[ \text{Total cost price} = 48 \times \$12 = \$576 \]

So, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the costs for both options:

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

We know that you saved $2 by choosing the regular ticket option. So, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much it cost to fill one balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we can divide $900 by 20 to find the cost per balloon.

\[
\text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 per balloon.

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To calculate \(170 \times 65\), we can break it down:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

First, calculate \(170 \times 60\):

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]

Next, calculate \(170 \times 5\):

\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Now, add these two results together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:

1. For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, let's add the distances to get the total distance:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after trading 3 sapphires for two rubies. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies Jenna received. Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the 2 rubies she received are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels (5 sapphires and 2 rubies) is:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that Marin eats 4 apples a day.
2. Nancy also eats 4 apples a day.
3. So, together they eat \(4 + 4 = 8\) apples a day.
4. Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. Since they eat 8 apples a day, in 30 days they will eat \(8 \times 30 = 240\) apples.

So, the final numerical answer is 240."
"First, we need to find out the total volume of the raised beds. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume of one raised bed, we multiply these dimensions together:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one raised bed by 10 to find the total volume:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ \text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. We know that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. Since there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Now we know there are 15 red cards and 24 green cards. The yellow cards are as many as the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now we can find the total number of cards by adding the red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
   - Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.

2. **Calculate the total number of spotted puppies:**
   - Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies.
   - Total number of spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7 spotted puppies.

3. **Calculate the percentage of spotted puppies:**
   - The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100.
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (Number of spotted puppies / Total number of puppies) * 100
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (7 / 20) * 100

4. **Perform the division and multiplication:**

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum them up.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - He buys 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - He buys 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - He buys 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - He buys 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add up the total weight of all the feed:

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans in one week.

She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each aluminum can is worth 2 cents. So, the earnings from aluminum cans in one week are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents per can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from recycling bottles in one week.

She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the earnings from plastic bottles in one week are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents per bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in one week from both cans and bottles combined:
\[ 6 \text{ cents from cans} + 15 \text{ cents from bottles} = 21 \text{ cents per week} \]

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

1. Calculate 60% of Frederick's plants: \( 60\% \times 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \) plants.
2. Add this to Frederick's plants to find out how many plants Toni has: \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) plants.

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball cards and the baseball cards together:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If her students got ten cards each, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student received:

\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Becky received a $1 discount, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10 percent of 10 dollars:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the final amount Kelly paid is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: There are twice as many pillow cases as sheets. So, for each room, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: There are twice as many towels as pillow cases. So, for each room, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total pieces of laundry per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms is:
\(15 \times 80 = 1200\)

So, the final numerical answer is 1200."
"First, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes Fireman Frank has after Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

He starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. So, after Monday, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. After Wednesday, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. After Friday, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

Now, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, after Saturday, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can make with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans are needed for 48 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes per pan}} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks.
2. According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus two extra. So, the number of cookies is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).
3. We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 3
   \]
5. Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches since the remoras' measurements are given in inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark's length is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:
2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches (the combined length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches).

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

In this case:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10\% \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
2. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Since this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
   \]
3. To find the total number of students, we need to solve for the total number of students. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
   \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"First, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk in total to break in the shoes. We know it takes 240 minutes.

Jason wants to break in the shoes in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason plans to walk 4 days a week. So, in 3 weeks, he will walk:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he plans to walk:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes per day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we need to divide these books equally among her 4 kids.

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child got 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This principle helps us avoid counting the same kids more than once when we add the kids allergic to dairy and the kids allergic to peanuts.

First, let's identify the numbers given:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Kids allergic to both: 3

We need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts or both} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts or both} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Now, we know there are 32 kids in total. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both from the total number of kids:

\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts or both} \]

\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, so the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie needs three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then find the number of guests for which these costs are equal.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per person is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. So, we set the two costs equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides to isolate the terms with \( n \) on one side:
   \[
   200 = 25n - 5n
   \]
   \[
   200 = 20n
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{200}{20}
   \]
   \[
   n = 10
   \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. It's also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
4. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4D + 7 = 43
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   4D = 36
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   D = 9
   \]
8. Now we know David found 9 insects. To find out how many insects Lily found, we use the expression \( D + 7 \):
   \[
   D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's find out how many yards of yarn Mariah used. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Yards Mariah used} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's find out how many yards of yarn her grandma used. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Yards her grandma used} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

\[ \text{Total yards used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 273 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends.

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each. So, for these 2 friends, the total number of gifts is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
- The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, for these 3 friends, the total number of gifts is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends together:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these 10 gifts to the 16 gifts she bought for her friends:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[26\]"
"First, let's find out the width of the rug. The problem states that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

Next, we need to find out how long the couch is. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We already know the width of the rug is 8 feet, so we can calculate twice the width of the rug:

Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 feet
Twice the width of the rug = 16 feet

Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

Length of the couch = Twice the width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet. Let's put the final answer in a line:

18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. We know the following:
- Two packs were strawberry.
- One pack was grape.
- One pack was green apple.

The cost of the grape pack is given as $2.

The green apple pack cost half as much as the grape pack. So, the cost of the green apple pack is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as \( x \). Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for the strawberry packs is:
\[ 2x \]

The total cost for all the gum is $7. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's find out how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece gives him 200 sticks.

\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Next, let's find out how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks.

\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. This will give him the most sticks.

The most popsicle sticks he can make is 1200."
"First, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, Mario needs 6 pairs of snowshoes.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, and Mario needs 6 pairs.

So, the total cost is:

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$72.00 \]"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's find out how much Janet spends on bus trips each week:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 days a week.

So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.

To find out how much she would save by buying the pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information given.

Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_o \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let \( S_p \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the information given:
\[ 4(S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]
\[ 4(S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Now, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \):
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes combined.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to lose 30 pounds by July 19th.

First, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, we can calculate the total calories as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Let's count the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these days together:

\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to reach his goal of burning 105,000 calories in 190 days. We do this by dividing the total calories by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} = 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to burn approximately 553 calories each day to reach his goal.

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{553} \]"

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to find out the total distance Hannah will run. She is told to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km. So, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, we multiply the total distance she will run by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:

\[ 120 \text{ ml} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = \$100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ \$500 - \$100 = \$400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = \$100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ \$400 - \$100 = \$300 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Julie has left is $300."
"Let's call the cost of the lot ""L"" and the cost of the house ""H"". According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by using the first equation:

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90,000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many canvas bags Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags in each pack:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Tara spent on the bags. She bought 8 packs at $4 each, so we multiply the number of packs by the price per pack:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pack} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Tara earned from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times 8 \text{ dollars/bag} = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 320 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tara's profit is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. So, the amount he gives to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount he uses for dinner is:

"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device. She consumes 12 kilowatts per hour.

Next, let's calculate her daily consumption after adding the new device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 14 \text{ kW/h/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 98 \text{ kW/h/week} \]

The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50, so her weekly bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = 84 \text{ kW/h/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$126 \]

Her weekly bill after adding the new device is:
\[ 98 \text{ kW/h/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$147 \]

Now, let's find the difference between her weekly bills before and after adding the new device:

"First, let's determine how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

So, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Now, if we have 5 people working together, the amount of the house they can paint in one day is:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \times 2 = 1 \text{ house}
\]

Since they can paint half a house in one day, to paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[
1 \text{ day}
\]

Now, we need to convert this into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take:

\[
1 \text{ day} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 24 \text{ hours}

1. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \( C_O = 20 + 2 = 22 \).
   - So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

2. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).
   - Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
   - According to the problem, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).
   - So, Jenna has 64 sofas.

3. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.
   - The total number of sofas is \( 20 + 64 = 84 \).
   - The total number of chairs is \( 22 + 66 = 88 \).

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount Tom paid to find out how much money he had left for CDs.
3. Divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs he could have bought.

Let's start with step 1. The total amount Tom paid is $48, and he spent $4 on a CD. So, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]
So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount to find out how much money Tom had left for CDs:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]
So, Tom had $4 left for CDs.

Now, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs he could have bought:
\[ 4 \div 4 = 1 \]
So, Tom could have bought 1 more CD with the remaining money.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to add up the hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all these hours to get the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus = Initial people - people who got off + people who got on
- People on the bus = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than the number who got off, which means they get on 1/3 of the number who got off, which is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus = People after first stop - people who got off + people who got on
- People on the bus = 80 - 21 + 7 = 66

Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.
   - So, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - So, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is 22 years old now.
   - His cousin is 47 years old now.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

So, the final numerical answer is 25 years."
"First, let's find out how much Errol paid for the printer. We know that he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. Since the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:

\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors. We know the total cost was $2,400. So, if we let the cost of one monitor be \( x \), then the cost of two monitors would be \( 2x \). The equation for the total cost is:

\[ 1100 + 700 + 2x = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2x = 2400 \]

To find \( 2x \), we subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2x = 600 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ x = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars. Let's confirm this by checking the total cost:

\[ 1100 \text{ (computer)} + 700 \text{ (printer)} + 2 \times 300 \text{ (monitors)} = 1100 + 700 + 600 = 2400 \]

The total cost matches the given total, so our answer is correct. The cost of one monitor is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

So, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years old

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8 years old

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:

First, add 31 and 50:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

She has made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week
- 21 vlogs in the second week
- 15 vlogs in the third week

So, the total vlogs she has made so far is:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

She needs to make 72 vlogs in total, so the number of vlogs she still needs to make is:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

To find 20% of $50, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Tip} = \text{Total Bill} \times \frac{\text{Tip Percentage}}{100} \]

So,
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

The tip is $10.

Now, to find out how much you ended up paying, you need to add the tip to the total bill:
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Total Bill} + \text{Tip} \]

So,
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, you ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. Each boy gets:
   \[

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the days into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let's assume Elvis saves \( x \) dollars in the first half of the month.**
   - Therefore, in the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars per day.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the month:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)
   - Total savings for the month: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)

5. **Set up the equation to match Elvis's target:**
   - Elvis's target is $1125.
   - Therefore, \( 45x = 1125 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

7. **Determine the savings for the second half of the month:**
   - Savings per day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

"First, let's calculate the cost of the apples. Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each:
\[ 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the oranges. Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each:
\[ 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the peaches. Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each:
\[ 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[ 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from $20:

"Let's call the amount Brad gets ""B"" dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets ""4B"" dollars.

The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Alphabet Length**: The English alphabet has 26 letters.

2. **First Two Times Writing the Alphabet**: Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. So, she writes:
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Writing Half of the Alphabet**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 letters is:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ letters}
   \]

4. **Total Letters Written So Far**: Adding the letters from the first two times and the half of the alphabet:
   \[
   52 \text{ letters} + 13 \text{ letters} = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]

5. **Rewriting Everything Already Written**: Elise then re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes the 52 letters she wrote twice plus the 13 letters she wrote once:
   \[
   52 \text{ letters} \times 2 + 13 \text{ letters} = 104 \text{ letters} + 13 \text{ letters} = 117 \text{ letters}

"First, let's determine how many toys James's play set needs to be five times larger than his current 80 toys.

James's play set has 80 toys. If we want a play set five times larger, we calculate:
\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

So, James's play set needs 400 toys to be five times larger.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set needs 400 toys, Jonathan needs:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} \]

Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. This can be written as:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- One notebook costs $1.50, so five notebooks cost \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- One pen costs $0.25, so two pens cost \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- One calculator costs $12.
- One geometry set costs $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means Daniel will only pay 90% of the total cost. So, we calculate 90% of $20.00:

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
   \[
   \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300
   \]

2. For the amount over $1000, which is $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30%.
   \[
   \text{Additional commission for the next } \$1500 = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150
   \]

3. The total commission is the sum of the two parts.
   \[
   \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450

"First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it's cold. So, we calculate twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water and then add 2 minutes:

\[ 2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes per mile} = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:

\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Substituting the size of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. Let's write the final answer:

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we know Octavia drinks half of that amount. Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \). So, Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Next, we know that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to the doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended daily intake from the current intake:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups. Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \). However, if we assume the daily recommended intake \( R \) is 8 cups (a common daily recommended intake), then:

\[ 5R = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

First, we know that 3 cages have 10 hamsters each. So, the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters per cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters} \]

Next, we know that the other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each. So, the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ guinea pigs per cage} = 15 \text{ guinea pigs} \]

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
\[ 30 \text{ hamsters} + 15 \text{ guinea pigs} = 45 \text{ rodents} \]

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

Mark's weight = 150 pounds
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

Susan's weight = 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds
- Susan weighs 130 pounds
- Bob weighs 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up their weights and divide by the number of friends (which is 3):

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the angle of the sun changes over time. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour upward from the pyramid. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to calculate the angle after 10 hours.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid each hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(10 \times 5 = 50\) degrees upward from the pyramid.

So, the angle of the sun from the ground after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

82"
"First, let's find out the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

So, the ages of the sons are 12 and 8 years old.

James wants to buy a candle for each of his sons, so he needs 2 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the number of candles he needs by the number of candles in a pack:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \]

Since he can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 1 pack (which has 5 candles) and then buy an additional pack to get the 2 extra candles he needs.

So, James needs to buy 2 packs of candles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pack} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount James spends on candles is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, we calculate:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes Judy read in the second week. We know she read a total of 100 pages in the second week. We are given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes her to read 1 page, we divide 1.5 minutes by 2 pages:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ pages}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes/page} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes it takes her to read 100 pages, we multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by 100:
\[ 0.75 \text{ minutes/page} \times 100 \text{ pages} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Now we add the minutes she read in the first week and the second week to find the total number of minutes she read in two weeks:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} + 75 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since we know she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 180 minutes. First, we find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 180 minutes:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 120 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5 minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total number of pages she read:
\[ 120 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Now, let's add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current Age of Shiloh**: Shiloh is 44 years old today.

2. **Age of Shiloh in 7 Years**: 
   \[
   44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Age of Shiloh's Nephew in 7 Years**: Let's denote the nephew's current age as \( x \). In 7 years, the nephew's age will be:
   \[
   x + 7
   \]

4. **Given Condition**: In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.
   \[
   51 = 3 \times (x + 7)
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   51 = 3(x + 7)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   17 = x + 7
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - So, for three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - The amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00.
   - Half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   - So, for each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's add up all the money the tooth fairy gave Sharon:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total money given by the tooth fairy:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine how many goals Mark and Anna scored based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:

\[ \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:

\[ \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we know the number of goals each teenager scored:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Mark scored 60 goals.
- Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual goals together:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Mitchell made selling lemonade.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we calculate Mitchell's earnings as follows:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we can calculate the daily spending as follows:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{\$70}{7 \text{ days}} = \$10 \text{ per day} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for these 4 days is:

\[ \text{Total cost for wooden action figures} = 4 \text{ days} \times \$5 \text{ per figure} = \$20 \]

After spending $20 on wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = \$70 - \$20 = \$50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $50 is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{\$50}{\$2 \text{ per figure}} = 25 \text{ figures} \]

Now, we need to find out how many wooden action figures Peter bought. Since each wooden action figure costs $5 and he spent $20 on wooden action figures, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{\$20}{\$5 \text{ per figure}} = 4 \text{ figures} \]

Finally, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 \text{ wooden figures} + 25 \text{ plastic figures} = 29 \text{ figures} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{29} \]"

Now, let's calculate the cost of the broken 4 vases:
- Cost per vase: $12
- Number of vases: 4
- Total cost for broken vases: $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Spaying cost: $200
- Vaccines cost: $60
- Broken vases cost: $48

Total cost = $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

The final numerical answer is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops in a week.
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops in a month.
4. Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.
5. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford needs and the total number of roses he supplies in a month.

Let's start with step 1:
Ford grows 40 roses every week.

For step 2, we need to add up the roses supplied to the flower shops:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied to the flower shops in a week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

For step 3, we need to calculate the total number of roses supplied in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

For step 4, we need to calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply in a month. Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

For step 5, we find the difference between the total number of roses Ford needs and the total number of roses he supplies in a month:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much money Katina will have left after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Katina will remove from her account over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times $100/\text{month} = $2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[ $3000 - $2400 = $600 \]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ $600 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf. Since 10 sandwiches can be made from 1 loaf of bread, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Cost of bread} = \$3.00 \]

The cost of different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches. They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

So, the net profit is:
\[ \boxed{37} \]"
"First, let's find out how many crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
- The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
- Area = length × width = 18 feet × 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
- The padding costs $2 per square foot.
- Total cost for new carpet and padding = (12 + 2) × 216 = 14 × 216 = $3024.

Now, we'll calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
- The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
- Cost to remove the old carpet = 4 × 216 = $864.

Finally, we'll calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
- The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.
- Cost to install the new carpet = 34 × 216 = $7344.

Now, we'll add up all the costs:
- Cost of new carpet and padding = $3024
- Cost to remove the old carpet = $864
- Cost to install the new carpet = $7344
- Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."

1. **Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:**
   - Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

   Adding these together:
   \[
   50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280
   \]

2. **Count the number of days Mack counted birds:**
   - Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7
   - Total number of days: 6

3. **Calculate the average number of birds seen per day:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. We can denote this as \( x = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This operation involves adding half of the starting value to the starting value and then dividing the result by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

3. **Second Operation**: This operation involves multiplying the result of the first operation by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result of the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is 48.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees temperature that the recipe calls for.

To find the actual temperature that corresponds to 520 degrees, we need to find what temperature would be 4% off from 520 degrees. This means the actual temperature is 96% of 520 degrees (since 100% - 4% = 96%).

So, we calculate:
\[ 520 \times 0.96 = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 499.2 degrees to get the actual temperature of 520 degrees as per her recipe.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 499.2 \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies together.

First movie length: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Second movie length: 2 hours and 5 minutes

We can convert these times into just minutes to make the addition easier.

1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2 hours = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than $76,000. This means we need to find 70% of $76,000 because 100% - 30% = 70%.

First, we calculate 70% of $76,000:
\[ 70\% \text{ of } 76,000 = \frac{70}{100} \times 76,000 = 0.70 \times 76,000 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we need to find the combined value of both houses:
\[ \text{Value of Juan's house} + \text{Value of Herb's house} = 53,200 + 76,000 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen means 12 cups.
   - So, Judy bought 12 cups.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups.
   - Since she bought 12 cups, the number of dishes is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

3. **Determine the number of cups Judy's friend brought:**
   - Judy's friend brought 40 cups.

4. **Determine the number of dishes Judy's friend brought:**
   - Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy.
   - Since Judy's friend brought 24 dishes, the number of dishes her friend brought is \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

5. **Calculate the total number of cups brought by both:**
   - Judy brought 12 cups.
   - Her friend brought 40 cups.
   - Total cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\) cups.

6. **Calculate the total number of dishes brought by both:**
   - Judy brought 24 dishes.
   - Her friend brought 44 dishes.
   - Total dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\) dishes.

7. **Calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both:**
   - Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes
   - Total utensils = \(52 + 68 = 120\)

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's find out how much one box of contacts costs after the discount.

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, Pete buys 2 boxes. The total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Pete will have 180 pairs of contacts. To find the cost per pair, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 1.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"

\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Since Tabitha agreed to pay $10 an hour, John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how many 200 calorie units are in 1600 calories:
- Number of 200 calorie units in 1600 calories = 1600 calories / 200 calories/unit = 8 units.

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:
- Total water needed = 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml.

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of red jelly beans can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to add up all three measurements and then divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
After some lessons, his speed increased to 52 WPM.
If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add these three speeds together:
47 + 52 + 57

Let's do the addition:
47 + 52 = 99
99 + 57 = 156

So, the total of the three measurements is 156 WPM.

To find the average, we divide the total by 3:
156 ÷ 3 = 52

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people Alex will have at the event. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends.
   - So, the number of friends invited by these 100 people is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Additional Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these 10 friends bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of spouses brought by these 8 friends is 8.

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - Alex's initial 100 people.
   - The 200 friends invited by the initial 100 people.
   - The 10 friends Alex called.
   - The 8 spouses brought by the 8 friends.

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318 \]

So, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find the weight of the Dachshund. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Since the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund weighs:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find the weight of the Papillon. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs 20 pounds, the Papillon weighs:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we find the weight of the Mastiff. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Since the Papillon weighs 5 pounds, the Mastiff weighs:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds. Let's box the final answer.

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

So, the total cost on Amazon is:
\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total cost on eBay is:
\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.

The difference in cost is:
\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

- Day 0: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- Day 1: The beanstalk doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- Day 2: The beanstalk doubles to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- Day 3: The beanstalk doubles to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

We can see that on Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet of Mark's window.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, we can calculate the protein in 200 grams by doubling the protein in 100 grams.

2. Protein in 200 grams of mushrooms = 3 grams of protein * 2 = 6 grams of protein.

3. Now, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week).

4. Protein in a week = 6 grams of protein * 7 days = 42 grams of protein.

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( J \).
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( J - 5 \).
3. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age five years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2 \times (J - 5)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
   \[
   J - 2J = -10
   \]
   \[
   -J = -10
   \]
   \[
   J = 10
   \]
   So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

5. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13
   \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the two implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, let's find out how many gumballs Colby can buy with the quarters. Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is equivalent to 5 pennies, we need to convert the quarters into pennies.

Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equal to 25 pennies, we can calculate the total number of pennies from the quarters as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ pennies/quarter} = 200 \text{ pennies} \]

Next, we need to convert the dimes and nickels into pennies as well. Each dime is worth 10 pennies, and each nickel is worth 5 pennies.

Colby has 6 dimes, so the total number of pennies from the dimes is:
\[ 6 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ pennies/dime} = 60 \text{ pennies} \]

Colby has 14 nickels, so the total number of pennies from the nickels is:
\[ 14 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ pennies/nickel} = 70 \text{ pennies} \]

Now, we add up all the pennies Colby has:
\[ 200 \text{ pennies (from quarters)} + 60 \text{ pennies (from dimes)} + 70 \text{ pennies (from nickels)} + 15 \text{ pennies (from pennies)} = 445 \text{ pennies} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 pennies, we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total number of pennies by 5:
\[ \frac{445 \text{ pennies}}{5 \text{ pennies/gumball}} = 89 \text{ gumballs} \]

So, Colby can buy 89 gumballs. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 89 \]"
"To find the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Now, we add up all the legs:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"First, let's find out what 50% of the 8-pound weight is.

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, Jamaal finds the new weight to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds. The weight he now uses is:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem year by year.

**Year 1:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year.
- In a year, he buys 12 games.
- So, at the end of the first year, he has \(5 + 12 = 17\) games.

**Year 2:**
- He starts the year with 17 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for a year.
- In a year, he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
- So, at the end of the second year, he has \(17 + 24 = 41\) games.

**Year 3:**
- He starts the year with 41 games.
- He buys 4 games per month for a year.
- In a year, he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.

So, the final number of games Steve has after 3 years is 94."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the plane. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find the amount he makes in one hour:

\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in one hour. We add Ruiz's and Marissa's hourly rates:

\[ \text{Total rate} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} + 45 \text{ pounds per hour} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

They worked for 12 hours in a day, so we multiply their total hourly rate by 12 to find the total amount of chocolates they made together in a day:

\[ \text{Total pounds} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate how much he spends each day and then subtract the total from his original amount.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, so he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, so he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount he spends over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each part of the time he worked and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- He sold for 4 hours.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

So, the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- He sold for 2 hours.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

So, the total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next 2 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

"First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in total for Jeremy's monthly driving.

Given:
- The car drives 400 miles a month.
- For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.

So, for 400 miles, the tires rotate:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations:
\[ 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we need to find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

Let's calculate the number of months:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per tire}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years this is:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many washes Jackie can get from one pump of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps give 120 washes. So, 1 pump will give half the number of washes, which is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Now, we know that the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. We need to find out how much each pump costs in dollars. Since 1 pump gives 60 washes, we can calculate the cost of 1 pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{2 \text{ pumps}} = \$12.00 \text{ per pump} \]

To convert this cost into cents, we know that $1.00 is equal to 100 cents. Therefore:

\[ \$12.00 = 12 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, each pump costs 1200 cents. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discount on the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% off sale.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the shorts will cost:
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has:

\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a day. He wants to make 4 dozen a day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will make \(4 \times 7 = 28\) dozen croissants in a week.

3. We know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, to find out how much butter he needs for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
   \[
   28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7
   \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants in a week.

2. Calculate the total number of posts per day by multiplying the number of members by the average number of posts each member makes per day.
3. Multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March to get the total number of posts in March.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of days in March = 31
2. Total posts per day = Number of members * Average posts per member per day
   = 1000 members * 3 posts/member/day
   = 3000 posts/day
3. Total posts in March = Total posts per day * Number of days in March
   = 3000 posts/day * 31 days
   = 93000 posts

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, let's find out how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, we can calculate the number of loads per year by multiplying the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year:

\[ \text{Loads per year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total gallons of water used in a year. Since each load uses 20 gallons of water, we multiply the number of loads by the gallons per load:

\[ \text{Total gallons per year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the water used in a year. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:

\[ \text{Total cost per year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks:
Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each.
\[ 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral:
Scarlett bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each.
\[ 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fish:
Scarlett bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \]

The cost of the fish food is given as:
\[ 2.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of the aquarium: $10.00
- Cost of the rocks: $5.00
- Cost of the coral: $6.00
- Cost of the fish: $10.00
- Cost of the fish food: $2.00

Adding these together:
\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00 \]

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is:
\[ \boxed{33.00} \]"

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's find out how much meat Prince can sell in one day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. So, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750kg of meat from the bull. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount of meat he sells in one day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:**
   - There are 4 rows of seats.
   - Each row has 18 seats.
   - Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

2. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:**
   - One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.
   - Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats.

3. **Calculate the number of seats remaining after the administrators:**
   - Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.

4. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:**
   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
   - Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats.

5. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students:**
   - The rest of the seats were occupied by the students.
   - Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats.

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"First, let's find out how many street lights are there in total. Each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Since there are 4 intersections, we can calculate the total number of street lights as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of street lights} = \text{Number of poles per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections} \times \text{Number of street lights per pole} \]

\[ \text{Total number of street lights} = 6 \times 4 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Total number of street lights} = 96 \]

Now, we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:

\[ \text{Number of functioning street lights} = \text{Total number of street lights} - \text{Number of non-functioning street lights} \]

\[ \text{Number of functioning street lights} = 96 - 20 \]

\[ \text{Number of functioning street lights} = 76 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's find out how many more times each DVD can be played before it breaks.

For the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has been played 356 times.
- So, the number of times it can still be played is \(1000 - 356 = 644\) times.

For the second DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has been played 135 times.
- So, the number of times it can still be played is \(1000 - 135 = 865\) times.

Now, let's add the remaining play counts of both DVDs to find the total number of times they can be played before they break.

Total number of times both DVDs can be played:
- First DVD: 644 times
- Second DVD: 865 times

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, we add these to the pieces he chewed during school:

\[
4 \text{ pieces} + 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Jim started with a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Then, Jim gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed. So, we calculate half of the 14 pieces:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

After giving 7 pieces to his sister, the number of pieces Jim has left is:

\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age.

If Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 years from her age in the future to find her current age:
\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

Now, to find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final numerical answer is 8."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
   - There are 3 days in this period.
   - So, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Remaining days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday):**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than the first three days.
   - Since it pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, it pulled:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - There are 3 days in this period.
   - So, the total number of cars pulled in the remaining days is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the requirement. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Adam's height in feet = 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.3333 feet

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet.

So, Adam needs to grow 4 feet - 3.3333 feet = 0.6667 feet more to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert 0.6667 feet to inches to find out how many years it will take for him to grow that much. There are 12 inches in a foot.

0.6667 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8 inches

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches. Since he grows 2 inches per year:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the 10 cars James sold. Each car costs $25,000, so:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the cost the company paid for the 10 cars is:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.30 = 75,000 \]

Now, we need to find out the profit James made. The profit is the total cost of the cars minus the cost the company paid:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. We know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. We know that 60% of the 25 riders are women.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

Now, to find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the price of the gold jewel.
2. Find the price of the silver jewel.
3. Add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels together.

First, we know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we know the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, we calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels together to find the total price:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}

"To find out how many stamps Max bought in all, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp he bought and then add them together.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the rate at which he is closing the gap:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final number of fish Tommy caught is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much each class costs and then determine how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's find out the cost per class. Manny paid $60 for 10 classes. So, the cost per class is:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Now, we know that the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10. Therefore, Manny's parents will not sign him up again because the cost per class is not more than $10.

Since the cost per class is already $6, Manny can miss all 10 classes and still not exceed the $10 per class limit. So, the number of classes Manny can miss is:

\[ 10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many customers Julie and Jewel process in a day, and then calculate their total weekly production.

First, let's determine how many customers Jewel processes in a day. According to the problem, Jewel processes 50 customers a day.

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, we can calculate how many customers Julie processes in a day by multiplying Jewel's daily customer count by 2:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customer count} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Now, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers a day and Julie processes 100 customers a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how far Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30.

For oranges:
- Three oranges cost $3.30.
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

So, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig and then determine how long it will take him to dig it.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:
\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to dig the hole, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to dig one cubic foot:
\[ \text{Time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the raise.

Tim's original monthly salary is $20000. A 5% raise means he gets an additional 5% of $20000.

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, Tim gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half a month's salary is:

\[ \text{Bonus} = 20000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):

\[ \text{Total yearly salary} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 372000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the cost of a pair of dress pants is:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. So, the total number of dress shirts he buys is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"

"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since Steve is 60 years old and his wife is 4 years older, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Steve's son is. The problem states that his son is half as old as his mom. Since his mom is 64 years old, we can calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's age} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Steve's son's wife is. The problem states that his son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. Since Steve's son is 32 years old, we can calculate his wife's age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \]

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much flour is in one bag.
2. Multiply the amount of flour in one bag by three.

First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find out how much flour is in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Alisa biked. We know that Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how many miles Stanley biked. We know that Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add the distances together:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil and the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay:
Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many likes Fishio had after three weeks. We know that after 1 week, she had 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we calculate the likes after three weeks as follows:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, Fishio had 140,000 likes. Now, we are told that she received 20,000 more likes recently. To find the total number of likes now, we add these 20,000 likes to the 140,000 likes she had after three weeks:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes Fishio has now is:

\[ 160000 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount because of the voucher.
So, the final cost for Clara on Tuesday is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
So, the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats because the sales from red hats were half the sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - The total sales in two months were the sum of the sales in the first and second months.
   - Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is \( 2100 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is:
- The first hour is $15.
- Each hour after that is twice the cost of the first hour.

So, the cost for the first hour is $15.
The cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
The cost for the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, let's add up the costs for the 3 hours he pays for:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Sally has in her bank account at the end of the week.
2. Determine how much money Sally should have in her bank account if she had received her full wage.
3. Subtract the amount she should have from the amount she actually has to find out how much was withheld.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
2. If Sally had received her full weekly wage of $300, her bank account would have been $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $520.
3. The difference between what she should have and what she actually has is $520 - $420 = $100.

So, $100 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, we can calculate the total number of deviled egg halves as follows:

\[
16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. We know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. Therefore, we can calculate the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
\]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we can find the number of dozens by dividing the total number of whole eggs by 12:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen}
\]

So, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we first need to calculate how many pages she has already written. She has written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper.

So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

This means Shiela has written 5 pages. Now, to find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

So, we calculate:
\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. If the book is 200 pages long, we can find out how many days it will take him to finish by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading in 20 days. 

The number of days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading is:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel. The cost to rent the hanger is $5000 a month. The cost for fuel is twice that, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 a month.

Now, let's add the cost of renting the hanger and the cost of fuel to find the total monthly cost:
$5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 a month.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Now, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total yearly cost of renting and maintaining it:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (rent and maintenance) = $330,000.

So, the final numerical answer is $330,000."
"First, let's find out how long it took to cook pork. We know it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, we can calculate the time for pork as follows:

\[ \text{Time to cook pork} = \text{Time to cook rice} + 20 \]
\[ \text{Time to cook pork} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took to cook beans. We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we need to find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:

\[ \text{Combined cooking time of pork and rice} = \text{Time to cook pork} + \text{Time to cook rice} \]
\[ \text{Combined cooking time of pork and rice} = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the time it took to cook beans:

\[ \text{Time to cook beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Combined cooking time of pork and rice} \]
\[ \text{Time to cook beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add up the times to cook all the food:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to cook rice} + \text{Time to cook pork} + \text{Time to cook beans} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- A pound of almonds costs $10.
- A pound of walnuts costs $15.
- The first mixture is 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the second mixture is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's use some basic algebra. We know that sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's say the number of sheep is \( S \) and the number of geese is \( G \).

From the information given:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20, so \( S + G = 20 \).
2. The total number of animal legs is 70, so \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is 15.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now let's check the legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The numbers match the given conditions, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, we do the following calculation:

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered in a day - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

First, subtract the newspapers to District A from the total:

600 - 198 = 402

Then, subtract the newspapers to District C from the result:

402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final numerical answer is 193."

"First, let's find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find this number, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia: $120
- Kassidy: $90
- Rayna: $150

To find out how much money they would have if they added together their money and shared it equally, we first need to find the total amount of money they have together:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Christina recorded her moods over 30 days. We are given the following information:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

We can calculate the number of neutral days by subtracting the number of good and bad days from the total number of days:
\[ \text{Total days} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Good days} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Bad days} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Neutral days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]

Next, we are told the distribution of moods over the first 24 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

So, the number of good days in the first 24 days is:
\[ \text{Good days in first 24 days} = 8 \]

The number of bad days in the first 24 days is:
\[ \text{Bad days in first 24 days} = 8 \]

The number of neutral days in the first 24 days is:
\[ \text{Neutral days in first 24 days} = 10 \]

Now, we are given the moods for the last 6 days:
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

So, the number of good days in the last 6 days is:
\[ \text{Good days in last 6 days} = 3 \]

The number of bad days in the last 6 days is:
\[ \text{Bad days in last 6 days} = 0 \]

The number of neutral days in the last 6 days is:
\[ \text{Neutral days in last 6 days} = 3 \]

To find the total number of good days in the month, we add the good days from the first 24 days to the good days in the last 6 days:
\[ \text{Total good days} = 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

3. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \). So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   21 = 2S + 3
   \]
4. To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   21 - 3 = 2S

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the current height in inches is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and its current height is 240 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required for it to grow 360 inches is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He has 4 dogs and 4 toys, so each dog has one toy. Now, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys. That means he needs 4 (current toys) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 toys.

After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he had 4 dogs when he left, twice as many more dogs means 4 * 2 = 8 more dogs. So, he needs to buy toys for these 8 additional dogs. That means he needs 12 (current toys) + 8 (additional dogs) = 20 toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. So, he needs to subtract the 3 dogs that left. That means he needs 20 (current toys) - 3 (dogs that left) = 17 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

So, Dylan invested $480. Now, let's find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment.

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

So, Frances invested $480. Now, let's find out how much money is left after Frances's investment.

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

"First, let's find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So, together they have:

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Karen earns in one day if she works 3 hours. We do this by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We do this by multiplying her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns $120 in two days if she works 3 hours per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion because the number of potatoes and the number of hash browns are directly proportional.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's find out the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

An adult weighs an average of 80 kg. So, the weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Now, add Jack's weight to this total. Jack weighs 80 kg, so the total weight is:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add up the cookies each of them has:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

Let's add these numbers:

68 + 73 = 141
141 + 61 = 202
202 + 96 = 298

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298.

The final numerical answer is 298."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm.
2. Shania decides to extend the dress by 50% of its original length. So, the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm.
3. After extending the dress, she adds 20 cm to the bottom with a lace trim.
4. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

2. Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

3. Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the speeds of the lawn mower in both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the lawn in 40 minutes.

Chris decides to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode. So, he mows 30 minutes in ""turtle"" mode and 30 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to mow each half:
- In ""turtle"" mode, mowing half the lawn takes 30 minutes.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, mowing half the lawn takes 30 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time for each half:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 60 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's add up the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the library and then to the fire station.

Time to the library: 6 minutes
Time to the fire station: 13 minutes

Total time spent: 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school.

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - She bought 1 kilo of apples for $4.

2. **Bananas:**
   - She bought 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of 1 kilo of bananas = $2
   - Cost of 2 kilos of bananas = 2 * $2 = $4

3. **Oranges:**
   - She bought 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of 1 kilo of oranges = $3
   - Cost of 2 kilos of oranges = 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:

- Cost of apples = $4
- Cost of bananas = $4
- Cost of oranges = $6

Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of **$14**."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda bakes. Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times \text{Cookies baked by Greta} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's add the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda together:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies baked by Greta} + \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Next, they eat 10 cookies while they are cooling. So, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's call the age of one twin \( T \) and the age of one triplet \( T_3 \).

2. According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. So, we can write this as:
   \[
   T = T_3 + 7
   \]

3. We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can write:
   \[
   T + T + T_3 + T_3 = 44
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2T + 2T_3 = 44
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
   \[
   T + T_3 = 22
   \]

4. Now we have two equations:
   \[
   T = T_3 + 7
   \]
   \[
   T + T_3 = 22
   \]

5. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( T \) with \( T_3 + 7 \):
   \[
   (T_3 + 7) + T_3 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2T_3 + 7 = 22
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2T_3 = 15
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   T_3 = 7.5
   \]

6. Now that we know \( T_3 = 7.5 \), we can find \( T \) using the first equation:
   \[
   T = T_3 + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5
   \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 14.5 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14.5}

- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time John has before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's find out the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many coins Rong saves per month. Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{2 \times 20}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[
20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many coins each of them has after 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are:

\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves:

\[
20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves:

\[
28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, let's isolate \( T \) on one side:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the cost of each type of fruit:

- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. White squares: 24 (green) - 12 = 12

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12

Let's calculate the total:

Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area is 68 square feet.

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can haul. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as \( G \). The total capacity of the three trucks is the sum of their individual capacities:

\[ \text{Total capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} \]
\[ 11600 = 4000 + 4800 + G \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 11600 = 8800 + G \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. So, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then determine how many more hours they need to raise that amount.

1. First, we know the total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. So, the amount left to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. They need to raise $4200 more and they raise an equal amount every hour.
5. Since they raise $2100 in 3 hours, they raise $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.
6. To find out how many more hours they need to raise $4200, we divide $4200 by $700 per hour.

Let's calculate the number of hours needed:

\[ \text{Number of hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to raise for a total of 3 (already raised) + 6 (remaining) = 9 hours.

The final numerical answer is 9 hours."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Water from the Colorado River**: We can consider the total water from the Colorado River as 100% for simplicity.

2. **Water Used by Colorado City**: Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. So, 40% of the total water is used by Colorado City.

3. **Water Used for Industrial Purposes by Colorado City**: 80% of the water used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes. So, 80% of the 40% used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes.

4. **Water Used for Non-Industrial Purposes by Colorado City**: The remaining 20% of the water used by Colorado City is used for non-industrial purposes. This is because 100% - 80% = 20%.

5. **Percentage of Total Water Used for Non-Industrial Purposes by Colorado City**: Since 20% of the water used by Colorado City is for non-industrial purposes, and Colorado City uses 40% of the total water, we need to find out what 20% of 40% is.

To find 20% of 40%, we calculate:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 40\% = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 0.20 \times 40 = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the total water from the Colorado River is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to calculate how much she charges for one week and then multiply that by 2.

1. Calculate the cost for one week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - So, for one week, the cost is \(7 \times 12 = 84\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost for two weeks:
   - We already know that one week costs $84.
   - For two weeks, the cost is \(84 \times 2 = 168\) dollars.

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes per hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \) quarts.

Now, let's calculate how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \) quarts/hour * \( 48 \) hours = \( 2400 \) quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \) quarts/hour * \( 48 \) hours = \( 600 \) quarts.

Finally, to find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours:
- \( 2400 \) quarts (chocolate) + \( 600 \) quarts (vanilla) = \( 3000 \) quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

1. Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each
   \[
   5 \times 3.00 = 15.00

2. Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each
   \[
   4 \times 2.50 = 10.00
   \]

3. Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each
   \[
   3 \times 4.00 = 12.00
   \]

4. Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each
   \[
   13 \times 1.00 = 13.00
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00
\]

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his total bill. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $50.00:
\[
0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:
\[
50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00
\]

So, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45.00}

"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 scoop for free. This means for every 3 scoops, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50.

Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops she can get, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with her $6.00.

Let's calculate the number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy:
\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per set}} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \]

So, Erin can buy 4 sets of 3 scoops.

Now, let's calculate the total number of scoops:
\[ \text{Total scoops} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 12 scoops of ice cream."
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, and Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day. So, the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks is:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces, after two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, so in 14 days, she will have eaten:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces, after two weeks, Amy will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total bathroom area.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered:
   - Total bathroom area = 36 sq ft
   - Area to be covered = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 36\)

   Let's calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 36\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

2. Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:
   \[
   24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
   \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries.

He paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking. Then, he paid $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds of blueberries.

So, the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost James to buy the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store.

The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, so:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's find out the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is calculated as:
\[ 10\% \times 700 = \frac{10}{100} \times 700 = 0.1 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese has 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham has 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, to find the total calories in the omelet, we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes in 5 minutes, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's break down the time she spends with her arms raised and when she doesn't:
- She dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- She raises her arms for 2 minutes.
- Therefore, she dances with her arms down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the number of taps for each part of her dance:

1. **With both hands at her sides (3 minutes):**
   - Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
   - Total taps per minute: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps.
   - Total taps in 3 minutes: \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps.

2. **With arms raised (2 minutes):**
   - Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
   - Total taps per minute: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps.
   - Total taps in 2 minutes: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps.

Finally, we add the total taps from both parts of her dance:
\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends), the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each of them had one pizza, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times \frac{24}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. Since each of them had one pizza, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times \frac{36}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:

\[ 16 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 34 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:

"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. So, we need to calculate 2/3 of 30 minutes.

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Calculate the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages
time_for_dog = (2/3) * 30
time_for_dog
```
```output
20.0
```
The dog takes 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes.

The average time is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Calculate the average time
average_time = (30 + 20) / 2
average_time
```
```output

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

So, Topher's shoe length in inches is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

The final numerical answer is:

   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Count the total number of blue spools:**
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light blue spools: 15

   Total blue spools = 45 (dark blue) + 15 (light blue)
   Total blue spools = 45 + 15 = 60

3. **Calculate the percentage of blue spools:**
   The formula to calculate the percentage is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

5. **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. We know that 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted by midday.

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. This means the number of people who hadn't voted by midday is:

\[
5000 - 2000 = 3000
\]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000. So, 2/3 of 3000 people had voted by 16:00:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
\]

So, 2000 people had voted by 16:00. This means the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00 is:

\[
3000 - 2000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we need to find out Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We can do this by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

"First, let's find out how much each of Cindy's books weighs:

- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice as much as her English book, so 2 * 3 pounds = 6 pounds

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

2 (math) + 2 (science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (History) = 17 pounds

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate the votes for candidate B as follows:

Votes for candidate B = Votes for candidate A + 50% of Votes for candidate A
Votes for candidate B = 20% of 100 + 0.5 * 20% of 100
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 0.5 * 20
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10
Votes for candidate B = 30

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We can find out how many votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes:

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - Votes for candidate A - Votes for candidate B
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 20 - 30
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50
Votes for candidate C = 50

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after Boris gives 10 apples to Beck:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples after giving 10} - \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- So, the total water used for giant cubes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

For the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- So, the total water used for medium cubes is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

For the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- So, the total water used for small cubes is \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for medium cubes + water for small cubes
- Total water used = 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 26 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
- Water left = initial water - total water used
- Water left = 32 ounces - 26 ounces = 6 ounces.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now we know Steven has 10 books. Next, we need to find out how many books Alice has. We know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, we add 6 to Steven's books:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now we know Alice has 16 books. We need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. We know the total number of students in the class is 50. We also know the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music. So, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

The number of students who like to bake is 10, the number who like to play basketball is 5, and the number who like to play music is 10. So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many birds were scared away by the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and 1/3 of that number were scared away.

\[ \text{Birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[ \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. So, we add these 20 birds to the 8 remaining birds:

\[ \text{Total birds now} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

So, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school**: 80 students.
2. **Number of classes**: Since the total number of students is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we need to find out how many classes there are. Let's assume there are \( n \) classes. So, the total number of students can be expressed as \( n \times \text{students per class} = 80 \).

Since each class has the same number of students, let's denote the number of students in each class as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
\[ n \times x = 80 \]

3. **Number of students in each class**: Since the total number of students is 80 and there are 2 classes (because 80 divided by 2 is 40), each class has:
\[ x = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

4. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40% of the students in each class are girls. So, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

5. **Number of boys in each class**: Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mara initially had 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. She added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the total number of slices on the plate now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices from the plate. So, the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend then stole 5 slices from the plate. So, the number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to add up all the animals she has to groom this week.

She has:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom in total. Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, let's determine the total value of the cards Mark got from opening the packs. He got 1 card worth $4000, 1 card worth $1000, and 30 cards worth an average of $50 each.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, let's add up the total value of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park.

"First, let's calculate how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day.

He used to buy them for $0.5 each and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the daily cost is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money he spends on tomatoes a day with his new vendor.

He now buys them for $0.4 each and he still sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the daily cost is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves a day, we subtract the new daily cost from the old daily cost:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much money he saves in a week, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. We know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 \]

Now, let's calculate that:

\[ 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

So,

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

To find Cal's marbles, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we know there are 54 students. If we divide these students into 12 groups, we can find the number of students per group by performing the division:

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} \]

Let's do the division:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each group would have 4.5 students if we divide 54 students into 12 groups. However, since we can't have half a student in a group, this division isn't practical in a real-world scenario. But for the purpose of answering the question, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form.

Since the question asks how many more groups are needed to form if the activity is to be divided into 12 groups, and we already know that 12 groups can be formed with 54 students, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(20 \text{ days} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\).
- Total chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(8 \text{ days} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 800 \text{ chairs}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[ 1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs} \]

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[ 2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"First, let's find out how many bananas Gunther had after Arnold stole half of them.

Gunther originally had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so:
\[ \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Bananas left with Gunther} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after Gunther added 25} = 24 + 25 = 49 \]

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas left with Gunther} = 49 - 12 = 37 \]

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost for electricity for all roommates.
2. Calculate the total yearly cost for electricity for all roommates.
3. Divide the yearly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay per year.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total monthly cost for electricity for all roommates is $100.

2. To find the total yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   100 \times 12 = 1200
   \]
   So, the total yearly cost for electricity is $1200.

3. Now, we need to divide the yearly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{4} = 300

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, we subtract these from the total number of glasses and plates sent.

For the glasses:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]

For the plates:
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so 27 small buttons are worth \(27 \div 3 = 9\) large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - After trading 27 small stickers, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button, 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, 20 large buttons are worth \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Adding these up, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is \(9 + 20 + 60 = 89\).

So, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{89}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).
3. The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
4. We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so \( 3x = 33 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3: \( x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \).
6. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

   - 11 students need size extra-small.
   - Number of extra-small shirts = 11.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**

"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - 5% of $140 is found by multiplying $140 by 0.05 (since 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05).
   - So, the discount amount is $140 * 0.05 = $7.

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   - The price after the discount is $140 - $7 = $133.

So, after the discount, you will pay $133."

1. We know that one third of Jana's Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 is one third of the Pomeranian puppies, then the total number of Pomeranian puppies is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, if 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18
   \]
4. To find the total number of puppies, we can solve for the total by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"First, let's find out how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90. Half of $90 is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, Jayden receives $45 from his sister. Now, let's add this to the $70 Jayden already had:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

Now, we know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2/5:

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half of the second house, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) cases of shingles. Therefore, the third house needs \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

100"
"First, let's calculate how much Leila spent on cucumbers:
- Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
- Each cucumber costs $2.
- So, Leila's total cost = 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.

Next, let's calculate how much Jack spent on tomatoes:
- Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
- Each tomato costs $1.
- So, Jack's total cost = 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5.

Now, let's calculate how much Chase spent on lettuce:
- Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
- Each head of lettuce costs $3.
- So, Chase's total cost = 1 head of lettuce * $3/head of lettuce = $3.

Finally, let's add up the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase:
- Total cost = Leila's cost + Jack's cost + Chase's cost
- Total cost = $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

So, the three of them spent a total of $14 to make a salad for the potluck."
"First, let's find out how many more pears George has than bananas. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we calculate 45% of the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas.

Now, let's find out the total number of pears George has. Since he has 200 bananas and 90 more pears, we add these numbers together.

Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears together.

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290 = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

2. Next, find out how much 20 kilograms of oranges cost. If each kilogram of oranges costs $3, then 20 kilograms would cost \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

So, Sam would have to spend 60 dollars to make 4 liters of juice."
"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. According to the question, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing Ezra's books by 2:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, we know Ahmed read 150 books. Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will have read after reading 150 more books:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = \text{Ezra's books in one hour} + 150 = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's total books} + \text{Ahmed's books} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day.
- So, for Monday, she earns \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5 per day.
- So, for Wednesday, she earns \(30\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
- Monday: 80 dollars
- Wednesday: 30 dollars
- Total: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

So, Tanya earned a total of 110 dollars for these two days of teaching.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents each day. Since they have 4 vanilla scents available, they can only sell all 4 of them. So, the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4.

The perfume company sold 2 fruity scents each day. Since they have 8 fruity scents available, they can sell all 8 of them. So, the total number of fruity scents sold is 8.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of vanilla scents sold} - \text{Number of fruity scents sold} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 4 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -4 \]

Since we are asked how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, and the result is negative, it means 4 more fruity scents were sold than vanilla scents.

"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each.
So, the total money from eggplants is:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3 \text{ per eggplant} = \$60 \]

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount of money by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears of corn}} = \$3 \text{ per ear of corn} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

First, we need to find out how much time Tatiana has in total for the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so the total time is:
\[ 7 + 5 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time after reading is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

She plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time after reading. So, the time spent on video games is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer. The total time spent on reading and video games is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time spent playing soccer is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of the weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

"First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \]

So, the number of movies that are not in series is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 40\% \times 400 = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

So, the number of movies that are not older movies is:

\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the non-series movies (both newer and older) is $10 each.

The cost of the series movies is:

So, Winston spent a total of $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed when they hike:**
   - They drive at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - They hike at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - So, their hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance they hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the distance they drove:**
   - They drove for \( 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.
   - They drove at a speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so Ava finishes the level in \( T + 4 \) seconds.

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

Emma's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from time: \( 30T \)
So, Emma's total score is:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Ava's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30(T + 4) = 30T + 120 \)
So, Ava's total score is:
\[ 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T + 215 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T + 215) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:

1. **Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - On three days, they ride their bikes 3 times each day.
   - On the other two days, they ride their bikes twice as many times as they do on the usual days.

2. **Calculate Biking on Three Days:**
   - They ride 3 times each day for 3 days.
   - Total biking on these 3 days = 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.

3. **Calculate Biking on Two Days:**
   - On these two days, they ride twice as many times as they do on the usual days.
   - They ride 3 times each day on usual days, so on these two days, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.
   - Total biking on these 2 days = 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

4. **Total Biking in a Week:**
   - Total biking in a week = Biking on three days + Biking on two days

"First, let's understand the situation. Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then added 17 more fish to his pond, and after adding these, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \). Since he bought 17 fish in total, the number of orange fish he bought would be \( 17 - w \).

After adding these 17 fish to his original 7 fish, the total number of fish in the pond became \( 7 + 17 = 24 \).

Now, the number of orange fish in the pond is \( 3 + (17 - w) = 20 - w \), and the number of white fish is \( 4 + w \).

According to the problem, after adding the 17 fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So we can write the equation:
\[ 20 - w = 2(4 + w) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 20 - w = 8 + 2w \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2w + w \]
\[ 12 = 3w \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. Let's verify this:
- If Bob bought 4 white fish, he bought \( 17 - 4 = 13 \) orange fish.
- The total number of fish in the pond is \( 7 + 17 = 24 \).
- The number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- The number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Check if the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), which is true.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. He goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip (going to work and coming back) is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance he drives in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so the number of gallons he uses in a week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Andy spends on gas in a week. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week in terms of money. Let's box the final answer.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the total amount of money in quarters as follows:

\[ 140 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, we can calculate the total amount of money in twenties as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ twenties} \times 20 \text{ dollars/twenty} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, we need to calculate 3/5 of $200:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent in quarters and the amount spent in twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

"First, let's find out how cold it gets at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = \text{Day temperature} - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we know that the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The current night temperature is 12 degrees, which is 10 degrees below the freezing point. To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be raised to at least 32 degrees.

The difference between the current night temperature and the freezing point is:

\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = \text{Freezing point} - \text{Current night temperature} \]
\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to find out how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{\text{Temperature increase needed}}{\text{Temperature increase per log}} \]
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = 4 \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is 12. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Initially, the train has 172 people. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more get on. So, the number of people on the train after the first stop is:

\[ 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 + 13 = 151 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is:

\[ 151 - 38 = 113 \]

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 113."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30 day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien gets in a day:**
   - Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.

2. **Determine the value of one bottle cap:**
   - Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

3. **Calculate the total value of the bottle caps Damien gets in a day:**
   - Total value per day = Number of bottle caps per day × Value per bottle cap
   - Total value per day = 10 bottle caps × $0.25/bottle cap
   - Total value per day = $2.50

4. **Calculate the total value of the bottle caps Damien gets in a 30 day month:**
   - Total value in a month = Total value per day × Number of days in the month
   - Total value in a month = $2.50/day × 30 days
   - Total value in a month = $75.00

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30 day month is $75.00."
"First, let's find out Jamie's regular hourly rate. She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. So, her regular hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Regular hourly rate} = \frac{\$20}{8 \text{ hours}} = \$2.50 \text{ per hour} \]

For any additional hours worked, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, her special hourly rate for additional hours is:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 150\% \times \$2.50 = 1.5 \times \$2.50 = \$3.75 \text{ per hour} \]

Last Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. Out of these, 8 hours are regular hours and the remaining 3 hours are additional hours. So, we need to calculate her pay for both the regular and additional hours.

For the 8 regular hours:

\[ \text{Pay for regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$2.50 \text{ per hour} = \$20 \]

For the 3 additional hours:

\[ \text{Pay for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$3.75 \text{ per hour} = 3 \times \$3.75 = \$11.25 \]

Now, we add the pay for the regular hours and the additional hours to find the total pay for the day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$20 + \$11.25 = \$31.25 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{31.25}\) dollars for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together.

First, we know there are 12 female lions.

Next, we need to find the number of male lions. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Then, we know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 \]

Adding these numbers together:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]
\[ 18 + 14 = 32 \]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[ 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's find out how much the jeans are discounted. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are on sale for 25% off.

To find 25% of $40.00, we can calculate:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the jeans are discounted by $10.00. Now, let's find the sale price of the jeans:
\[ \text{Sale price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from $50.00:
\[ \text{Money left over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"

"To find out how long they will be caroling, we need to add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"".

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they plan to sing it twice, so:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they plan to sing it once, so:
240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds

Now, we add the time for both songs:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's starting salary:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - So, his final salary is $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

2. **Billy's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Since Billy works 20 hours a week, his weekly earnings are $11.50 * 20 = $230.
   - If we assume he works 52 weeks a year, his annual earnings are $230 * 52 = $11,960.

Next, we need to determine Sally's starting salary.

3. **Sally's starting salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Sally's hourly wage is $10.50.
   - Her weekly earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.
   - If she works 52 weeks a year, her annual earnings are $210 * 52 = $10,920.

5. **Difference in earnings:**
   - The difference in their annual earnings is $11,960 - $10,920 = $1,040.

So, Billy will earn $1,040 more than Sally in a year. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- So, 3 loaves of bread cost \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- So, 2 bagels cost \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The difference is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 4 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's score, we divide 278 by 2:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Now, we add 11 to this result to find Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's find out how many students and teachers there are in total at Ashley's school.

There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Each class also has an average of 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

To find the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers, we add the two amounts together:

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

To find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has, we add these numbers together:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) stuffed goats will be:

\[ 14 + x \]

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, distribute the 0.30 on the right side:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. If she plays half an hour each day, then in 14 days she plays \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so in 7 days she plays \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she has already played:
\[7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours}\]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}\]

The final numerical answer is:

- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \( 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \).

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars after 2 hours:
- The difference in distance is \( 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"First, let's find out the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, James pays a 30% premium on the total cost. To find out how much the premium is, we calculate 30% of $900:

\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find out the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For the third graders:
- 340 out of 500 passed.
- The pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} \).

For the fourth graders:
- 40 out of 100 passed.
- The pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} \).

For the fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders.
- Since the fourth graders' pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} \), the fifth graders' pass rate is \( 2 \times \frac{40}{100} \).

Now, let's calculate these pass rates.

For the third graders:
\[ \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \]

For the fourth graders:
\[ \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \]

For the fifth graders:
\[ 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \]

Next, we need to find the overall pass rate for the entire school. The total number of students is:
\[ 500 \text{ (third graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The total number of students who passed is:
\[ 340 \text{ (third graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 780 \text{ students} \]

The overall pass rate is:
\[ \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 0.78 \) or 78%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has two bags, and each bag holds 72 chips.

So, the total number of glass chips is:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed per square inch:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total number of square inches by the height of the mosaic:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the total quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon. So, we divide the total quarts by 4 to get the total gallons:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.
2. By the end of the first month, the number of students doubles. So, the number of students becomes \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
3. By the end of the second month, the number of students doubles again. So, the number of students becomes \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
4. By the end of the third month, the number of students doubles again. So, the number of students becomes \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
5. By the end of the fourth month, the number of students doubles again. So, the number of students becomes \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
6. By the end of the fifth month, the number of students doubles again. So, the number of students becomes \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year. 

- At the beginning of the year, there were 10 students.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to understand how much he earns per branch. Since he charges $.25 for each branch he climbs, we can calculate the number of branches he climbed by dividing the total money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Number of branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Number of branches climbed = $105 / $0.25

Now, let's do the division:
105 / 0.25 = 420

So, Felix climbed 420 branches in total. Since he made this money in a week, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week.

Branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Branches climbed per day = 420 / 7

Now, let's do the division:
420 / 7 = 60

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks initially:

1. She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. She picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she initially picks:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower of each type and the wind blows away 1 flower of each type. So, she drops:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ flowers}
\]

Since each dropped flower has a certain number of petals, we need to subtract the petals of these 4 flowers from the total:
\[
1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Now, subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"First, let's find out how many marshmallows John and DeSean used to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and each S'more uses one marshmallow, so John uses 9 marshmallows.
DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows too.

Together, they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

Now, we need to divide these 14 S'mores between John and DeSean.

If they share the S'mores equally, each would get:
14 S'mores ÷ 2 = 7 S'mores.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's determine how long each person can play the game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
His two friends who are worse than him can play for half as long as Jack, so:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
One of his friends who is better than him can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time they play together:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many quarters are used. We know that each quarter allows them to play for 20 minutes. So, we divide the total playtime by 20 minutes per quarter:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Since each quarter costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Tanya uses \( x \) ounces of salt.
2. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses \( 2x \) ounces of oil.
3. She uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, so let's say she uses \( x \) ounces of fragrance and \( x \) ounces of citrus zest.
4. She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses \( x \) ounces of sugar.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients:
- Salt: \( x \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2x \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( x \) ounces
- Citrus zest: \( x \) ounces
- Sugar: \( x \) ounces

The total amount of ingredients is:

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so:
\[ 6x = 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oil she uses, which is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil she uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. To express this as a decimal, it is approximately 3.33 ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the goats. John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows. John buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

So, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[ \boxed{4500} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cupcakes Paul already has in total. He has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. So, we add these numbers together:

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother is:

\[ 16 \]

Let's box the final answer:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. We know the total amount raised is $175,000 and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they raised a total of $125,000. So, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of hours Sandy walked over the two days. This is the sum of the hours she walked on the first day and the second day:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

The problem asks for the total time in minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cars were in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   So, the earnings from one cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, for one day, he does 30 cycles, so his daily earnings are:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days in a week.

   So, his weekly earnings are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00 \text{ per week}
   \]

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars if he works a full 7 day week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Game:**

2. **Second Game:**
   - Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points.

3. **Total Points for Sasha:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.
   - Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.
   - Therefore, Sasha's total points are \(14 + 4 = 18\).

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, we multiply 8 by 11:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Let's find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have.

Smendrick has \( 3P \):
\[ 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

Becca has \( 3P + 12 \):
\[ 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Cindy has of each color.

1. Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35 \text{ per pound} = \$1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08 \text{ per mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these two costs together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Amazon will refund. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Milly will lose. This is the sum of the shipping cost and the difference between the book's purchase price and the refund amount:
\[ \$3.00 + (\$32 - \$24) = \$3.00 + \$8.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. First week production: 8,000 bars
2. Second week production: Half of the first week, so \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. Third week production: Three times the first week, so \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. So, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week.

She records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes per video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends doing her makeup each week. She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup each week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes per day} \times 6 \text{ days per week} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add up the total time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes on TikTok videos} + 120 \text{ minutes on songs} + 90 \text{ minutes on makeup} = 282 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time she spends on TikTok-related activities in a month is:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:

"First, let's break down the cost of the initial installation:

- The initial installation costs $129.00.
- This includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Now, Angela needs additional items:
- 6 mirrors (6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier)
- 20 pictures (20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures)

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

Let's calculate the cost for the additional items:
- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Now, let's add the cost of the additional items to the initial installation cost:
- Initial installation cost: $129.00
- Additional items cost: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost:
- Total cost = Initial installation cost + Additional items cost
- Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

So, the final numerical answer is $324.00."
"First, let's find out how much money Eva has saved. According to the question, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved. The question states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[ 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]

So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The question tells us that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. To find Roy's total savings, we add this amount to Anthony's savings:

\[ 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. So, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert 480 inches into feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 480 by 12:

\[ 480 \div 12 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each part of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"First, let's understand the information given:

- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

We need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance.

Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, then the total speed of the 3 kangaroos combined is the distance divided by 18 hours.
   - Let's denote the distance as \( D \) and the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
   - The total speed of 3 kangaroos is \( 3v \).
   - Therefore, the distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 \text{ hours}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v \text{ (distance)}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of 4 turtles}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway."
"First, let's find out how many dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so:
\[ \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so:
\[ \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
\[ \text{Total dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 140 \]"
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means that the total amount of money she currently has is:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

We know that Erika has already been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom agrees to give her $80. So, the total amount of money she has from these sources is:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money she has (from her purse and the money she has already received) is $350. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the final number of apple slices left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's find out how much milk 3 cows produce in a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows will give:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we need to determine how much more milk is needed and then figure out how many additional cows are required to produce that amount.

The difference in milk production needed is:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is not used and then add those amounts together.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   - If the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, then 1/6 of it is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
     \]
   - So, 2 millimeters of the first glue stick are not used.

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   - 2/3 of it is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
     \]
   - So, 8 millimeters of the second glue stick are not used.

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   - 1/2 of it is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
     \]
   - So, 6 millimeters of the third glue stick are not used.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused glue from all three sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

So, Craig has 19 dollars left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack has 60 dishes, he must have half that number of socks. Therefore, Jack has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 30 socks, Peter has \(30 \times 2 = 60\) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: 60 dishes + 30 socks = 90 items.
- Peter's total: 60 socks + 30 dishes = 90 items.
- Combined total: 90 (Jack's total) + 90 (Peter's total) = 180 items.

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"First, let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know there are 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only. So, the number of students good at both subjects can be calculated by subtracting the number of students good at only math and only English from the total number of students.

Number of students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider that these 7 students are included in the 5 students who are good at math only. So, the total number of students good at math is the sum of those good at math only and those good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the 10-minute intermission to the total time for one group:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many groups can fit into the 2-hour concert. First, convert the 2 hours into minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in 120 minutes, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   Brenda invested $300, so \( P = 300 \).

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, so \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \).

3. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**
   The formula for simple interest is \( I = P \times r \times t \), where \( t \) is the time in years.
   Here, \( I = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \).

   Let's calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   The total amount \( A \) after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest earned.
   \[
   A = P + I = 300 + 202500 = 202800
   \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is \(\boxed{202800}\)."
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars and how many do not.

There are 40 white shirts in total. Half of them have collars, so:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
This means 20 white shirts have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. We already know that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. The difference is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. Since there are 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm after the sales.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y together:

\(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
     \]

2. **Determine the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   - James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
   - To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
     \[
     \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair}
     \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
110
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Each basket of green food costs $25, and you are buying 3 baskets. So, the total cost for the green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. So, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
You are buying 3 baskets of red food, so the total cost for the red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the final total amount you have to pay is:
\[ 123 \]"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). So, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

So, the total number of homes built over the three years is \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of the people as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Then my brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3(S + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Now let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ S + S + S + 3S + 3 + 9 - 2 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6S = 87 - 9 \]
\[ 6S = 78 \]
\[ S = \frac{78}{6} \]
\[ S = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. Let's check the answer by calculating the ages of my brother and sister:
- My brother's age is \( 13 + 3 = 16 \).
- My sister's age is \( 13 - 2 = 11 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3 \times 16 - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \).

Adding all the ages together:
\[ 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87 \]

The sum is correct, so the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy so that each of the 27 students can have 2 glue sticks, and we need to ensure there are some extra glue sticks left over.

First, let's calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- There are 27 students.

\[
27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[
\frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs}
\]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 7 packs of glue sticks.

To ensure there are some extra glue sticks left over, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[
7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks}
\]

Thus, Mr. Jackson will have 56 glue sticks in total, which is 2 extra glue sticks.

So, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water passing through it.

2. **After the Heavy Rain:**
   - On the second day, the amount of water doubles.
   - So, the amount of water on the second day is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - So, the amount of water on the third day is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, we start with 10 infected people. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections on the first day is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

After the first day, the total number of infected people is the initial 10 plus the 60 new infections:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

On the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections on the second day is:
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]

After the second day, the total number of infected people is the 70 from the end of the first day plus the 420 new infections:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

On the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections on the third day is:
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]

After the third day, the total number of infected people is the 490 from the end of the second day plus the 2940 new infections:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]

So, the total number of infected people after three days is:

"First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times 20 \text{ dollars/customer} = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ dollars} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual tips:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} + 720 \text{ dollars} = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the number she originally had:

12 - 9 = 3

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"First, let's understand how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ badges/year} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber takes 2 months to earn 1 badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ badge}}{2 \text{ months}} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 6 \text{ badges/year} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges/year} = 36 \text{ badges/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges/year} - 6 \text{ badges/year} = 30 \text{ badges/year} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total time Paige baked:**
   - Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

So, Paige raised **40 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
2. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), then the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).
3. Since we know the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation: \( S + 30 = 70 \).
4. To find the number of silver coins, we solve the equation:
   \[
   S + 30 = 70
   \]
   Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   S = 70 - 30
   \]
   \[
   S = 40
   \]
   So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.
5. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
   \[
   \text{Total coins} = \text{Gold coins} + \text{Silver coins} = 70 + 40 = 110

"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.

\[
50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
\]

Next, we need to account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos.

\[
500 \text{ burritos given to students} - 20 \text{ burritos eaten by Mr. George} = 480 \text{ burritos}
\]

Now, we know that George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos were leftover, we subtract the number of burritos that were eaten or given out from the total number of burritos ordered.

\[
600 \text{ burritos ordered} - 480 \text{ burritos eaten or given out} = 120 \text{ burritos leftover}

"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. We know there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, we subtract 2 from the number of red cars:

12 red cars - 2 = 10 green cars

Next, we know there are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars. So, we multiply the number of green cars by 3:

10 green cars * 3 = 30 blue cars

Now we know the number of red, green, and blue cars:

- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

To find out how many yellow cars there are, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

75 total cars - (12 red cars + 10 green cars + 30 blue cars) = 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Also, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So Anne has 16 books. Now we can find out how many books Fawn has:

\[ Fawn's \, books = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. There are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, we multiply 30 by 4:

\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. We know that one box makes 10 small jello cups. So, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups one box makes:

\[ \frac{120}{10} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Total Monthly Cost**: The total cost of groceries is $400 per month.

2. **Madeline's Share**: Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. To find out how much Madeline pays, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Keenan's Share**: Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Four-Week Month**: We need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly share by 4:

So, after the first day, he has:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces left}
\]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, after the second day, he has:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left}
\]

Now, on the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.

"First, let's find out the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

For soda:
- 7 bottles cost $21.00
- So, 1 bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

For water:
- 4 bottles cost $8.00
- So, 1 bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03

So, Amy scores 41 points."
"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
\]

Next, we know that Isaias plans to sell each chicken for $50. So, the total money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

\[
\text{Total money from selling} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much money he spent on the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total money he will make:

\[
\text{Money spent on chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

So, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is $7000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
7000
\]"
"First, let's find out how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. So, we can subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold to find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together.

\[ \text{Total glasses sold} = 32 \]
\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} = 14 \]
\[ \text{Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together} = 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them.

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah.

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} = 14 \]
\[ \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = 9 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 14 - 9 = 5 \]

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add them together.

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hairdo cost. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure cost. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we add the costs of all the services together:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hairdo} + \text{Cost of manicure} + \text{Cost of pedicure} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total money from selling the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[ \text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, let's calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope.

\[ \text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$39 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$39 = \$1 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$1 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - So, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for her age being thrice her present age:**
   - Let's say \(x\) years from now, Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.
   - Her current age is 8, so thrice her current age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
   - In \(x\) years, her age will be \(8 + x\).
   - We need to find \(x\) such that \(8 + x = 24\).

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - \(8 + x = 24\)
   - Subtract 8 from both sides: \(x = 24 - 8\)
   - \(x = 16\)

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Kelly has \(\boxed{5}\) dollars left in her budget."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( x \) minutes.
2. For the final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. So, the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes.
3. At the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the length of the concert plus the encore, which is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.
4. We know that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 = 65
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 15 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 65 - 15
   \]
   \[
   2x = 50
   \]
6. Next, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{50}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

- Argo gave 40 toys to Alyssa.
- Argo gave 80 toys to Bonnie.
- Argo gave 30 toys to Nicky.

So, the total number of toys given away is:
40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys

Argo originally had 200 toys. After giving away 150 toys, the number of toys Argo has now is:
200 - 150 = 50 toys

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on those three days, we need to add up the number of chimichangas made each day.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:
\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit in pairs. We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit. So, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. This means the remaining microphones that can fit in pairs are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate 2/3 of 6.
3. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate 3 times 8.

Let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of birds feeding:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we add all the birds together:
\[ 6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds} \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \text{ cookies} \]

She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the number of cookies by the number of jars:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find out how many plants are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find out how many are flowering plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins first. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob, we can find out how fast a whirligig spins. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 55 meters per second."
"First, let's find out how much Ellen pays for the salad and the yogurt each day.

The salad costs $6.

The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so:
\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. So, the cost of the two carrots she eats every day is:
\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:
\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Mark used to make in a day. He worked 8 hours a day and made $10 an hour, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate how much he makes in a week before the pay raise:

\[ \$80/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$400/\text{week} \]

Now, let's find out his new hourly wage after the raise. His old hourly wage was $10 and it was raised by $2:

\[ \$10 + \$2 = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Then, we calculate how much he makes in a day with the new hourly wage:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$96/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate how much he makes in a week with the new hourly wage:

\[ \$96/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$480/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn:**
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn:**
   - Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

3. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn:**
   - She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn.
   - For Kamala's lawn, she earned \( 3x \times 6 \) dollars.
   - For Alba's lawn, she earned \( 5x \times 6 \) dollars.

5. **Sum up the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 6 + 3x \times 6 + 5x \times 6 \)
   - Simplify the expression: \( 6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x \)

6. **Total earnings from all sources:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
   - Therefore, \( 6 + 48x = 80 \).

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 48x = 74 \)
   - Divide both sides by 48: \( x = \frac{74}{48} = \frac{37}{24} \approx 1.54 \)

8. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Substitute \( x = \frac{37}{24} \) back into the total earnings equation:
   - \( 6 + 48 \times \frac{37}{24} = 6 + 2 \times 37 = 6 + 74 = 80 \)

9. **Determine the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Since the total earnings from all sources is $80 and the earnings from mowing lawns is $80, the earnings from lemonade sales must be:
   - \( 80 - 80 = 0 \)

So, Tasha made $0 from lemonade sales.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed by finding 1/5 of 50 miles.

\[ \text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add this additional distance to the distance Dijana rowed to find the total distance Anis rowed.

\[ \text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."

First, we need to find out how much material Jo needs to make one small mask and one large mask.

1. **Material for one small mask:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

2. **Material for one large mask:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

Next, we need to calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

   - Therefore, for 8 large masks:
     \[
     8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together to get the total material required.

5. **Total material needed:**
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
   \]

So, Jo would need **16 yards** of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"First, let's find out the total number of movie tickets Deepa has bought. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27 \text{ tickets}} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Adding these up:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. He has 9 red shoe boxes, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes are left. He started with 7 blue shoe boxes and used 3, so:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, he has 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes are left. He started with 9 red shoe boxes and used 3, so:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
So, he has 6 red shoe boxes left.

Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4 and the number of red shoe boxes left is 6. The final answer is:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes."
"First, we need to find out how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books that Sarah had, and Sarah had 9 books, we can calculate the number of books Joseph had originally as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's original books} = 2 \times \text{Sarah's books} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to account for the 2 books that Joseph lost. So, we subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ \text{Joseph's current books} = \text{Joseph's original books} - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16 \]

So, the final number of books Joseph currently has is 16."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. He gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie.

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Now, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total number of marbles Dean originally had.

\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\).

2. **Set up the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages:**
   - According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let Adam's age four years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(52 = 2x\).

3. **Solve for Adam's age four years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2: \(x = \frac{52}{2} = 26\).
   - So, Adam's age four years ago was 26.

4. **Determine Adam's current age:**
   - Adam's age four years ago was 26.
   - Therefore, Adam's current age is \(26 + 4 = 30\).

5. **Calculate Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam's age will be \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now we know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres and Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. To find the total number of acres for both farms, we add these two numbers together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres."
"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, we multiply 40 by 8:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby completes 320 packages in an eight-hour workday.

Now, we know that he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. To find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he gets paid per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we divide 180 by 30:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in that time. So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many yellow balloons there are based on the information given.

First, we know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. If there are 20 red balloons, then the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, we know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces of bologna} - 40 \text{ pieces of bologna for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces of bologna}}{3 \text{ pieces of bologna per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours on Wednesday.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours on Thursday.

Now, to find out how many hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours he worked each day:

- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

So, the total hours worked is \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons. A dozen means 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 12 balloons, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ balloons}}{2 \text{ balloons per $0.5}} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars} = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. So, the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items. Since they bought everything together, the total amount of money they had combined is $28. Because they split the money equally, we need to divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. We know that there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. We know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer:

\[ 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students.

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.

So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to find out the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$90 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

So, the final numerical answer is 47."
"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices a day} \]

Now, let's find out how many slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day:

\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices a day} \]

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices eaten per day:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha collects shells every month. From the age of 5 to her 10th birthday, she would have been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she collected shells is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months. Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows. So, each row has:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. This means each row has:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups of chamomile tea and } 4.5 \text{ cups of mint tea}
   \]
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. The remaining cups are:
   \[
   27 - (9 \times 2) = 27 - 18 = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
   But we know she uses these 9 cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, which means she uses the remaining 9 cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This part doesn't affect the number of cups of mint tea in each row.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[
\boxed{4.5}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.

This means that in 4 hours, the sloth makes one trip. So, the time for one trip is 4 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
- In 8 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make is:
  \[
  \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
  \]

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we need to find out how many berries he picks up per trip.

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
- Total berries: 24
- Number of trips: 2

So, the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[

"First, let's find out how much water is in the tank. The pool has 10000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount.

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of a movie ticket:**
   - On Fridays and Saturdays, the ticket costs $10.
   - On other days, the ticket costs $7.

2. **Cost of a popcorn and a box of candy:**
   - Popcorn costs $8.
   - A box of candy costs $2.
   - So, the cost for one popcorn and one box of candy is $8 + $2 = $10.

3. **Colby's total money:**
   - Colby has $150 to spend.

4. **Colby's expenses:**
   - He already spent $10 on popcorn and $2 on candy, so he has $150 - $10 - $2 = $138 left.

5. **Colby's previous movie expenses:**
   - He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and each movie costs $10, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies.
   - He saw 8 movies on other days, and each movie costs $7, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies.
   - So, his total previous movie expenses are $50 + $56 = $106.

6. **Remaining money for new movies:**
   - Colby has $138 - $106 = $32 left for new movies.

7. **Number of new movies he can see:**
   - Each new movie costs $10 (since it's a Friday or Saturday).
   - With $32, he can see $32 / $10 = 3 full movies (since he can't see a fraction of a movie).

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

To find the total calories for all the pastries, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

1. On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

\[
\text{Total Junebugs} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the bus} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the car} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance of the bus} - \text{Distance of the car} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Now, let's add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie now has 62 toys in total. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the total number of toys she already has from the total number of toys she has now:

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons Maria gave to her friends. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria also received 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons Maria had initially is:

\[ 2 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Including Maria, there are 5 people in total (4 friends + 1 Maria). So, the total number of water balloons given by her mom is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the initial number of water balloons to the number of water balloons given by her mom:

\[ 2 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 17 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is:

\[ 410 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 410 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. Since it runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Since it also runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling each machine's widgets at $6 per widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total hours Cameron will stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 10 am is 7 hours.
   - Since he stays for 12 hours initially, he will add 7 more hours.
   - Total hours = 12 (initial stay) + 7 (additional hours) = 19 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:**
   - The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
   - Cameron will pay for 19 hours, so the cost would be \( \frac{19}{24} \times 1600 \) pesos.
   - \( \frac{19}{24} \times 1600 = 1300 \) pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost if Cameron adds on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:**
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 7 hours, he pays 70 pesos per hour.
   - Total cost for additional hours = 70 pesos/hour × 7 hours = 490 pesos.
   - Total cost = 1000 pesos (initial stay) + 490 pesos (additional hours) = 1490 pesos.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost for 24 hours - Cost for 19 hours.
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1490 pesos = 110 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 110 pesos by choosing the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we subtract 3 pounds from this amount to find out how much each sheep needs:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. We need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately and then add them together.

For the goats:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

For the sheep:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earns $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas from his earnings. He spends $50 on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, John can buy 4 pens. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled out to the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows for each school, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

1. First, we know there are 8 children in each row.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. There are 5 different schools.

So, we calculate the total number of children as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of children} = (\text{Number of children in each row}) \times (\text{Number of rows per school}) \times (\text{Number of schools}) \]

\[ \text{Total number of children} = 8 \times 7 \times 5 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \]
\[ 56 \times 5 = 280 \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

The final numerical answer is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming the coupons.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:
\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ 842 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 842 \]"
"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to break down the cost into different parts:

1. **Visit Fee**: Patty charges $40 to visit the house.
2. **Labor Cost**: The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we calculate the labor cost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: The parts cost $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75
\]

So, Patty charged **$178.75**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.

\[
10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
\]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays after the 40% discount. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price.

\[
60\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.60 \times \$150 = \$90
\]

So, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. We need to calculate how much money he gets from selling these 5 CDs.

\[
5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money James was out. He paid $90 for the 10 CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. So, we subtract the amount he paid from the amount he got from selling the CDs.

\[
\$200 - \$90 = \$110
\]

Therefore, James was out $110. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams. Jen has 6 yams and each yam can be sold for $1.5. So, the total earnings from the yams are:
\[ 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each sweet potato can be sold for $2. So, the total earnings from the sweet potatoes are:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]

Then, let's calculate the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots and each carrot can be sold for $1.25. So, the total earnings from the carrots are:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we add up all the earnings from the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots to find the total earnings:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

So, Jen will earn a total of $34 if she sells everything. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James goes half the speed he swam at initially.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 3 \text{ hours (resting)} + 8 \text{ hours (swimming remaining)} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"First, let's find out what seven times the number of loaves Sam had is. Sam had 70 loaves, so:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, the bakery has 40 less than this number. So we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is 450."
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to the 8 she had left:

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- So, the commission per New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- So, the commission per Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"
"To find out how old Leo is, let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Also, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. So we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:

\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. Let's check the solution:

- Azibo's points: \( A = 5 \)
- Bahati's points: \( A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \)
- Dinar's points: \( A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 \)

Adding these up: \( 5 + 25 + 15 = 45 \), which matches the total points.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book in inches by the number of pages that fit into one inch of paper.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages in one inch of paper.

So, we calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is 150 pages."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
13 hours = 13 * 60 = 780 minutes

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 780 minutes, we divide 780 by 15:
780 ÷ 15 = 52

So, Vince stapled reports for 52 intervals of 15 minutes each. Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he staples per interval:
52 * 30 = 1560

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1560."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
2. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep on the bed:

- From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
- From 5:55 a.m. to 6 a.m. is 5 minutes.

So, the total time she was asleep on the bed is 7 hours and 55 minutes plus 5 minutes, which is 7 hours and 60 minutes.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, we can simplify this to 8 hours.

Therefore, the number of minutes she slept on her bed that day is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 480 minutes."
"First, let's determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied initially. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

\[ \text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds initially} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

The problem states that one-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. So, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To find out how many people really attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number of people Courtney reported and then subtract that from the number she reported.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly said that this number was 20% too high. So, we need to find 20% of 48.

First, let's calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

This means that the actual number of people is 9.6 less than what Courtney reported. So, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and typically in such contexts, we would round to the nearest whole number, but the problem doesn't specify rounding, so we can leave it as 38.4.

However, if we need to provide a whole number, we can round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

So, the number of people who really attended the concert is 38.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"

1. We know that Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
3. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried \(\frac{2}{2} = 1\) ball.

Now, let's add up the total number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ \text{Total number of balls} = \text{Jordan's balls} + \text{Jason's balls} + \text{Jeffrey's balls} \]
\[ \text{Total number of balls} = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 \text{ (first day)} + 13 \text{ (second day)} + 6 \text{ (third day net increase)} = 29 \text{ holes} \]

According to the problem, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

This means that by the end of the third day, the island had 40 holes. Since we already calculated that there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, we need to find out how many more holes were dug on the fourth day to reach 40 holes:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes} \]

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final numerical answer is:

2. \( S = 4A - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \) (Together they have caught 339 Pokemon)

First, we can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \) into the total equation.

From the second equation, we have:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

From the first equation, we have:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

Now, substituting \( X \) and \( S \) into the total equation:
\[ (4A - 8) + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4A - 8 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Let's denote the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes.

Next, we need to find the number of episodes. The problem states that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. So, if \( E \) is the number of episodes, then:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting \( M = 20 \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes in total.

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = E \times M \]

Substituting \( E = 10 \) and \( M = 20 \):

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each leg of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( 446 \) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   - 1 dozen = 12 brownies.

2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   - 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies.

3. At her friends' surprise party, 4 dozen brownies were waiting for her.
   - 4 dozen = 48 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received:
- Brownies from herself: 12
- Brownies from her office: 6
- Brownies from her friends: 48

Total brownies received:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies that were eaten during the party:
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
- 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 dozen = 18 brownies.

Now, subtract the brownies eaten from the total:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's find out the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we can calculate the brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, let's find out the age of Nani's sister. Since Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = \text{Nani's age} - 0.25 \times \text{Nani's age} = 8 - 0.25 \times 8 = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"First, let's calculate the total time Andy will spend on each type of racquet:

1. For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut:
\[ 3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

2. For the 5 racquets with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

3. For the 4 racquets with the hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add up all the minutes to find the total time:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all of those racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of people getting phones:**
   - John, his 2 kids, and his wife make a total of 4 people.

2. **Determine the price of each phone:**
   - The first 2 phones cost $600 each.
   - Each phone after the first 2 is half price, so the third and fourth phones cost $600 / 2 = $300 each.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of the first phone: $600
   - Cost of the second phone: $600
   - Cost of the third phone: $300
   - Cost of the fourth phone: $300

4. **Add up the costs:**
   - Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for the phones."
"First, we need to find out how many players Zeke's team has. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players in Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players in Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 33."
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence he is building. The fence is rectangular, so we can find the total length by adding the lengths of all four sides. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find the total number of wood slats needed:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we know she originally had 12 boxes. After giving away 4 boxes, she had:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

So, she kept 3 boxes. The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 5 \times 20 = 100 \text{ oranges} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of states in the USA:**
   - The USA has 50 states.

2. **Calculate half the number of states in the USA:**
   - Half of 50 states is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) states.

3. **Determine the number of states in India:**
   - India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
   - So, India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.

4. **Calculate the total number of states in both countries:**
   - USA has 50 states.
   - India has 29 states.
   - Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79 states.

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. We add the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook:

\[
18 + 13 + 8 = 39
\]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to find out how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. We subtract the amount of money he has already saved from the total cost:

\[
39 - 14 = 25
\]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books.

Now, we need to determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[
25 \div 5 = 5
\]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to earn the additional $25 he needs.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more than Richard. So, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now we know Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries. The total number of cherries is 60. So, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now we know Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6.
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Each box of apple pie costs $15.
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

**Total earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is $465."
"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use in one day.

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much sunscreen she will use over 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen she will need to pack. Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we divide the total ounces she will use by the number of ounces in one bottle:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's find out how much the red car costs. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, it means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price (100% - 40% = 60%).

The price of the blue car is $100. So, the price of the red car is 60% of $100.

To find 60% of $100, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 years old.
3. At that time, his dad will be twice Emil's age, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be half his dad's age, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old, which confirms our previous calculation.
5. Emil's brother will be half of Emil's age at that time, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Emil's dad and brother are now. Since Emil will be 24 when he turns 19, that means 5 years have passed since he was 19. So, his dad will be 48 - 5 = 43 years old now, and his brother will be 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

To find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now, we add their ages together:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. So, her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. So, her friend gave her \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, to find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend:

\[ 20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]
\[ 50 + 40 = 90 \]

So, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads. 

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"First, let's find out how much crawfish Joe caught on Friday. He caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, and he caught 3 pounds on Thursday.

So, on Friday, he caught \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) pounds of crawfish.

Next, let's find out how much he caught on Saturday. He caught half the amount he caught on Friday.

So, on Saturday, he caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pounds of crawfish.

Now, let's add up all the crawfish he caught from Thursday to Saturday.

Total crawfish caught = Crawfish from Thursday + Crawfish from Friday + Crawfish from Saturday
Total crawfish caught = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many servings of crawfish he has. Each serving is 3 pounds.

So, the number of servings is \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) servings.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. We know that 20% of the 30 students are football players.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students.

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, 24 students are not football players.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players to the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band to find out how many students are leaving early.

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is 12."
"First, let's find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie wears size 25 boots.

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's size} + \text{Sophie's size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 12 inches = 12 / 12 = 1 foot

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long.

Each flower grows to be 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to add more plants to fill the flower bed. To find out how many more plants she needs, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between plants:
111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she needs 45 more plants to fill the flower bed (because 44 plants would only fill 44 * 2.5 = 110 feet, leaving 1 foot empty, and she needs the whole flower bed filled).

Now, we calculate the total cost. Pat needs 45 more plants, and each plant costs $6:
45 plants * $6/plant = $270

So, Pat will spend $270 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Edgar's pretzels per day} \]

Given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket first and then multiply it by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- Petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- Sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

Total cost for one basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Now, since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
- Total cost for 5 baskets = $14.00 * 5 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = \frac{25}{100} \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for fancy shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has for shoes in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we divide the total amount she has for shoes by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel in a minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to saute 30 shrimp. According to the information, she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 

Now, we need to find out how long it will take her to saute 90 shrimp. Since sauteing 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes, sauteing 90 shrimp will take:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: Let's assume the starting temperature of the room is 100 degrees.

2. **Air Conditioner on Low for 3 Hours**:
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it will cool the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.
   - So, after 3 hours, the room temperature will be \(100 - 6 = 94\) degrees.

3. **Air Conditioner on High for 4 Hours**:
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, it will cool the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.
   - So, after 4 hours, the room temperature will be \(94 - 12 = 82\) degrees.

4. **Air Conditioner Off for 2 Hours**:
   - The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the room will warm up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.
   - So, after 2 hours, the room temperature will be \(82 + 4 = 86\) degrees.

5. **Final Temperature**:
   - The final temperature of the room is 86 degrees.

6. **Degrees Lower Than Starting Temperature**:
   - The starting temperature was 100 degrees.
   - The final temperature is 86 degrees.
   - So, the room is \(100 - 86 = 14\) degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw it. So, Bill saw the comet when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old. This means that Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. So, Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which means 4 times per year).

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks he writes each year:

- For the electric bill: 12 checks (once per month)
- For the gas bill: 12 checks (once per month)
- For the church: 24 checks (twice per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks)
- For the pest and lawn service: 4 checks (quarterly, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks)

Now, let's add them all up:

12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The first plane makes 44 trips in total (since 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes).
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece, France, and Germany:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of trips to Greece is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
     \]
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
     \[
     88 - 66 = 22
     \]
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is:
     \[
     \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]

So, the first plane takes 66 flights to Greece and 11 flights to France in one day.

The final numerical answer is:
66"
"First, let's determine how long each wolf howls.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, Chikote's howl is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. So, Igneous's howl is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Now, let's find the total length of time all three wolves howl combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the total seconds by 60:
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father together:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the total cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Age of the Group**: We know the total age of the four children is 20 years.

2. **Akbar's Age**: Akbar is 3 years old.

3. **Alessandro's Age**: Alessandro is 4 years old.

4. **Helene's Age**: Let's denote Helene's age by \( H \).

5. **Wilfred's Age**: Let's denote Wilfred's age by \( W \).

6. **Average Age of the Group**: The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. So, the average age is:
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

7. **Helene's Age**: According to the problem, Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age \( H \) is:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

8. **Total Age of the Group**: We know the total age of the group is 20 years. So, we can write the equation for the total age as:
   \[
   3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
   \]

9. **Solve for Wilfred's Age**: Now, we need to find Wilfred's age \( W \). We can do this by substituting the known ages into the equation:
   \[
   3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   17 + W = 20
   \]
   Subtract 17 from both sides to solve for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 20 - 17 = 3
   \]

So, Wilfred's age is \( 3 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's friend will contribute. The friend is going to give Walter $200.

So, the total amount Walter has now is: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we need to calculate how much Walter's lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else has contributed a total of $2200, the lawyer will donate:

$2200 * 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's find out the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Distribution:**
   - There are 2 adults and 4 kids.
   - Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

2. **Total Slices:**
   - Let's assume the watermelon is divided into 6 slices (since there are 6 people).
   - If each kid gets 1 slice, then each adult gets 2 slices.

3. **Total Slices for Each Group:**
   - Each adult gets 2 slices.
   - Each kid gets 1 slice.
   - Total slices for adults = 2 slices/adult * 2 adults = 4 slices.
   - Total slices for kids = 1 slice/kid * 4 kids = 4 slices.
   - Total slices = 4 slices (adults) + 4 slices (kids) = 8 slices.

4. **Percentage Calculation for Each Adult:**
   - Each adult gets 2 slices out of a total of 8 slices.
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula: \(\frac{\text{Number of slices for each adult}}{\text{Total number of slices}} \times 100\).
   - So, the percentage for each adult = \(\frac{2}{8} \times 100 = 25\%\).

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients.

He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.
So, the total time for inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the total time for inpatient rounds from minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his appointments.

He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.
So, the total time for appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the total time for appointments from minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. So, the time left for him to update his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's add up all the time it takes to make and prepare the cake:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:

20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the total time needed to complete the cake.

Now, we need to find out what time it would be 180 minutes before 5:00 pm.

180 minutes is 3 hours (since 180 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours).

So, if we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to add the total number of chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold and then divide by the number of boxes they sold.

First, let's add the number of boxes they sold:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

So, the total number of boxes they sold together is:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the cost per session and then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:
- Cost to rent the studio: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10

Cost per session = Cost to rent the studio + (Cost per student per session * Number of students)
Cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10)
Cost per session = $25 + $15
Cost per session = $40

Now, let's find out the number of sessions in a month. The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

Number of sessions in a month = Number of days the studio is rented per week * Number of weeks in a month
Number of sessions in a month = 3 * 4
Number of sessions in a month = 12

Finally, we calculate the total earnings for the month:
Total earnings = Cost per session * Number of sessions in a month
Total earnings = $40 * 12
Total earnings = $480

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Peter has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Martha has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

Number of months in a year = 12

Number of babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to add the number of babies born in a year to the original population:

Total number of porcupines after a year = Original population + Number of babies born in a year

Let's calculate this.
```python

"To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of gallons by $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.2 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. We know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. We know that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, let's calculate how far Matteo traveled. Matteo traveled at a speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Matteo:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at a speed of 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students over 16 years old is:

     \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students over 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     1500 - 375 = 1125
     \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{1500}{2} = 750
     \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students under 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     1500 - 750 = 750

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - So, Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - So, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day: \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - So, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - So, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day: \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled in Two Days:**
   - Total water filled in two days: \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - So, the remaining water needed to fill the tank: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

1. **Initial Condition**: Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. **First 5 Hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 1 hour, the charge is 91% (100% - 9%). After 2 hours, the charge is 82% (91% - 9%). After 3 hours, the charge is 73% (82% - 9%). After 4 hours, the charge is 64% (73% - 9%). After 5 hours, the charge is 55% (64% - 9%).

3. **Next 3 Hours**: After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its charge each hour. So, after 6 hours, the charge is 48% (55% - 7%). After 7 hours, the charge is 41% (48% - 7%). After 8 hours, the charge is 34% (41% - 7%).

4. **Final Condition**: After 8 hours, the charge remaining is 34%. But we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. This means that the charge after 8 hours was 34% and it decreased to 28% over the next few hours. This implies that the charge decreased by 6% over the next few hours, but since we are only asked for the initial charge, we can conclude that the charge after 8 hours was indeed 34%.

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 34%.

The final numerical answer is:
34%"
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} + 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save to buy the car. The car costs $10000, and she wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 10000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks she needs to work is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.5 (peaches) + $2.0 (pears) + $2.0 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After buying the fruits he has already purchased, he has:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's find out the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. So, we need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends. She originally had 15 packs, and she kept 2 packs, so she gave away:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs were given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase year by year.

The initial price of carrots is $120.

After the first year, the price increases by 5% of $120. To find 5% of $120, we calculate:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 0.05 \times 120 = 6 \]
So, the price after the first year is:
\[ 120 + 6 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price again increases by 5% of the new price, which is $126. To find 5% of $126, we calculate:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 126 = \frac{5}{100} \times 126 = 0.05 \times 126 = 6.3 \]
So, the price after the second year is:
\[ 126 + 6.3 = 132.3 \]

After the third year, the price increases by 5% of the new price, which is $132.3. To find 5% of $132.3, we calculate:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 132.3 = \frac{5}{100} \times 132.3 = 0.05 \times 132.3 = 6.615 \]
So, the price after the third year is:
\[ 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915 \]

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then determine how many of those were selfies and how many were portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and she put them into 8 albums. So, we can find out how many pictures are in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album has 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we can find out how many selfies and portraits there are by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

For selfies:
\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \]

For portraits:
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

45"
"First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to find the time it takes to read one page.

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages. We can multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18 pages.

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. Let's confirm this with a final answer.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early. So, the number of guests left is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late. So, the number of guests left is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in. The number of guests now is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in. So, the number of guests now is:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked on each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"First, let's find out how many easy questions there are in the quiz. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of easy questions} = 40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many questions are average and how many are difficult. Since the easy questions make up 40% of the total, the remaining 60% are divided equally between average and difficult questions. So, the number of average and difficult questions combined is:

\[ \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60\% \times 60 = 0.60 \times 60 = 36 \]

Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions is:

\[ \text{Number of average questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

And the number of difficult questions is also:

\[ \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get is:

\[ \text{Easy questions Aries is sure to get} = 75\% \times 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get is:

\[ \text{Average and difficult questions Aries is sure to get} = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

\[ \text{Total sure points} = 18 \text{ (easy)} + 18 \text{ (average)} + 18 \text{ (difficult)} = 54 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price of a small stuffed animal:**
   Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

2. **Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**
   Large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones.
   \[
   \text{Price of a large stuffed animal} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Let's define variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from large stuffed animals:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings from large stuffed animals} = 12x
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings from small stuffed animals:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings from small stuffed animals} = 4 \times 2x = 8x
   \]

6. **Total earnings from both types of stuffed animals:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 12x + 8x = 20x
   \]

7. **Given that the total earnings are $120:**
   \[
   20x = 120
   \]

8. **Solve for \( x \):**

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 77."
"First, let's calculate the total money Suzanne earned from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. So, she gave away:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes would mine \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds of ore in a month.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, given that the prices are proportional.

First, let's look at the given information:
- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.

We can see that the second package has twice as many sandwiches as the first package, and it costs twice as much as the first package. This suggests that the price is proportional to the number of sandwiches.

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

Since the price is proportional, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}}
\]

We can use the first part of the proportion to find \( x \):
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{x}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
2x = 3 \times 8
\]
\[
2x = 24
\]
\[
x = \frac{24}{2}
\]
\[
x = 12

"First, let's find out how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. So, he uses $1000 from the sale to pay part of the bedroom set.

$3000 (cost of new set) - $1000 (money from old set) = $2000 (remaining cost of new set)

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 per month.

To find 10% of $2000, we calculate:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

"First, let's calculate how many red balloons burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons and 40% of them burst. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons left is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She started with 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Half of } 12 = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons left is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider all the possible scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will not collect the homework.
   - This means there's a 50% chance that the normal teacher will collect the homework.

2. **Normal Teacher:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
   - This means there's a 60% chance that the normal teacher will not give an extension.

3. **Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
   - This means there's an 80% chance that Marcus will not get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 50%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50%

- **Normal Teacher:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework (extension given): 40%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework (no extension given): 60%

- **No Extension Given:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework (extension given): 40%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework (no extension given): 60%

- **No Personal Extension:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework (extension given): 40%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework (no extension given and no personal extension): 60% * 80% = 48%

Now, we combine the probabilities:

- **Substitute Teacher:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 50%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50%

- **Normal Teacher:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 40% + 50% = 90%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 10%

Now, we combine the probabilities for the overall scenario:

- **Substitute Teacher:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 50%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50%

- **Normal Teacher:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 90%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 10%

To find the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ \text{Overall probability} = (50\% \times 50\%) + (90\% \times 10\%) \]

\[ \text{Overall probability} = (0.50 \times 0.50) + (0.90 \times 0.10) \]

\[ \text{Overall probability} = 0.25 + 0.09 \]

\[ \text{Overall probability} = 0.34 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.34 \times 100 = 34\% \]

"First, let's find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats for graduates = 950 seats
Seats for faculty = 300 seats

So, the number of seats left for graduates and their guests is:
\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are \( G \) graduates. Each graduate would get:
\[ \frac{4750}{G} \text{ seats} \]

However, the question doesn't specify the number of graduates, so we can't calculate the exact number of seats each graduate gets without that information. But if we assume the question is asking for the number of seats each graduate would get if the number of graduates is known, we can express it as:
\[ \frac{4750}{G} \]

Since the question doesn't provide the number of graduates, we can't give a specific numerical answer. But if we assume the question is asking for the formula or the process, the answer would be:
\[ \frac{4750}{G} \]

If we assume the number of graduates is a specific number, say 1000 for example, then:
\[ \frac{4750}{1000} = 4.75 \]

So, each graduate would get 4.75 seats. But without the specific number of graduates, the final numerical answer cannot be provided."

"First, let's calculate the total time Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total pay for the 3 days. She is paid $15 per day, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking. She pays $3 for parking each day, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total pay:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total pay after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway and then calculate the total time it will take him to place the candy in each bottle.

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.
   - To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time to place the candy in each bottle:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and place the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, and so on, until bottle 7 to bottle 8).
   - Therefore, the total time is:
     \[
     7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}

\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = 3 \times 6 = \$18
\]

Now, let's add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$22 + \$18 = \$40
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount.

\[
\text{Money left} = \$50 - \$40 = \$10
\]

So, the final amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
- He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
- Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job.
- His college degree triples his income, so after college, his income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed during his college years:

- He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college and stayed in his job:

- He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:

- He would have earned $75,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income during college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had stayed in his job for 4 years:

- Total income if he stayed in his job = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had gone to college:

- Total income if he went to college = Total income during college + Total income without college
- Total income if he went to college = $300,000 + $100,000 = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:

- Total income if he had not gone to college = Total income without college
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $100,000.

Finally, let's calculate the difference in income:

- Difference in income = Total income if he went to college - Total income if he had not gone to college
- Difference in income = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric Jim needs to buy. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. Calculate the length of the fabric:
   - Original length of the bed: 6 feet
   - Additional length: 2 feet
   - Total length of the fabric: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet

2. Calculate the width of the fabric:
   - Original width of the bed: 8 feet
   - Additional width: 2 feet
   - Total width of the fabric: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

3. Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
   - Length: 8 feet
   - Width: 10 feet
   - Area: \(8 \times 10 = 80\) square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

4. Calculate the total area of fabric needed:
   - Area of one piece: 80 square feet
   - Total area for two pieces: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

The final numerical answer is:
160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday's Letters:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Letters:**
   - On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - So, Tuesday's letters are \( 85 + 17 = 102 \).

3. **Wednesday's Letters:**
   - On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's letters is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - So, Wednesday's letters are \( 204 + 5 = 209 \).

4. **Total Letters Delivered:**
   - To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters from each day.
   - Total letters = Monday's letters + Tuesday's letters + Wednesday's letters
   - Total letters = 425 + 102 + 209

Now, let's add these numbers:
\[ 425 + 102 = 527 \]
\[ 527 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want the chicken salad and each person costs $6.50.

\[ \text{Cost of chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad and each person costs $6.

\[ \text{Cost of pasta salad} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 65 + 36 = 101 \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   So, Johnny's dad lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.17 \]"
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Here's the calculation:

- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people in each city = 1000

Total number of people = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city

Let's do the multiplication:

26 × 5 × 1000

First, multiply 26 by 5:

26 × 5 = 130

Now, multiply the result by 1000:

130 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"First, let's determine how many days the painters worked in total. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days they worked is:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days they worked in 3/8ths of a day. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total number of days by 3/8:

\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} \text{ days} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to convert the total work time from days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total number of days by 24:

\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours} = \frac{1512}{8} \text{ hours} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

This is the total work time for all 4 painters. To find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:

\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 47.25 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car's price depreciates by 21% each year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
- The price in 2007 is $20000.
- In 2008, the price will be 79% of $20000.
- So, the price in 2008 = $20000 * 0.79 = $15800.

Now, let's calculate the price of the car in 2009:
- The price in 2008 is $15800.
- In 2009, the price will be 79% of $15800.
- So, the price in 2009 = $15800 * 0.79 = $12442.

Finally, let's calculate the price of the car in 2010:
- The price in 2009 is $12442.
- In 2010, the price will be 79% of $12442.
- So, the price in 2010 = $12442 * 0.79 = $9752.38.

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9752.38."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we need to find out how many books are written in German. We know that 10% of the books are in German. To find 10% of 50, we calculate:

\[
\frac{10}{100} \times 50 = 5
\]

So, there are 5 German books.

Now, to find out how many books are written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
20

"First, let's find out how many kilometers Bernice has already driven. She drove for 4 days and a total of 325 kilometers.

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive. We do this by subtracting the kilometers she has already driven from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers.

So, we calculate:
\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, let's find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
- Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
- In 30 days, she drinks \( 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \).

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. So, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to get the number of gallons:
- \( 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \).

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people get off the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\), get on the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The final number of people on the train is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"First, let's break down the costs of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: The original price was $8, but with a $2 off coupon, the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Tank top: $10
Running shorts: $15
Tennis shoes: $24
Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you first need to know the area of each tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is:

\[ \text{Area of each tile} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} = 1\, \text{ft} \times 1\, \text{ft} = 1\, \text{SqFt} \]

Now, to find out how many tiles you need to cover the entire kitchen floor, you divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the kitchen floor}}{\text{Area of each tile}} = \frac{200\, \text{SqFt}}{1\, \text{SqFt}} = 200 \]

Each tile costs $12, so to find the total cost, you multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = 2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."

\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = \$72 \]

So, the increased cost is:

\[ \$120 + \$72 = \$192 \]

This is the cost per month after the accident. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[ \$192 \times 12 = \$2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2304 \]"
"First, let's understand how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week. He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Each twin bed needs 1 set of sheets, and the king size bed needs 1 set of sheets. So, in total, he needs to wash:

\[ 4 \text{ (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ (king bed)} = 5 \text{ sets of sheets per week} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry he needs to do each week. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. Since he needs to wash 5 sets of sheets per week, we can see that he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in one load. This means he needs to do:

\[ 1 \text{ load per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many loads he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ 1 \text{ load per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ loads per year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to first calculate how much cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Imma has 3 cats and feeds them 60 grams of cat food each time. Since she feeds them twice a day, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount consumed per day:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from the number of slices Becky ate:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying the number of slices Jake ate by 2:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Now, we know the number of slices each person ate:
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Silvia ate 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices together:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's call the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can say Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can find the time for Betsy's part by adding 18 to 40:

\[ Betsy's\ part = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"First, let's break down the costs mentioned in the question:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit is only 30 minutes, we need to convert this to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 582
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $582."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to in a day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails a day. This means he needs to respond to the rest of the emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails a day. Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320 emails."

1. Add up all the scores John got on his tests.
2. Divide the total score by the number of tests.

First, let's add up all the scores:
- John scored 100 on his first 3 tests.
- John scored 80 on his 4th test.

So, the total score is:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we need to divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many as the glee club, so:

\[ \text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left by the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So we calculate:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate is:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. So the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

The final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had problems. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser. We can find the number of trucks that successfully delivered by subtracting the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks:

\[
\text{Number of trucks that successfully delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons per truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, we need to consider the promotion at the grocery store. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound. 

To find out how much it will cost Dennis to buy 6 pounds of butter with this promotion, we can think of it in terms of how many sets of 2 pounds he can get:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis only pays for 1 pound. So, for 3 sets, he will pay:
\[ 3 \text{ sets} \times 1 \text{ pound per set} = 3 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 3 pounds of butter is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited to the party:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Next, we need to find out how many people will actually come to the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of people who will come is:

- Total invited - People who could not come = 45 - 4 = 41 people.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of renting the theater. The base fee is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. Since 41 people are coming, the number of additional guests is:

- Additional guests = Total guests - Initial guests = 41 - 20 = 21 people.

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost of the party:

- Total cost = Base fee + Additional cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the total cost of the party will be $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it.
   - A quarter of $60 is calculated as \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \).
   - So, Maggie spent $15 and has \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars left.

2. Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it.
   - One-third of $60 is calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \).
   - So, Riza spent $20 and has \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars left.

3. Now, we need to find out how much money they have left together.
   - Maggie has $45 left and Riza has $40 left.
   - So, together they have \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars left.

The final numerical answer is 85."
"First, let's find out how many bananas all the monkeys eat together in a week. Mr. Robles has 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

Each monkey eats 10 bananas a day. So, the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \( x \).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ 10 + 14 + x = 24 + x \]

Since the bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 3 \times (24 + x) = 315 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3 \times (24 + x) = 315 \]
\[ 24 + x = \frac{315}{3} \]
\[ 24 + x = 105 \]
\[ x = 105 - 24 \]
\[ x = 81 \]

So, the third monkey eats 81 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 81 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first puzzle, which has 500 pieces. So, he placed:

Teddy then finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, he placed:
\[ 500 \text{ pieces} \]

In total, Teddy placed:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so:
\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5 \text{ per bill} = \$25 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Jenny has left after buying the roses. The cost of the roses is $30, and she has $25:
\[ \$25 - \$30 = -\$5 \]

Since the cost of the roses ($30) is more than the money Jenny has ($25), she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot leave with any change.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so we multiply:

\[ 6 \times 5.50 = 33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling burger platters. He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so we multiply:

\[ 9 \times 11 = 99.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so we multiply:

\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30.00 \]

Now, we add up all the money he makes from each item to find the total amount of money he makes:

\[ 33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:

\[ \boxed{162.00} \]"
"Let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves after 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves after 60 minutes, so it arrives in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives.
   - Arrives at 65 minutes and leaves at 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 65 minutes and arrives at 65 minutes, so it leaves at 65 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after 65 minutes, so it arrives at 65 + 20 = 85 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul will wait for his train. He needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes.

Since Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait for 85 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:
85 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Now, we know that the blueprint requires 200 toothpicks and Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks. So, she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Find the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
   - To find 75% of $2000, we calculate:
     \[
     0.75 \times 2000 = 1500
     \]
   - So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500.

2. **Find the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   - To find 120% of $1500, we calculate:
     \[
     1.20 \times 1500 = 1800
     \]
   - So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch for $1800.

3. **Calculate the discount percentage for Mr. Rogers' friend:**
   - The friend bought the watch for $1800, which is 120% of the original price.
   - To find the original price, we need to determine what 100% of the original price is.
   - If $1800 is 120%, then 100% of the original price is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{1.20} = 1500
     \]
   - The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.
   - The discount amount is:
     \[
     2000 - 1800 = 200
     \]
   - The percentage discount is:
     \[
     \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%
     \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many jellyfish are created by one spring in 4 hours, and then multiply that by the number of springs.

1. First, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since one spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
   \[
   14400 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be:
   \[
   5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 72000 jellyfish."

- Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

To find Frankie's score, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate twice Binkie's score: \(2 \times 90 = 180\).
2. Add 15 to the result from step 1: \(180 + 15 = 195\).

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final numerical answer is:
195"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James walks halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway would be:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. James walks this 2 miles to the halfway point. Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it takes to walk 2 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. After reaching the halfway point, James has to walk back home. The distance back is also 2 miles. So, the time it takes to walk back is the same as the time it took to walk to the halfway point:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. The total time James spent walking is the sum of the time to the halfway point and the time back home:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost if she bought the bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of the fence.
2. Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of the fence.
3. Together, they have 100 feet of fence.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

4. Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

5. Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

6. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to calculate the total amount of fence and subtract what Sam gets:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the crocodile grows per year and then use that rate to find out how much it grows in 13 years.

First, we know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how much it grows in one year, we divide 8 inches by 4 years:

\[ \text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches per year, we can find out how much it grows in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings from all types of bikes.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

- Total bikes sold = 300
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
- The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)
- Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 225 = 10125 \) (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, which is $500, so BMX bikes are $250 each)
- Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

\[ 67500 + 10125 + 52500 = 129125 \]

So, Marcel earned $129,125 from selling bicycles during that month.

The final numerical answer is:
129125"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many bales of hay the farmer makes and how many the truck picks up in a 6-hour day, and then find the difference.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[ 12 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's find out how many periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, he has:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods per day} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time John spends in class each day is:

\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes per day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes per week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the extra learning time per week is:

\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Now, we need to find the total time John spends learning in a week, which is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time:

\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28.33 \text{ hours per week} \]"
"First, let's find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce.

The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony. Each story is 24 feet high, so the height of the third-floor balcony is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When the ball bounces, it reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, after the first bounce, the height the ball reaches is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce. The ball will again bounce to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, which is 48 feet. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is 32 feet."
"First, let's convert all heights to inches to make the calculations easier. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. The orchard sells each bag for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1000 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

3. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

4. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

6. Multiply both sides by 4 to get \( x = 270 \times 4 \).

7. Calculate \( 270 \times 4 = 1080 \).

So, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add up the total area of all the walls:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
\[240 \div 20 = 12\] gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

So, the final cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

- There are 2 shaken sodas left.
- There are 8 unshaken sodas left.

The total number of sodas left is \(2 + 8 = 10\).

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we convert the fraction to a percentage:

\[
\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 = 20\%
\]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(20\%\).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
   - The first train travels \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
   - The second train travels \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each train has traveled.
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

So, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.

So, the total number of days is:
31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50 days:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, Billy works on:
50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he can help in one day is:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, the final numerical answer is:
240"
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses:

\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars:

\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is 480."
"First, let's find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age:

\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for people to slide down each waterslide and then find the difference in time.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest waterslide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's find out how much time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch time: 30 minutes
- Break time: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time for lunch and breaks together:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (break) = 60 minutes

Bobby spends 60 minutes on his lunch and breaks each day.

Next, we need to find out how much time he spends on these activities over 5 days:
60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
300 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the miles Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Miles Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Miles Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

So, the charge after the return is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
   Discount amount = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Cost of frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
   Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Cost of set of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on her credit card:

Remaining balance after return: $70.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of set of towels: $27.00

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, let's add this to the remaining balance on her credit card:

New balance on credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( x \).

2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

3. A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

4. According to the problem, when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{15} = 6
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"First, let's find out how old Ben is. Since Ben is two times older than Chris and Chris is 4 years old, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year. Her current salary is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times 100,000 = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

2. **Determine how much Lauren will live on each year:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 40\% \times 100,000 = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the net savings Lauren will have each year:**
   Net savings is the amount saved minus the amount spent on living expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net savings} = 20,000 - 40,000 = -20,000
   \]
   Since the net savings are negative, Lauren is not saving enough to cover her living expenses. She will actually be spending more than she saves each year.

4. **Determine how many years Lauren can save before she runs out of money:**
   Since Lauren is not saving enough to cover her living expenses, she cannot save for 20 years as planned. She will need to stop saving before she runs out of money.

Since Lauren cannot save for 20 years due to her living expenses exceeding her savings, the number of years she needs to work is 0.

   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}

"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's call the total number of students in the school ""T"".

If 40% of the total students is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Now, to find out how many girls are in the school, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Soledad needs to hike each day to cover 9,300 miles in June, given that she plans to hike twice a day.

First, let's find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike twice a day, so the total number of hikes she plans to do in June is:
\[ 2 \text{ hikes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hikes} \]

If she covers 125 miles each time she hikes, the total distance she plans to cover is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 60 \text{ hikes} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

She wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she plans to hike is:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"First, let's find out how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left.

\[ \text{Money left} = \text{Budget} - \text{Money spent} \]
\[ \text{Money left} = 16 - 2 = 14 \]

So, Anna has $14 left after her purchases.

She spent $4 on the books and other things. Now, let's find out how much she spent on the books.

\[ \text{Money spent on books} = \text{Money left} - \text{Money spent on other things} \]
\[ \text{Money spent on books} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both cost the same amount. To find the cost of each book, we divide the total cost of the books by 2.

\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Total cost of books}}{\text{Number of books}} \]

"First, let's determine how long each person took to do their chores.

1. Amalia mowed the lawn and it took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. So, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did laundry and it took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume Dior took 12 hours for her laundry (since it's well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:
- Amalia's time: 4 hours
- Megan's time: 6 hours
- Dior's time: 12 hours

Adding these times together:
\[ 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents.

First, let's determine the distance John drives for a one-way trip. We know that he drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for a one-way trip:
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes two round trips each month. A round trip means driving to his parents and back, so the round trip distance is:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance John drives each month is:
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. So, in 7 days, she will walk:
   \[
   10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let the distance Brian walks in 7 days be \( B \), then:
   \[
   70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B
   \]

3. To find \( B \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}

"First, let's calculate how many toys the first 4 workers can produce in an hour.

Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 = 12 \text{ toys/hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 = 8 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Now, let's add the production rates of all four workers:
\[ 12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many toys all four workers can produce in a 10-hour shift:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the 10-hour shift, they have produced 200 toys. They still need:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker needs to produce the remaining 200 toys in the 10-hour shift. So, the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Seth originally had \( S \) stickers.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
4. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. So, the remaining stickers Kris received were \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 \).
5. Kris gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \).

Now, we need to solve for \( S \):

\[
\frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
S = 64

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's. So, for 30 ounces, the number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it takes Alfie to fly that distance.

First, let's find half of the circumference of the earth:
\[ \text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance Alfie flies each day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour.

So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we need to multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

The speed of the faster car is:
\[ 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age.
   - Let \( V \) be Vince's age two years ago.
   - According to the problem, \( 14 = 2V \).

3. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find \( V \):
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

4. **Determine Vince's current age:**
   - Since two years have passed since then, Vince's current age is:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say they each painted \(x\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's say Sarah painted \(y\) eggs, so Camden painted \(y + 12\) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + x + y + (y + 12) = 56
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2x + 2y + 12 = 56
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 2y = 44
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   x + y = 22
   \]
4. We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
   \[
   y + (y + 12) = 30
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2y + 12 = 30
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2y = 18
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   y = 9
   \]
5. Now we can find \(x\) using \(x + y = 22\):
   \[
   x + 9 = 22
   \]
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 13
   \]
6. So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs, and Sarah painted 9 eggs. Camden painted \(y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.
7. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:
   \[
   21 - 13 = 8
   \]

The final answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. We do this by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need. Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, he will need 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to find the total weight:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find out how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Next, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, we calculate the total amount he makes:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Valerie's Salary**: Valerie earns $5000 per month.

2. **Brother's Salary**: Valerie earns half of what her brother earns. So, if Valerie earns $5000, her brother earns twice that amount.
   \[
   \text{Brother's Salary} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000
   \]

3. **Mother's Salary**: Their mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
   \[
   \text{Combined Salary} = \text{Valerie's Salary} + \text{Brother's Salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000
   \]
   Now, their mother earns twice this combined salary.
   \[
   \text{Mother's Salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000
   \]

4. **Total Salary**: To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = \text{Valerie's Salary} + \text{Brother's Salary} + \text{Mother's Salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000
   \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3-mile trail. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach.

First, let's find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach:

\[ \text{Time to walk 1 mile on the beach} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time it takes her to walk the entire 3-mile trail by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save.

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 every week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount still needed by the amount she saves each week.

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 7 blue birds each. There are 3 such trees, so:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 4 blue birds each. There are 2 such trees, so:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds, so:

\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds from each tree:

\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is 26.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is at 33 degrees. The other mug is at an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( x \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the 33-degree mug now has \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees of water left.

Donny also pours 1 ounce of water from the other mug into his water bottle. This means the other mug now has \( x - 1 \) degrees of water left.

After pouring, Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. So, the temperature of the water in his water bottle after pouring must be at least 40 degrees.

The temperature of the water in his water bottle is the sum of the temperatures of the water he poured from both mugs. So, we have:

\[ 29 + (x - 1) \geq 40 \]

Simplify the left side of the inequality:

\[ 29 + x - 1 \geq 40 \]
\[ 28 + x \geq 40 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x \geq 40 - 28 \]
\[ x \geq 12 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 12 degrees to allow Donny to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of cows and chickens added to the farm over three weeks.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. In three weeks (which is 21 days), the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In three weeks (which is 21 days), the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks.

The total number of cows after three weeks is:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

The total number of chickens after three weeks is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we add the total number of cows and chickens:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Russell gets a 10% discount for ordering 4 packs, we need to calculate the discount amount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \text{ dollar} \]"
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. The number of scoops is 1 less than 3, which is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The question also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops will require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days by adding the eggs from both periods:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. We know there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans. Since there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jelly beans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = \text{Total number of jelly beans} - \text{Number of green jelly beans} - \text{Number of red jelly beans} \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - 17 - 34 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many men and women are initially on the bus and then determine how many women remain after 20 women alight.

First, let's understand the ratio given: the ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Since the ratio parts add up to 14, we can find out how many passengers each part represents by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:

\[ \text{Number of passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find out how many men and women are initially on the bus by multiplying the number of parts for men and women by the number of passengers per part.

- Number of men initially: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women initially: \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

Next, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. Initially, there are 54 women on the bus. After 20 women alight, the number of women remaining is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers in one day. So, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold in one day by dividing the total earnings by the price of one sunflower:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold in one day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price of one sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets of sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. We know that each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets in one day. So, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold in one day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the price of one bouquet:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold in one day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. So, the total number of sunflowers sold in one day is the number of bouquets sold multiplied by the number of sunflowers in each bouquet:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in one day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold in one day} \times \text{Number of sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Now, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of sunflowers sold in one day by 3:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold in one day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

Next, Adam sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we calculate 60% of 20 rocks.

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue Adam gets from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue from selling rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adam initially had $100. After selling the rocks, he has the remaining money.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 100 - (20 \times 5) + 84 = 100 - 100 + 84 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much money Adam loses, we compare his remaining money to the initial amount.

\[
\text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Adam loses $16.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the picture scenes for the project. We can do this by calculating the number of days needed for each type of picture scene and then summing them up.

First, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days needed for large-sized picture scenes = \(\frac{45}{5} = 9\) days.

Next, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days needed for medium-sized picture scenes = \(\frac{36}{6} = 6\) days.

Finally, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days needed for small-sized picture scenes = \(\frac{49}{7} = 7\) days.

Now, we sum up the days needed for all the picture scenes:
- Total number of days = 9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.

So, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is 22 days."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be written as \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), we multiply the probabilities of each event happening.
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100.
   - So, \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"First, let's find out how many seashells each person collected.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from the number of seashells Jim collected:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we know the number of seashells each person collected:
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

To find out how many seashells they gathered in total, we add the seashells collected by each person:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 22 + 27 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person got \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 19 \frac{2}{3} \]"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for weekdays and the total for weekends separately, and then add them together.

For weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend.
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays and the total number of carrots eaten on the weekend:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is:
\[ 30 \text{ carrots} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to find out the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = \frac{60}{100} \times 5 = 0.6 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time of the cassette is:
\[ 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Linus sells each mobile device for. He sells it for twice the original price, which is $20. So, the selling price is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the buying price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since each device gives a profit of $20, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. We know Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, we subtract 2 feet from Isabel's height to find Ned's height:

\[ 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we add 1 foot to Ned's height to find Carl's height:

\[ 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we need to find half of Carl's height to determine the length of his cane:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce compared to what it currently produces.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

Therefore, for 2300 people, we need:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we know that Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

Number of babies dressed in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]

Number of babies dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the babies wear bows. According to the problem, all the babies dressed in blue also wear bows, and 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows.

Number of babies wearing bows:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue-wearers)} + \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ (purple-wearers)} = 2 + 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. We know that 4 babies are wearing bows, and 2 of them are wearing purple.

The percentage chance is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \times 100 = \frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50\% \]"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 1907 \]

Next, let's add the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 2136 \]

Now, we add these two totals together:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

The total number of reports received last week was 5168. To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in total. He owns 80 square meters of unused land.

1. He sold half of the land for $50:
   \[
   \text{Half of the land} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he earned $50 from selling 40 square meters.

2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30:
   \[
   \text{1/4 of the land} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he earned $30 from selling 20 square meters.

3. Now, let's find out how much land is left to be sold:
   \[
   \text{Remaining land} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from remaining land} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Now, let's add up all the earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $140 after selling all his unused land.

"First, let's find out how many eggs Cole hid in total. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs is:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments are in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add that to 400:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

So, the third complex has:

\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from 3 complexes, and each complex has 3 collections per week:

\[ 3 \text{ complexes} \times 3 \text{ collections per complex} = 9 \text{ collections per week} \]

Each collection involves garbage from 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments. So, the total number of apartments he collects garbage from in a week is:

\[ 9 \text{ collections} \times 1040 \text{ apartments per collection} = 9360 \text{ apartments} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 9360 \text{ apartments} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per apartment} = 3744 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, so \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, so \(50 \times 7 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, so \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"First, let's find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we can divide $100 by 5.

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we need to add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had.

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially.

Ronnie was given $5.
Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

Next, let's assume that each of them gave the same amount of money to their little sister, say \(x\).

After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]

Let's solve for \(x\):
\[\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12\]
So, we have:
\[15 - x = 12\]
\[x = 15 - 12 = 3\]

Now, we know that each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie didn't give any money to his sister, he still has all the money he was given initially.

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[5\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used**: The mural used 12 pints of paint in all.

2. **Determine the distribution of paint colors**:
   - The mural has four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
   - There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
   - Half the mural is yellow.

3. **Assign variables to the amounts of paint**:
   - Let \( R \) be the amount of red paint.
   - Let \( W \) be the amount of white paint.
   - Let \( P \) be the amount of purple paint.
   - Let \( Y \) be the amount of yellow paint.

4. **Set up the equations based on the given information**:
   - Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we have:
     \[
     R = W = P
     \]
   - Half the mural is yellow, so:
     \[
     Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
     \]
   - The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
     \[
     R + W + P + Y = 12
     \]

5. **Substitute the known values into the equation**:
   - Since \( R = W = P \) and \( Y = 6 \):
     \[
     R + R + R + 6 = 12
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3R + 6 = 12
     \]

6. **Solve for \( R \)**:
   - Subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     3R = 6
     \]
   - Divide by 3:
     \[
     R = 2

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. So, for one bedroom:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} \]

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down day by day:

- On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
- On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so that's \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs of clouds she counted from Monday to Friday:

\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\]

Let's add these step by step:

"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 

The regular box has 100 pods. 

To find 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special box has:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special box costs $12, and we want to know how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

To find out how many pods we can get with $1, we need to divide the cost of the special box by the cost per pod:
\[ \frac{12}{1} = 12 \text{ pods} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with 12 pods if we use 1 pod per cycle:

"First, let's find out how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially has. He withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling the number of bills means tripling the total amount of money. So, he now has:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount of money by 5:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. So, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before he has to recycle it, given that he has already used 45% of it by the end of Monday.

First, let's find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk, he has 100% - 45% = 55% of the chalk left.

Now, we need to find out how much chalk he uses each day if he only uses 20% of the chalk. We can calculate the remaining chalk as a fraction of the original chalk and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining 55% at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's denote the original length of the chalk as 5 inches. After Monday, the teacher has 55% of the chalk left. We need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 55% of the chalk if he uses 20% of the chalk each day.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining chalk} = \text{Original chalk} \times \text{Percentage left} \]
\[ \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up 2.75 inches of chalk if he uses 20% of the chalk each day. Since he uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can calculate the number of days as follows:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Remaining chalk}}{\text{Chalk used per day}} = \frac{2.75}{0.20} = 13.75 \]

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 14 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4

"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. We know that the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, we can calculate the number of teeth he caps as follows:

Number of teeth capped = Number of teeth drilled + 7
Number of teeth capped = 4 + 7
Number of teeth capped = 11

Now, we know the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth. So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is:

Total teeth fixed = Number of teeth drilled + Number of teeth capped
Total teeth fixed = 4 + 11
Total teeth fixed = 15

To find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Total teeth fixed}}{\text{Total teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = 0.5 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, let's find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus originally bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000 \]

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk because it had passed the expiry date. So, we need to find out how much milk he returned:

\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \]

Let's calculate the amount of milk returned:

\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the milk was returned, Mr. Marcellus got a refund for the cost of 1600 gallons at $3.5 per gallon:

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Wendy's current age is \( W \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - Colin's age in seven years will be \( C + 7 \).
   - So, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times Colin's age in seven years: \( W = 5(C + 7) \).

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
   - Wendy's current age \( W \) is three times Colin's age in 25 years: \( W = 3(C + 25) \).

Now we have two expressions for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 3(C + 25) \]

We can set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 5(C + 7) = 3(C + 25) \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ 5C + 35 = 3C + 75 \]
\[ 5C - 3C = 75 - 35 \]
\[ 2C = 40 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000.

To do this, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27,000. 

Now, to find out how many books he can buy in total, we multiply the number of sets by the number of books in each set:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob can buy 5400 books in total. Since he is distributing this amount between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. 

The final numerical answer is:
1800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Apple**: One apple fell on Newton's head. Newton picked it up and put it in his pocket. So, he has 1 apple in his pocket.

2. **Second Apple**: One more apple fell out of the tree. Newton picked up this apple and threw the first one he picked up (the one he put in his pocket) at the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. So, he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 more apples on the ground. He picks up these 5 apples and puts them in his pocket. Now he has 6 apples in his pocket.

3. **Third Apple**: Another apple fell out of the tree. Newton picked up this apple and threw the one he put in his pocket (the 5th apple) at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. So, he now has 6 apples in his pocket and 6 more apples on the ground. He picks up these 6 apples and puts them in his pocket. Now he has 12 apples in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 12.

"First, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Now that we know Ali needs 17 bags of coal, we can calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's calculate how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend eats:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend eats:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. To find out how many whole cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by the number of slices per cheese pizza:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas and she needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles from Tuesday and Thursday:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[ 19 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.
   - Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
   - Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is \(20 - 2 = 18\) snowballs.

2. **Calculate how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs:**
   - Jay makes 18 snowballs per hour.
   - To find out how many hours it takes to make 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 18.
   - \(60 \div 18 = 3.3333...\) hours.

3. **Convert the decimal part of the hours into minutes:**
   - The decimal part is 0.3333 hours.
   - Since 0.3333 hours is approximately 20 minutes (because \(0.3333 \times 60 \approx 20\)), we can say it will take 3 hours and 20 minutes.

So, it will take Jay 3 hours and 20 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is 3 hours and 20 minutes."
"If John is 28 years old now, and when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age.

Let's say Jim's age when Digimon came out was \( x \). According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim at that time, so John's age at that time was \( 2x \).

Since John is now 28 years old, the difference in their ages remains the same. So, if we subtract Jim's age when Digimon came out from John's current age, we get the difference in their ages:

\[ 28 - x = 2x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 28 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{28}{3} \]
\[ x = 9.33 \]

Since ages are typically given as whole numbers, we can round \( x \) to the nearest whole number, which is 9. So, Jim was 9 years old when Digimon came out.

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the number of years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age when Digimon came out. Since the problem doesn't specify how many years have passed, we assume it's the same number of years as the difference in their ages at that time:

\[ \text{Jim's current age} = 9 + 9 = 18 \]

So, Jim is 18 years old now."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate together:

Doxa: 1 slice
Sister: 2 slices
Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had 50 bandages at the start of the second day.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had 22 bandages at the start of the third day.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages.

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, we calculated 97 bandages. This discrepancy suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to recheck the conditions. But based on the given conditions and the calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:

10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. So the total cost is:

$60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100

The final numerical answer is $100."
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly rate and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.
- Her daily earnings are $11.25.

So, her weekly earnings are:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not miss any days in April, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we add her total earnings from her hourly rate to her total attendance bonus:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

So, Jen will receive:

   - So, his earnings from laundry = $3.00.

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   - Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room.
   - He cleaned his room once.
   - So, his earnings from cleaning his room = $1.50.

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   - Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week.
   - He took the trash out twice.
   - So, his earnings from taking the trash out = $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   - Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.
   - He emptied the dishwasher 6 times.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} + 8 = 40 \]

First, let's denote the number of coffee mugs by \( x \). So the equation becomes:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). We start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had.

Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets, each with six colors:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of 6 colors is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from the makeup set, which means she loses 3 colors:
\[ 22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's two-story house is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is. Since this floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 40\% \times 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total to find out how many shells are left.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 60\% \times 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can first add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk and then subtract that total from the average total miles per day.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The average total miles per day for all four dogs is 3 miles per day.

Since Bernie has 4 dogs, the total average miles for all four dogs is:
3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the total average miles:
12 miles (total average) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

The final numerical answer is 4 miles."
"First, let's find out how much loan John gets. His house is worth $250,000 and he gets a loan worth 40% of that.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times \frac{60}{100} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after paying off his debts. We subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

2. Multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Deandre will earn by selling these 128 kilograms of tuna at $0.50 per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we need to calculate 11/8 of $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

So, Trinity sold each magazine for $99.

Next, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed each day for each setting and then sum them up.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:
- Total water removed = Water removed on low setting + Water removed on medium setting + Water removed on high setting
- Total water removed = 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, let's find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends initially had. They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons each. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose.

Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the amount of the second medicine is:
\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's find out the capacity of Ali's class. We know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find out the capacity of John's classes. We know that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, we need to find the total capacity of both of John's classes:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. The total amount he will pay in 11 months is:
\[ \text{Total payment in 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the total amount paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he needs to return:
\[ \text{Amount to be paid in the twelfth month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 31 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of diaper changes per day for Jordan's two children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for two children, the total number of diaper changes is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

This means the other half of the diaper changes are made by Jordan. Therefore, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's find the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base that is 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the jar) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

So, the volume of the jar is:

\[ V = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar. We know that each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, but the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency. This means that only 80% of the space is used by the jelly beans. So, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we can find out how many jelly beans fit into this effective volume:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim estimates that 30% of these jelly beans are red. So, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. So, the difference between the estimated number and the true number is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off in his guess. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of people who entered the bus at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **Number of people who entered the bus at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people who entered at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **Number of people who entered the bus at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people on the bus before the third stop: 90 people.
   - Number of people who entered at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people who need to be removed to fill the remaining spaces is:
\[270 - 200 = 70\]

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 70.

The final numerical answer is:
\[70\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit to the museum is $2.

2. **Increase in Cost:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. 
   - To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2 and add it to the original cost.
   - 150% of $2 is \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \).
   - So, the new cost is \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Number of Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - In 5 years, she visits \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) times.

4. **Total Cost for the First 5 Years:**
   - The total cost for the first 5 years is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.

5. **Number of Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years.
   - In 3 years, she visits \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) times.

6. **Total Cost for the Next 3 Years:**
   - The total cost for the next 3 years is \( 9 \times 5 = 45 \) dollars.

7. **Total Cost for All Visits:**
   - The total cost for all visits is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = \( 30 + 45 = 75 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \( 75 \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many groups of students can try the escape room and then calculate the total time it will take for all these groups to try the escape room.

1. First, we need to find out how many groups of students can try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each grade and there are 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 6th), the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]
2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. So, the number of groups needed is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 3.75 \text{ groups}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which means we need 4 groups to accommodate all 30 students.

3. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, for 4 groups, the total time will be:
   \[
   4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 180 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John made 4 wooden tables and each table costs $20. So, the total cost for the tables is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames and each frame costs $10. So, the total cost for the frames is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the frames to find out the total amount Ali has to pay:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

So, the final amount Ali has to pay John is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we multiply 8 by 4:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs and then calculate how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning he will need.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, to find out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]

Now that we know he needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning he will need. Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed as follows:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. There are five windows, each 35 inches wide. So, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining minutes (36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.2 per minute.
   - Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts to get the total cost of the 36-minute call.
- Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"First, let's figure out the total number of treats needed. Since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Let's say Carly made \( c \) cupcakes. According to the problem, she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she made is:
\[ 3c - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's check the answer:
- Number of cupcakes: 3
- Number of brownies: \( 3 \times 3 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \)
- Total treats: \( 3 + 7 = 10 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional costs:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional costs:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price for both services:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art costs $3:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the services:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay a total of $90.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets 66 issues every year. Since each issue is from a different magazine, the total number of magazines she gets every year is the same as the number of issues, which is 66.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we let the number of paintings Shelley has be \( S \), then:
   \[
   S = 27 + 12
   \]
   \[
   S = 39
   \]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. If we let the number of paintings Kim has be \( K \), then:
   \[
   S = K + 8
   \]
   Since we already found that \( S = 39 \), we can substitute this value in:
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]
   To find \( K \), we subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   K = 39 - 8
   \]
   \[
   K = 31
   \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

The original price of the toy in November was $40.

An 80% increase means the price increased by 80/100 * $40 = $32.

So, the price in December would be $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50/100 * $72 = $36.

So, the price in January would be $72 - $36 = $36.

The final numerical answer is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we need to calculate the reduced fee for a lesson given to a veteran. The fee is reduced by 25%, so the veteran's fee is 75% of the standard fee. 

To find 75% of $80, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Reduced Fee} = \text{Standard Fee} \times \left(1 - \text{Reduction Percentage}\right) \]
\[ \text{Reduced Fee} = 80 \times \left(1 - 0.25\right) \]
\[ \text{Reduced Fee} = 80 \times 0.75 \]
\[ \text{Reduced Fee} = 60 \]

So, the reduced fee for a veteran lesson is $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day.

For the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \]

For the 2 lessons at the reduced rate:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up all the scores.
2. Count the number of scores.
3. Divide the total sum by the number of scores.

Let's start by adding up all the scores:

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60

First, let's add the scores in pairs to make it easier:

(50 + 100) + (80 + 80) + (60 + 60) + (90 + 70) + 40

This simplifies to:

150 + 160 + 120 + 160 + 40

Now, let's add these together:

150 + 160 = 310
310 + 120 = 430
430 + 160 = 590
590 + 40 = 630

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of scores to find the mean:

\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{\text{Number of Scores}} = \frac{630}{9} = 70
\]

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left now, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he has left after eating:

\[
60 - 24 = 36
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he has left after giving some to his sister:

\[
36 - 9 = 27
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
2. This number (9) is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels is 3 quarters of \( x \). This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by isolating \( x \). To do that, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

So, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:
\[ x = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this, we need to find out how far Michael has traveled in 3 days and then calculate what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this represents.

First, let's find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in 72 hours at a speed of 50 km/hr:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this 3600 km represents. The formula to find the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes her brother used as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. We add the grapes Madeline ate to the grapes her brother used:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, we can calculate the total number of grapes used for the pies:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

So, the number of teachers at school that day = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's do the calculation:

82 - 13 = 69
69 + 9 = 78

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's find out how much Bud spends on cheese each time he makes macaroni and cheese.

He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount on gruyere cheese. So, the amount he spends on gruyere cheese is:
\[ 2 \times 3.00 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese to find out the total cost for one batch of macaroni and cheese:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he makes it 52 times in a year. To find out how much he spends in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 520.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time the custodian needs to clean all the classrooms.

There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. So, the total time needed is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. We need to find out what percentage of their 8-hour workday is spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage seems unrealistic because it exceeds 100%. Let's recheck the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.

The total time needed is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours. The percentage calculation should be:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

It seems the calculation is correct, but the interpretation of the result is not practical. The custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, which means they are working more than one full day in the given 8-hour workday. 

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that can be held by one bookcase:

- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, one bookcase can hold \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens would be:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the eggs. Rose bought them for $2.40 per dozen, and she bought five dozens, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs, the number of sets of 3 eggs is:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set is sold for $1, the total selling price is:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many hats are white:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's find out the regular price of the bag of beef jerky. The regular price is $18.00.

Since there's a $3.00 discount, the price Archie will pay is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

So, Archie will pay $15.00 for the bag of beef jerky.

The bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total price by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we know that $1.00 is equal to 100 cents. Therefore:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to reach the 70% required for moving on to 7th grade.

First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Questions right on the first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach 70% of the total questions. The second test has 40 questions.

Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test as \( x \).

The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of these 110 questions right:
\[ \text{Total questions needed right} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ x = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes is \( S \).
2. The number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).
3. The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, combine like terms:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S - 4 + 4 = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{120}{6} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now we need to find the number of blueberry cubes. We use the expression \( 5S - 4 \):
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 \]
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 96 \]"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many games Ara has played in total over the four years. Since she has been playing 40 games every year, we multiply 40 by 4:
   \[
   40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many points she has scored in total. Since she scores 21 points in each game, we multiply 21 by 160:
   \[
   21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points}
   \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he actually had 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (because even if he doesn't get a customer, he still needs to make the calls).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them to carry. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room. Since there are 8 rooms, the number of flashlights for the rooms is:

\[ 2 \text{ flashlights/room} \times 8 \text{ rooms} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Adding the flashlights for the people and the rooms together, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ flashlights} + 16 \text{ flashlights} = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of these rooms have small candles and the other half have medium candles. So, there are 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

The number of small candles is:

\[ 4 \text{ small candles/room} \times 4 \text{ rooms} = 16 \text{ small candles} \]

The number of medium candles is:

\[ 5 \text{ medium candles/room} \times 4 \text{ rooms} = 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

Adding the small and medium candles together, we get:

\[ 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together to find the total number of candles and flashlights used:

\[ 20 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 56 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's find out how many chips Mitchell has in total. He bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag:

\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 55 \text{ chips per bag} = 110 \text{ chips} \]

Now, Mitchell's family has five members, and they want to share the chips equally. To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \text{ chips} \div 5 \text{ family members} = 22 \text{ chips per person} \]

So, each person gets 22 chips. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 22 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First side**: It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.
   - Time for the first side = 5 minutes

2. **Second and third sides**: Each of these sides takes twice as long as the first side.
   - Time for the second side = 2 * 5 minutes = 10 minutes
   - Time for the third side = 2 * 5 minutes = 10 minutes

3. **Fourth and fifth sides**: Each of these sides takes half as long as the first side.
   - Time for the fourth side = 0.5 * 5 minutes = 2.5 minutes
   - Time for the fifth side = 0.5 * 5 minutes = 2.5 minutes

Now, let's add up all the times:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that there are 20 helmets.
2. Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. So, if there are 20 helmets, then the number of robots is:

"First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim spends dealing with calls in one day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, we can calculate the number of calls he can handle in one day by dividing the total minutes he spends on calls by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5 day work week. We can do this by multiplying the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of days in the work week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the drying time for the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the drying time for the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying time between the new and old varnishes:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts and add up the amounts of water needed for each group of plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water needed per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water needed: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water needed per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water needed: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**

- Water needed for 1 cup plants: 8 cups
- Water needed for quarter cup plants: 2 cups

Total water needed: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance Phineas hops and the distance he swims.

1. **Distance on land**: Half of the total distance is on land. The total distance is 200 yards, so the distance on land is:
   \[
   \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

2. **Distance in water**: The other half of the distance is in water. So, the distance in water is also:
   \[
   \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the main phone costs $20.
2. Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone. So, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. So, there are 5 - 1 = 4 additional phones.
4. The cost of the 4 additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
5. The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the 4 additional phones. So, the total cost is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60.

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for one week first and then multiply it by 5.

Here's how we can break it down:

- Alicia has 5 blouses, and they cost $5.00 each.
- She has 2 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $8.00.
- She has 1 skirt, and it costs $6.00.

First, let's calculate the cost for one week:

1. Cost for blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
2. Cost for pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair} = \$16.00\)
3. Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost for one week:

\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

This is the cost for one week. To find the cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that amount is:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts and 1 quart is equal to 4 cups, 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. Therefore, 4 gallons of lemonade will be:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 64 \text{ cups} \]

Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade. So, for 64 cups of lemonade, he will need:

\[ 64 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many lemons are required to get 64 cups of lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, to get 64 cups of juice, Tim will need:

\[ 64 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 384 \text{ lemons} \]

Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means Tim needs to make an additional 16 cups of lemon juice (since 1 gallon is 16 cups). For this extra lemonade, he will still need 6 lemons per cup, so for 16 cups:

\[ 16 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 96 \text{ lemons} \]

Adding the lemons needed for the extra lemonade to the lemons needed for the 4 gallons, we get:

\[ 384 \text{ lemons} + 96 \text{ lemons} = 480 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

- Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day. Since there are 3 German Shepherds, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
  \[
  3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg}
  \]

- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day. Since there are 2 Bulldogs, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg}
  \]

Now, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
\[
15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much dog food is needed for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together to get the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40 pairs."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
- Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

From the information, we know:
- Number of blue blocks = 4
- Number of yellow blocks = 2 * Number of blue blocks = 2 * 4 = 8

Now, we can write the equation for the total number of blocks:
\[ \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} = 32 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west.

He was driving at an average speed of 18 mph for 5 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he traveled west is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east.

He was driving at the same average speed of 18 mph for 8 hours. So, the distance he traveled east is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's determine how far Elvis is from his house. Since he traveled west first and then east, we need to consider the net distance traveled. The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west:

\[ \text{Net Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} \]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[ \text{Net Distance} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year = $6300.
   - It depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value at the start of the second year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year = $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value at the start of the third year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"First, let's find out how many orange candies there are. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies:

\[ \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108 \]

Next, let's find out how many yellow candies there are. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies:

\[ \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - (\text{Number of red candies} + \text{Number of orange candies} + \text{Number of yellow candies}) \]

\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27) \]

\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 \]

\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 43 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. We know it costs $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that each bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = 0.1 \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, we know that Helen rode the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus trips is:

\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can add those 4 marbles back to find out how many he had originally:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

So, Dallas originally had 25 marbles.

Mazie started with 52 marbles. If Dallas ended up with 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas had from the total number of marbles Mazie had:

\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:

"First, let's find the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 1600 = \frac{1}{100} \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 years to Mia's age:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can calculate the average of their ages. The average is found by adding their ages together and then dividing by 2:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

So, the average of their ages is 48."
"First, let's find out how many seashells they found in total. Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. So, we add these numbers together:

\[ 214 + 432 + 86 \]

Let's do the addition step by step:

1. Add 214 and 432:
\[ 214 + 432 = 646 \]

2. Now add the result to 86:
\[ 646 + 86 = 732 \]

So, they found a total of 732 seashells.

Next, they discovered that 67 of these seashells were cracked. To find out how many good seashells they have, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:

\[ 732 - 67 \]

Let's do the subtraction:

1. Subtract 67 from 732:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

So, the number of good seashells they found together is 665.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Avery needs 3 pieces per place setting: a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.
2. She's having 12 people over, so she needs 12 place settings.
3. Each place setting costs:
   - Dinner plate: $6.00
   - Salad plate: $4.00
   - Bowl: $5.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for one place setting:
- Dinner plate + Salad plate + Bowl = $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

Since she needs 12 place settings, we multiply the cost of one place setting by 12:
- $15.00 × 12 = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption for all pigs is:

Next, we need to find out how much money the company will receive for selling 70000 bars at $2 per bar. The total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we can think of it as two T-shirts at full price and one at half price.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 50% = $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the shoes are now 60% of their original price.

The discounted price of the shoes is $40 * 60% = $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he gets $6 for each week he completes his chores, we can calculate his total allowance as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \text{ dollars} \div 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole tickets, we take the integer part of the division result. Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent. Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, we add these amounts together:

\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

So, Ellen spent $105.

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, we add these amounts together:

\[ 30 + (100 \times 2) = 30 + 200 = 230 \]

So, Lani spent $230.

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add the amounts Ellen and Lani spent:

\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount they spent is $335."
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

1. Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
   \]

2. Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
   \[
   1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
   \]

3. Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of ingredients for one jar:
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Next, we calculate the profit for one jar. The selling price of one jar is $50.
\[
\text{Profit per jar} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Cost of ingredients}
\]
\[
\text{Profit per jar} = \$50 - \$44 = \$6
\]

Finally, to find the profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
\[
\text{Total profit for 10 jars} = 10 \times \$6 = \$60
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them all together.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add the values of all the coins together:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"First, let's add up all the expenses Janet has:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the $40:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works on:

- Monday
- Tuesday
- Thursday
- Friday
- Saturday

That's 5 days a week.

Next, we need to find out how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we know Josh gets paid $4 per car. So, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since we need to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine how many cookies Randy had initially:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, let's add up all the cookies he has now:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's determine how many toy soldiers are in each half of Matthew's collection. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of his collection would be:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, he has 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $5 each, and 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $7 each.

Now, let's calculate the total money he would earn from selling the 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he would earn from selling the other 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:

\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total money he would earn:

\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 72 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. We know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.

Norman High School enrolls 4000 students. So, we calculate the number of students at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
\]

To find \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \), we can break it down:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = \frac{3 \times 4000}{4} = \frac{12000}{4} = 3000
\]

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average each year.

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

So, we do the following calculation:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, let's do the subtraction:

7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is 2325."
"First, let's determine how many test tubes and Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes} \]

Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than the number requested. So, Igor gathered:
\[ 14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes} \]

Next, we know that Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. So, the total number of items Igor gathered is:
\[ 8 \text{ test tubes} + 16 \text{ Petri dishes} + 7 \text{ beakers} = 31 \text{ items} \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost some items. The number of items he lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \text{ items} \]

Since Igor gathered 7 beakers and placed 29 items on the lab bench, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[ 7 - \frac{29 - 2}{3} = 7 - \frac{27}{3} = 7 - 9 = -2 \]

But since the number of beakers lost cannot be negative, we need to recheck the calculation. The correct way to find the lost beakers is:
\[ 7 - (29 - 29) = 7 - 2 = 5 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine how many eggs are in the second basket. We know that the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which has 10 eggs.

So, the number of eggs in the second basket is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's money} = \text{Alexandra's money} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Maryam raised $300. So, we can find out how much Sarah raised by subtracting $400 from $300:
\[ \text{Sarah's money} = \text{Maryam's money} - 400 = 300 - 400 = -100 \]

It seems there is an inconsistency here because Sarah cannot raise a negative amount of money. Let's recheck the problem statement and the given numbers. The problem states that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Maryam raises $300. This means Sarah must have raised $300 - $400 = -$100, which is not possible in real life. However, for the sake of the problem, we will use the given numbers.

Now, let's sum up the money raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total money raised} = \text{Alexandra's money} + \text{Kim's money} + \text{Sarah's money} = 430 + 750 + (-100) = 1080 \]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ \boxed{1080} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's say Aaron's speed is \( x \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute.

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We know Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute, we can calculate the time it took her to run 4 miles.
   - Time taken by Vanessa = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{4}{\frac{x}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{x} = \frac{8}{x} \) minutes.

3. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Since Aaron's speed is \( x \) miles per minute, the distance he ran is \( x \times 16 \) miles.

4. **Relate the distances:**
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - So, \( 4 \) miles (Vanessa's distance) = \( 2 \times (x \times 16) \) miles (Aaron's distance).
   - Simplifying, \( 4 = 32x \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute.

5. **Calculate Vanessa's time:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.
   - Time taken by Vanessa = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \) minutes.

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
64"
"First, let's calculate how much line the caretaker needs for the docks. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more line he needs to buy. He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract this from the total amount of line he needs:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line needed} - 6 \text{ feet of line he already has} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes in one night.

They get 6 reservations a night.
For each reservation, they order 2 meals and a bottle of wine.
Each meal costs $5, so 2 meals cost $5 * 2 = $10.
The bottle of wine costs $5.

So, the total cost for one reservation is $10 (for the meals) + $5 (for the wine) = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night is $15 * 6 = $90.

Now, they are open 2 days a week, so we need to find out how much they make in a week.

The total weekly income is $90 (cost for one night) * 2 (days they are open) = $180.

So, the final numerical answer is $180."
"First, let's find out the total selling price of the 50 watermelons.

The vendor bought the watermelons for $80 and sold them at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and add it to the original cost.

25% of $80 is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Original Cost} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
4. James is 18 years old now, and he is 19 years older than his father John. So, John is 18 - 19 = -1 years old, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's correct this: John is 19 - 18 = 1 year old now.
5. John was 19 when James was born, so John is 19 - 18 = 1 year older than James.
6. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, John is 32 - 19 = 13 years older than his youngest son.
7. Since John is 1 year old now, his youngest son is 1 - 13 = -12 years old, which again doesn't make sense. Let's correct this: John's youngest son is 1 - 13 = -12 + 13 = 1 year younger than John, so he is 1 - 13 = -12 + 13 = 1 year old now.
8. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 1 + 3 = 4 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then compare the number of oranges they peel.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane after one hour:
- Ana has peeled 20 oranges.
- Jane has peeled 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. He gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs $80 after the discount.

Next, let's calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours.

\[ \text{Mechanic's cost} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this problem, let's use a simple algebraic approach.

Let's say:
- \( c \) is the number of chickens.
- \( h \) is the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + h = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. So, we can write the equation for the total number of legs:
\[ 2c + 4h = 70 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To find \( h \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( h = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's find out the total number of slices of pizza. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices by multiplying 7 by 8.

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

So, there are 56 slices of pizza in total.

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. This means the slices will be shared among 4 people (Henry + 3 friends).

To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
