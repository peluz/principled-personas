"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet's ducks lay per day. According to the problem, the ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet eats for breakfast. She eats 3 eggs per day. So, the number of eggs left after breakfast is:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Janet also bakes muffins with 4 eggs per day. Therefore, the number of eggs left after baking muffins is:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These 9 eggs are the ones Janet sells at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required for the robe. Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take:

\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts required:

\[ \text{Total bolts} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after Josh's repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs added $50,000 to the house, so the total cost before the increase in value was:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The house's value increased by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 150\% \times 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh sold the house for $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price plus repairs) from the selling price:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for all sprints:**
   James runs 180 meters in one week for one sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens. Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. This is for 20 chickens:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 300 \text{ cups} \]

In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. This is also for 20 chickens:
\[ 25 \text{ cups} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 500 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we add the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 300 \text{ cups} + 500 \text{ cups} = 800 \text{ cups} \]

Since the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 800 cups, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. The total amount of feed for the day is:
\[ 800 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 800 \text{ cups} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break down the cost for 16 glasses:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost is:

\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:

\[
\boxed{64}

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by determining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - (3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours) = 4 hours - 5.5 hours = -1.5 hours.
   - Since the time remaining is negative, it means he has already completed the journey.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 120 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{First month downloads} = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 70% of the downloads in the second month (since it reduced by 30%):
\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since Carlos has to pay $90 to plant the tree initially, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost of $90.

We set up the equation:
\[ 7.5n = 90 \]

Solving for \(n\):
\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

The percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the profit the merchant would make by choosing between the two purchase plans, we need to calculate the value of each item after the market increase and then find the difference between the two values.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[
\text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[
\text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we find the difference in value between the two options to determine the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Value of electronic gadgets} - \text{Value of jewelry} = 8096 - 5125 = 2971
\]

Therefore, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets over the jewelry is:
\[
\boxed{2971}
\]"

Then, they travel northwards for 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual teaching earnings are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$20/\text{hour} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual coaching earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's do the calculations:

\[ 35 \times 50 \times 20 = 3500 \times 20 = 70000 \]
\[ 15 \times 50 \times 30 = 750 \times 30 = 22500 \]

Adding both earnings together gives her annual salary:
\[ 70000 + 22500 = 92500 \]

So, Jill's annual salary is $92,500."

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**
   - Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time Marissa has:**
   - Total time = 3 hours
   - Time already spent = 2 hours
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance = 6 miles
   - Remaining time = 1 hour
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters of liquid. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we have \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) liters of liquid left.

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of liquid is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Water from the orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- Water from the pineapple drink: \( 9 \) liters.

Adding these together:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters. Let's convert this to a decimal for clarity:
\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \]

However, the final numerical answer in fraction form is:

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Then we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then find out the total cost.

First, we calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days:
\[
\text{Total servings} = \text{Servings per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, we determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{\text{Total servings}}{\text{Servings per carton}} = \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he covered from the start of his trip to his first stop, and then from his first stop to his second stop.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.
3. The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance to his second stop and the distance to his first stop. This is \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, which means it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, the total time spent on one dog per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This will help us determine how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy. 

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 packs is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times \$5.00/\text{pack} = \$75.00 \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money John has left after buying the video games. He started with $195 and spent $160.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after his purchases, so we can verify the remaining money:

\[
35 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the total amount spent and the remaining amount match, we can conclude that John indeed has $5 left after his purchases.

John started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them. Therefore, he still has 0 lego sets.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking in the given times. The distance she can run in 2 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 16 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies into 8 pieces each, so the total number of pieces was:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is 26."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings as follows:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50g (300g / 5 servings), the amount of chips that can be eaten is:

\[ \text{Amount of chips} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams/serving} = 40 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 40 grams."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday:** She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).
3. After purchasing the package, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used \( x \) post-it notes from the package.
4. After placing the post-it notes on the coffee cups and using the initial 80 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen eggs per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen eggs per day} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ 42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 294 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM, which is a 3-hour trip.

The formula for time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Since the distance is the same for both the outbound and return trip, we can use the speed for the return trip, which is 6 mph.

Let's denote the distance as \( D \). The time taken for the return trip is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{D}{6} \]

We know that the distance \( D \) is the same as the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours at 10 mph:
\[ D = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now we can calculate the time for the return trip:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the days, we first need to calculate the revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference in revenue: \(\$520 - \$480 = \$40\)

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is \$40.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

First, we know that the adopted kittens are 7.

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens, the number of kittens from Patchy, and the number of kittens from Trixie:

\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, the number of bags she can fill is 28 / 2 = 14 bags. 

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for one visit and then divide the total amount of money he has by this cost.

The cost for one visit to the movies is the cost of a ticket plus the cost of popcorn:
\[ \text{Cost per visit} = \$7 + \$7 = \$14 \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost per visit:

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the maximum allowable weight of the boxes:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck (the weight of the boxes) is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the maximum allowable weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

First, we start with the original bill amount:
\[ \text{Original bill} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we add the 25% delivery fee to the original bill. To calculate the 25% fee:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

Adding this fee to the original bill:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:
\[ \$57.00 \]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of $1300
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two different rates of pension payment: the initial rate and the increased rate after 20 years.

1. **Initial Rate (Years 1-20):**
   - Marcy receives $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
   - After 20 years, she will have accumulated a pension value of $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Increased Rate (Years 21-30):**
   - Starting from year 21, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of year 21 is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for years 21-30 is 5% of $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000.

Therefore, after 30 years, Marcy's annual pension will be $50,000."

     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year.
   - The reduced monthly charge is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Adding the costs for both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{1596}

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the miles per gallon (mpg) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, knowing that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Gallons in tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 300 miles."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- Level 1: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[
1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since a year has 365 days:
\[
365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}
\]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[
2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we add the dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food needed in the first year:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}

"First, let's determine how much laundry Sarah does. According to the problem, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we calculate how much laundry Sarah does in terms of David's laundry. The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much David does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4:

\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:

\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in the better price (packages of 2 for $1 each) is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in the worse price (packages of 3 for $2.50 each) is $15.
- The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."

3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add the number of pets each one has:

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 6 pets.
- Jan has 18 pets.

So, the total number of pets is \(4 + 6 + 18 = 28\).

The final numerical answer is 28."
"Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age = A
- Jackson's age = J
- Corey's age = C
- James' age = 10

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, we can solve for Corey's age using the third relationship:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age is 11, we can use the second relationship to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Using the first relationship, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"

"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C \) is two times the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Then, we find the number of rabbits:
\[ R = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, we find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Total number of students = 200

Number of boys = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80\)

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = \(200 - 80 = 120\)

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80\)

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = \(120 - 80 = 40\)

The final numerical answer is 40."
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \)."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which means she has a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will remain with is \(80 - 40 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing up the rings from each friend:

\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first add up all the pages from his textbooks:

Solo has 4 days left to read the remaining pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day on average, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Total pages / Days left
Pages per day = 39 / 4 = 9.75 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 9.75 pages per day."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

1. Determine the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to cover all 14 segments:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   So, 750 pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 108 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours:

1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours we've calculated is the number of hours he watched on Wednesday:

7 - 6 = 1 hour

Since he watched 1 hour on Wednesday, and each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), he watched:

1 / 0.5 = 2 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more, we can verify the number of cookies he baked:

\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he has:

\[ 115 - 5 = 110 \]

This confirms that the number of cookies Henry baked last year is indeed 50. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to determine the total cost of the gas without the cashback, and then subtract the total cashback.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

The cashback is $.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtracting the total cashback from the total cost of the gas gives:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate together:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times \frac{20}{20} \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

However, we are only interested in the time it takes her to row the distance to the shore, which is 64 seconds.

Now, we need to calculate how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 64 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 6.4 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 12.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the quantities given and use them to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

So, the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the original price: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the original price: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

So, the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 180 - 180 = $0 \]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Here, \(x\) represents the number of teaspoons of sugar. We can solve for \(x\) by cross-multiplying:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially imported is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.40 = 56000

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After running for 3 hours at 10 mph, Rosie has 4 hours left to run at 5 mph. Now, let's calculate the distance she can run in the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie starts with 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters. This means that 20 letters were already stamped before Jennie began stamping. Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, this indicates that Jennie added 30 - 20 = 10 letters to the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, when Jennie began, there were 20 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters."
"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she had \( x - 3 \) spoons left.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she then had \( x - 3 + 5 = x + 2 \) spoons.

We know that after adding the spoons from her husband, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons. 

The final numerical answer is:
10"

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Three times the cost of a pepper. Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. **Cost of an orange**: 5 dollars less than the cost of a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the fruits Dillon is buying:

- **Total cost for watermelons**: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- **Total cost for peppers**: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- **Total cost for oranges**: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:

\[
180 + 300 + 400 = 880
\]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\) dollars."
"To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour.

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the revenue from each patient is:
\[ \text{Revenue per patient} = \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for each patient:
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- Therefore, the cost for each patient is:
\[ \text{Cost per patient} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the profit per patient by subtracting the cost from the revenue:
\[ \text{Profit per patient} = 60 - 200 = -140 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the profit per patient is negative, the hospital incurs a loss of $140 per patient.

Finally, to find the total profit from 500 patients, we multiply the loss per patient by the number of patients:
\[ \text{Total profit} = 500 \times (-140) = -70000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the hospital's total profit from these visits is:
\[ \boxed{-70000} \]"
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, the number of elves who quit is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \). This leaves \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) elves.
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. This leaves \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"In June, Joseph's expenditure was $500 - $60 = $440.

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

Tickets used by Pam for the roller coaster:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Tickets used by Pam for the luge:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Total tickets used by Pam:
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times.

Tickets used by Fred for the roller coaster:
\[ 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Tickets used by Fred for the luge:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Total tickets used by Fred:
\[ 24 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 36 \text{ tickets} \]

Finally, let's add the total tickets used by Pam and Fred:
\[ 24 \text{ tickets} + 36 \text{ tickets} = 60 \text{ tickets} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Miles on Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can use this information to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. Let's denote the miles he walked on Wednesday as \( W \). The total mileage can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ 4 + 24 + W = 41 \]

Now, we solve for \( W \):

\[ 28 + W = 41 \]
\[ W = 41 - 28 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we first need to find out how many car washes he gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply this by 12 months in a year:

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we multiply the total number of car washes by the cost of each car wash:

\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$720."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Given that there are 27 unicorns in total and one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[
\text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the items before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the items:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, adding the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
- The first test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the first test is:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
- The second test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the second test is:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs (\( B = 12 \)), we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of pink gumballs (\( P \)):
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ 20\% \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"

"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups.

The cost of nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of nonfood items before tax:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%:
\[ \text{Tax} = 7 \times 0.10 = 0.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items to get the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items to get the overall total cost:
\[ 8 + 7.70 = 15.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost including tax is:
\[ \boxed{15.70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach for one client is 2 * $2 = $4. The cost of one pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total cost for one client is $4 + $5 = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare in a year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvest cycles in a year. Therefore, the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Next, since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125. 

The final numerical answer is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, so there were 0 bees. After 15 bees returned, there were 15 bees. After 60 bees left, there were 15 - 60 = -45 bees. Since the number of bees cannot be negative, this means all the bees that returned and some more left, resulting in a net loss of 45 bees. So, there were -45 bees, which means the hive is empty.

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:** In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before and haven't returned yet return to the hive. Since there were 60 bees that left and 15 that returned, 45 bees are still not in the hive. Therefore, in the last 6 hours, all 45 bees that left return to the hive.

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

The final numerical answer is:
45"

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So we set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came to get their bicycles inflated.

The cost for one bicycle is:
\[ 2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

For 5 bicycles:
\[ 5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 3 people came to get their tricycles inflated.

The cost for one tricycle is:
\[ 3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 75 \text{ cents} \]

For 3 tricycles:
\[ 3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 1 person came to get their unicycle inflated.

The cost for one unicycle is:
\[ 1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

For 1 unicycle:
\[ 1 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we sum the costs for all the vehicles:
\[ 250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants ate one final fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 38 \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours he spends each day and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both sets of days to find the total hours per week:
- Total hours per week = hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday days + hours on Tuesday and Thursday days
- Total hours per week = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, we calculate the total hours for the entire semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- Total hours in the semester = total hours per week \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total hours in the semester = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours."
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet/baguette} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches/baguette}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order:
\[ \boxed{1400} \text{ bananas} \]"
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, Blake's total distance is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, Kelly's total distance is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distances they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Raphael spent, we need to add up the cost of each item he bought.

Adding these together gives us the total amount spent:
$6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 34."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we first need to determine the depth of the water on Tuesday and then calculate the depth on Wednesday based on that.

1. **Determine the depth on Tuesday:**
   - The depth on Monday is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet.
   - Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is \(17 + 7 = 24\) feet.

2. **Determine the depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - So, the depth on Wednesday is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) feet.

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by each person and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine the number of price increases that occur in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases is:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

The price of the bag of marbles after each increase can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the original price is the principal, and the increase rate is the interest rate. The formula for the price after \( n \) increases is:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P_0 \) is the original price, \( r \) is the increase rate, and \( n \) is the number of increases.

Here, the original price \( P_0 \) is $20, the increase rate \( r \) is 20% or 0.20, and the number of increases \( n \) is 18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 12.3797 \]

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 12.3797 \approx 247.594 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:
\[ \boxed{247.59} \]"
"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - One red car costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total value of the red cars is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - One action figure costs $5.
   - Therefore, the total value of the action figures is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we sum up the values of all the toys:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total value of all toys is \( 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"First, let's calculate the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. 

Missed income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will pay $90 for the service. 

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

More money if she hires the accountant = Missed income - Cost of hiring the accountant
More money if she hires the accountant = $105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €102 = €435

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €435 = €1065

So, the final numerical answer is €1065."
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, to make 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age \( S \):
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the legs from the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the legs from the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

Then, we calculate the legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum up the legs from all the creatures:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel and cut each potato. 

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

To add these times together, we need to convert the time to cut one potato into minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equal to \( \frac{5}{60} = \frac{1}{12} \) minutes.

So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is:
\[ 1.5 + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{18}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{19}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Billy to peel and cut 60 potatoes. We multiply the time it takes to prepare one potato by 60:
\[ 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 5 \times 19 = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( 10 \) dollars per gallon, and they made a profit of $25, so:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. The correct approach is to consider the cost of ingredients per gallon. The cost of ingredients per gallon is:

\[ \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} = 3 + 2 = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Now, we can use the profit formula again:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = -20 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. The correct approach is to consider the profit as the difference between the revenue and the total cost, which includes the cost of ingredients. The correct equation should be:

\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this, we need to follow the steps Zaid takes with his salary and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350 dollars."
"To find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to determine the number of crabs each of them has individually and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). Therefore, we have:
\[ B = 40 \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore, we have:
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore, we have:
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we can find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together by summing the number of crabs each of them has:
\[ R + M + B = 46 + 36 + 40 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then add the totals together.

For the first week:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Adding the totals for both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's find out Mark's age two years ago. Since Jan is 30, two years ago she was 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 14. If Mark was 5 years less than that, then Mark was 9 years old two years ago.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
Mark's current age = 9 + 2 = 11 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is:
Jean's current age = Mark's current age + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13 years old.

The final numerical answer is 13."
"To determine the winning margin between the two teams, we first need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the first team, each runner completes their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times of the two teams:

Therefore, the faster team will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:

\[
P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{106} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at a rate of $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend will pay:
Each friend's share = Total cost / 3
Each friend's share = $102 / 3 = $34.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Given that he collects 2 peaches per minute, the total number of peaches he collects is 180 * 2 = 360 peaches. 

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for all the ducks combined.

Given that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Insects needed per day for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day for the entire flock of ten ducks, we multiply the amount needed per day for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Insects needed per day for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.

First, let's calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year:
- Tom plants 10 trees.
- Tom chops down 2 trees.
- Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Now, let's calculate the number of trees after 10 years:
- Starting number of trees = 50.
- Net increase over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
- Number of trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Next, we need to account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years:
- 30% of 130 trees die = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
- Number of trees left after 30% die = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** Sue starts with 18 pink flamingos.

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos and paint them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back and painted white.

3. **After the prank on Saturday morning:**
   - Sue has \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos left.
   - The neighbors put back 6 white flamingos.

4. **On Sunday morning, they add another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - Sue now has \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) pink flamingos.

5. **At noon on Sunday, the number of white flamingos:**
   - Sue has 6 white flamingos.

6. **Calculate the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Number of pink flamingos: 30
   - Number of white flamingos: 6
   - Difference: \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

Now, we sum up all the cards she has collected over the three months:
\[
20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total payment from both publishers.

First, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A each week, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B each week, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total payment Mark receives in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

"To calculate how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- 5% of $2000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 2000 = 100 \).

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
- $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John made in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His new weekly salary is $2100.
- Therefore, his total salary for the year is \( 52 \times 2100 = 1092000 \).

Additionally, John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:
- $1092000 (from his new salary) + $5000 (one-time reward) = $1097000.

The final numerical answer is:
1097000"

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let's denote this score by \( x \). The sum of all six test scores should be 558:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance for each period of his biking and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first period:
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first period is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the second period:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the second period is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance Micheal rode his bike:

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \text{ grams} \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total after three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that on Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates. So, the total cost for 6 plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, so the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Sara mows the lawn as \( x \). The total amount of money she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * x = $4x.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn is $10 + $4x. We need this amount to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes.

So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 10 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 4x \geq 60 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x \geq 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected every day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Total eggs collected:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks around.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day. Since the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, and there were 100 customers on the first day, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]

2. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]

3. Simplify the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

From \( B = 4S \) and \( B = 2S - 16 \), we have:
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[
\text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Now, determine their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:

\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

\[
\boxed{70}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers he plants is 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers. 

The final numerical answer is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.

The amount spent on advertising in the first year is $15000.

The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the first year's amount:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos: $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji: $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost: $90 + $90 = $180

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider the time it takes for each part of his trip.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester, the travel time by car is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total travel time will be the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip:
\[ 6 \text{ days (bus to Rochester)} + 3 \text{ days (car from Rochester)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
- Total cards: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito before any upgrades or discounts:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Now, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink, so we add that to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces together.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} \]"
"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate the number of watermelons that were ready:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark then pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

2. Calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. Determine the total number of penguins that leave the snow to either swim or go into the cave:
   \[
   12 \text{ (jumping in) } + 12 \text{ (going into the cave) } = 24
   \]

4. Subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins to find out how many are still sunbathing:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"To determine how many tomato vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the problem, one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce per week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 tomato vines. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new ones. Ram starts with 25 pens and can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. After this, he will have 24 pens left (25 - 1 = 24).
3. **Second Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more empty pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 23 pens left (24 - 1 = 23).
4. **Continuing the Process**: He continues this process until he no longer has enough empty pens to make a new one.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we need to determine how many times he can use 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This is equivalent to dividing the number of empty pens he has by 5.

Let's calculate the number of new pens he can make:

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each girl based on the information given.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68
\]

The sum of the ages of the three girls is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

After students have left through exit B, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 280 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We already know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Dolly has two books and reads them, so she reads 2 books. Additionally, Dolly reads Pandora's book, which is 1 book. Therefore, Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has one book and reads it, so she reads 1 book. Additionally, Pandora reads Dolly's books, which are 2 books. Therefore, Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, Dolly and Pandora read 3 + 3 = 6 books.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pages per week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ pages per week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages per week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used in a month. He has a plan of 1000 minutes per month. He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes he uses for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other people. So, the total number of minutes used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of minutes used from the total number of minutes on his plan:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium, the difference in the number of snails is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2f) \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. So, the total cost before the discount is:

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean pays:

Final amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, the final numerical answer is $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies.

The total cost is:
$12 (ingredients) + $43 (birthday presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Isabelle split this total cost evenly among her three parents, so we divide $96 by 3.

Each person paid:
$96 / 3 = $32

"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this, let's first determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Sue's sister's total cookies:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
- \(46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\)

Sue's sister's total calories:
- \(18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\)

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the total calories Sue's sister consumed from the total calories Sue consumed.

\(9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories}\)

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

The second class has 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. We know the total number of boys in the school is 30. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 17 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( w_1 \) be the number of wolves killed last night.
- Let \( c_1 \) be the number of cougars killed last night.
- Let \( w_2 \) be the number of wolves killed today.
- Let \( c_2 \) be the number of cougars killed today.

From the problem, we know:
- \( w_1 = 10 \)
- \( c_1 = 15 \)
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \( w_2 = 3c_2 \)
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night: \( c_2 = c_1 - 3 \)

First, we calculate \( c_2 \):
\[ c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate \( w_2 \):
\[ w_2 = 3c_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( w_1 = 10 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( c_1 = 15 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( w_2 = 36 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( c_2 = 12 \)

Total number of animals killed:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will then have:

\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ cows} \]

We are asked to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 12 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:

Therefore, Brady has a total of **45 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ J_a + 8 = 52 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples. The problem also states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]

Substituting the value of \( J_a \):

\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

So, Jamal has 48 bananas. Now, we need to find out how many fruits Andrea has. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, and the same number of apples as Jamal. Therefore, Andrea has:

\[ \text{Number of apples Andrea has} = J_a = 44 \]

\[ \text{Number of bananas Andrea has} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits Andrea has} = 44 + 24 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to find the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Thus, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change given back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

1. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the collar, rosette, and body of the sweater, we get the total stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 - 900 = 630
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2.
\[
\text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
\]

Thus, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is:
\[
\boxed{315}
\]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to multiply the number of packets of each type of seed by their respective costs and then add the totals together.

For the tomato seeds:
20 packets * $40/packet = $800

For the celery seeds:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the totals:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of these lines to memorize:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of these lines to memorize:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   Summing up the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene:
   \[
   54 + 36 + 48 = 138
   \]

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
\[
\boxed{138}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D on them, are:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time required for each type of hole.

For the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- Therefore, for 30 small holes, the time required is:
  \[
  30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

For the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- Therefore, for 15 large holes, the time required is:
  \[
  15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we add the time required for both types of holes:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}\):
\[
240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start by noting the current sum of their ages, which is given as 20. 

If we let Mico's current age be \( m \) and Marco's current age be \( r \), then we have:
\[ m + r = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( m + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( r + 10 \). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (m + 10) + (r + 10) = m + r + 20 \]

Since we know that \( m + r = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ m + r + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each:

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \]

So, the cost of the popsicles is $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each:

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \]

So, the cost of the ice cream bars is $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7."
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding the spots of all the cobras and mambas together gives:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people.

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

So, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads. Finally, we will divide the length used by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

1. **Calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:**
   Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the length used by the sterling silver beads:**
   The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtract the length used by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace.
   \[
   \text{Length used by sterling silver beads} = 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. Divide the length used by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead.
   \[
   \text{Number of sterling silver beads} = \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up the totals for all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

The final numerical answer is 90."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. We can break this down into the rows of 8 stars and the rows of 6 stars, and then find the remaining stars which will be in rows of 5 stars.

First, calculate the number of stars in the rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ stars/row} = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, calculate the number of stars in the rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ stars/row} = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, add the stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[ 24 \text{ stars} + 12 \text{ stars} = 36 \text{ stars} \]

Subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:
\[ 76 \text{ stars} - 36 \text{ stars} = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Finally, determine the number of rows of 5 stars by dividing the remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ stars}}{5 \text{ stars/row}} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

The time taken to travel a certain distance is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles/hour. So, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can start by determining the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars for adults = 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Finally, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

Chocolate bars per child = 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she works for 150 minutes. 

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we can calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes and then multiply by $5.

Number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes = 150 / 10 = 15

Therefore, the total earnings = 15 intervals * $5 = $75

The final numerical answer is $75."
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.
3. Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.**

- Mike's new points: \(21 + 1 = 22\)
- Jim's points remain: 18
- Tony's new points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

Now, we sum the points of all three players:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The total points all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner), the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/member} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the cost of the miles driven plus the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is:

- Books sold in the second year: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65

Each book sells for $20.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year:

\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The final numerical answer is 1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's determine the number of days Watson works in April. April has 30 days, and he works 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of days he works in April is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings from his hourly wage. He works 10 hours each day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Over 20 days, his total earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 20 \text{ days} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$2000 \]

Additionally, since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Over 4 weeks, his total bonus is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$300/\text{week} = \$1200 \]

Adding his total earnings from his hourly wage and his total bonus, we get:
\[ \$2000 + \$1200 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:
\[ \$3200 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 3200 \]"
"John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles against. 

To find out how many people he beats, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestles 20 people in total and beats 16 of them, the number of people he loses to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine the number of loaves sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight Sandy needs to lose in 4 weeks is 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
- Savings on two tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Original price of one packet of milk: Let's assume it was $x (we don't know the original price, but we know the discount is $0.5)
- Discounted price of one packet of milk: $x - $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $x - $0.5
- Savings on four packets of milk: ($x - $0.5) * 4

Since we don't know the original price of one packet of milk, we can't calculate the exact savings on the milk. However, the problem doesn't require us to know the original price of the milk to find the total savings on the ice cream. The savings on the milk are not specified in terms of a numerical value, so we can only calculate the savings on the ice cream.

Therefore, the total savings on the ice cream is $4.

The final numerical answer is:
$4"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 3, which is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 5, which is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = number of extra arms + number of extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend is:
Total amount - Amount to save = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, to find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total costs from the amount he can spend:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total costs = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

The final numerical answer is $2050."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

First, let's determine the daily egg consumption for the three people who eat three eggs each day:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, let's determine the daily egg consumption for the two people who eat two eggs each day:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Finally, we multiply the daily egg consumption by 7 to find the weekly egg consumption:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age. We know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\). Then, six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation \(P / 2 = 60000\) by 2 to find \(P\):
   \[
   P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Also, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2, so we rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now we can combine the terms:

\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by Solomon's father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women left at the party after some people left.

First, let's find the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
- Number of men: 25
- Number of women: 15
- Total number of people: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

This means that 10 people left the party. We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since 10 people in total left, the number of women who left is:
\[
10 - (22 - 40) = 10 - (-18) = 10 + 18 = 28
\]

Since there were originally 15 women, the number of women who stayed at the party is:
\[
15 - 28 = 15 - 28 = -13
\]

This indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the problem statement and calculations. The correct interpretation should be that 22 men stayed, so the number of women who left is:
\[
10 - (22 - 40) = 10 - (-18) = 10 + 18 = 28
\]

Since the number of women who left is 28, and there were originally 15 women, the number of women who stayed is:
\[
15 - 28 = -13
\]

This indicates an error in the problem statement or interpretation. Given the problem constraints, the correct number of women who stayed is:
\[
15 - 28 = -13 \text{ (impossible, recheck the problem statement)}

"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Adding the 46 pencils that Meg has, we get the total number of pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, we need to consider that each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of both the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we need to determine how many ice cubes are equivalent to cooling by 65 degrees. We do this by dividing 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

This means that 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much weaker the total volume is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded is equivalent to 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

\[

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. He then buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the 8 lollipops he had left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats a total of 3 + 2 = 5 lollipops. Subtracting these from the 36 lollipops, Oscar has 36 - 5 = 31 lollipops.

"The phone is currently at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. 

To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:
100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we need to find out how long it will take to charge 40 percentage points at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes.

To find the total time in minutes:
40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours:
120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the $8 rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - Since the rewards used were $8, the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - The final price after applying the coupon is $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- State tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles:
   - 40 percent of 220 castles are ruined.
   - 40% of 220 = 0.40 * 220 = 88 ruined castles.

2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Half of 88 ruined castles = 0.5 * 88 = 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we first need to calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each
- Total installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have together.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Adding these together gives:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 guns. If these 24 guns are to be shared equally among the four people, we divide the total number of guns by 4:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they shared them equally. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

For the suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces.

For the fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \(1 \times 70 = 70\) ounces.

Adding these together gives the total amount of sugar needed:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge = \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces.

So, the final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Purchase Value:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Price Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value After First Year:**
   Maria now has 8 shares at the new price of $12 each.
   \[
   \text{Value After First Year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

4. **Second Year Price Decrease:**
   The stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9
   \]

5. **Value After Second Year:**
   Maria now has 8 shares at the final price of $9 each.
   \[
   \text{Final Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72
   \]

Thus, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \). According to the problem, the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ 2 \times H + 4 \times C = 2 \times 40 + 4 \times 20 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). Therefore, the total number of balls he would have is:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (added balls) = 7 balls.

However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls. Of the 3 balls that dropped, 2 are caught by people in the crowd and 1 is lost. So, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) + 2 (caught balls) = 6 balls.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling on stage with 6 balls."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of the animals and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

First, let's establish the weights of the animals based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the weight of the container itself, which is 20 pounds.

The total weight is:
\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up all the outfits she received.

First, we know that Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

Next, Laurel received twice the amount of outfits her friend gave her at her baby shower. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add all these outfits together:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 \]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson ran in June, given that he increased his daily running distance by 1/5 of his original distance and then ran this new distance for the entire month of June.

First, let's determine the new daily distance Tyson runs:
- Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters.
- The increase in distance is 1/5 of 5000 meters, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- Therefore, the new daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson ran in June. June has 30 days, so:
- The total distance Tyson ran in June is \( 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \).

The final numerical answer is:
180000"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

- Juice Box C costs 11 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 9 dollars.
- Therefore, Juice Box C costs 11 - 9 = 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

The final numerical answer is 2."

First, we calculate the number of legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the two results together to get the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount, and then apply the discount.

The cost of one shirt is $30. Therefore, the cost of 2 shirts without any discount is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount. A 40% discount on $60 is:
\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original total cost gives us the final amount Davos paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from making silos instead of tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:

\[ 10\% \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and the daisies require 30 plant pots, the roses will need:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots} \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea had $36 initially. She spent some of this money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave her brother $4. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent or gave away is $11 + $4 = $15.

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ S + 15 = 36 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ S = 36 - 15 \]
\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 + 3 = 9 hours

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.

Total time for shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The shows time (6 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent. Let's denote the total time he spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 6 hours:
\[ 0.30 \times T = 6 \]
\[ T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total time \( T \) is 20 hours. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Time spent sightseeing: 40% of 20 hours

First, we know the height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

So, the total amount spent on gumballs is $2. This means the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 5.3333 pounds."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third and back to first) is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[ \frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80} \]

This fraction represents the fraction of a day the train travels before needing service. To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of this fraction:
\[ \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ \text{Total detour distance} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Detour distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total trip duration:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time for detour} + \text{Time to home} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on the third test. The equation for the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is:
\[ 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

Three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21. \]

The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the points Erin had before the additional 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin now has 24 points and she scored 14 points recently, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).
4. The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep. From the other half of her sheep, which is also 15 sheep, she gets 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk she collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how much energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the usage of his air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we need to calculate the energy usage before and after the reduction, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the energy usage per day before the reduction:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
- Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, the energy usage per day is \( 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \).

Next, let's calculate the energy usage per day after the reduction:
- Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
- Therefore, the new usage per day is \( 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \).

Now, let's find the daily energy savings:
- The daily energy savings is \( 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \).

Finally, let's calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
- The total energy savings over 30 days is \( 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \).

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
- \( 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \).

So, the number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is 135."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[29.33\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100
   \]
3. **Initial number of corns**: The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Since Allan initially has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60
   \]
5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis**: Now, we add the new number of corns and the new total number of cannolis:
   \[
   60 + 100 = 160
   \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is the difference between his goal and the steps he had left after the jog, which is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps. 

So, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby starts reading 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he will be:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ minutes early} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} - 10 \text{ employees} = 30 \text{ employees}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of taffy: $4.50
Cost of seashells: $1.50
Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. Each pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of dangerous candles:
   \[
   \text{Total dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500
   \]

2. Calculate the number of dangerous candles that do not have the defect (smell like wet dog):
   \[
   \text{Dangerous candles without defect} = 99\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.99 \times 2500 = 2475
   \]

3. Calculate the number of dangerous candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog):
   \[
   \text{Dangerous candles with defect} = 2500 - 2475 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"First, let's determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 6 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 20 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 14 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees, and doesn't gather any from the average trees. So, her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees and \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A_{\text{tall}} \) and \( A_{\text{short}} \):
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

For the next 6 days (days 8 through 13), Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 1800 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 1800 \text{ km} = 2840 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, his total capital now is:

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months:
- The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost for the next 2 months is $12 per month.
- Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the remaining 8 months (months 9 to 16):
- The cost for the remaining 8 months is $14 per month.
- Total cost for the remaining 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for 2 years = Cost for the first 6 months + Cost for the next 2 months + Cost for the remaining 8 months
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 + $24 + $112 = $184.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $184."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of both jeans. The total cost is:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine how much he saved from each. The amount saved from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's verify the savings. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, which sums up to $6, matching the total savings.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

So, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 180 birds.

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) for the dinner she ordered."

\[ x = 100 - 50 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. The caterer was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. There were 36 guests initially, so half of the guests would be:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared is:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost (100% - 20% = 80%).

To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00

Therefore, the final amount Charlotte has to pay for her order is $132.00."

     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]

2. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
     \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate the amount of money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops among his four friends. Each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. Since Rory and her mom have 2 pieces, the weight of the pieces they have is 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces. Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

The final numerical answer is 15 ounces."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Adding these together:
34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This makes a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock together gives us the total cost:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00 for the total ingredients.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave} = \text{Time Wayne takes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute}
\]

Since Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

"To determine the final temperature of the house, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Total temperature increase from baking = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window**:
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from opening the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes, we get:
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores an additional 26 points.
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]
So, Joey's new score is 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores an additional 10 points.
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]
So, Marcy's new score is 235 points.

Now, we find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]
So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

These 31 sneakers were sold to the department store for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling all the sneakers:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is 112."
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and one soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 13 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the original cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20 \text{ balloons}} = \$45 \text{ per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \text{ per balloon} \]

Now, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \text{ balloons} \times \$65 \text{ per balloon} = \$11050 \]

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 of them. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires Jenna has left is:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies Jenna received from the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:
\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ \$6400 \]

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \text{ cubic feet} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1920 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. 

To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum them up.

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Hay**: 42 bales, each 75 pounds.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck:

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to first calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry item per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has after each day, taking into account the number of shoes he gains and loses.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gains 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
So, after Monday, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
So, after Wednesday, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
So, after Friday, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
So, after Saturday, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils.
   \[
   \text{Total initial pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   \[
   \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).

We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (allergic to both)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| \]

Substituting the value of \( |A \cup B| \):
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and Tom and his wife are going together, so the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but it is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend. To find the weekend price, we calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
So, the hotel costs $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the razors before any discounts or coupons are applied. Heather buys 2 packs of razors, and each pack costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. This means for every pack of razors Heather buys, she gets another pack for free. Since she is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 packs for free. Thus, she only pays for 2 packs, which is the same as the original cost of 2 packs:

\[ 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost:

\[ 8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Heather is buying 2 packs of razors, and each pack contains 4 razors. Therefore, the total number of razors she is getting is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:

\[ \frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.75 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Since the question asks for the final numerical answer in cents, we convert $0.75 to cents:

\[ 0.75 \text{ dollars} = 75 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{9 \times 64 + 1 \times 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of cheerleaders in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of the cheerleaders is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[
\boxed{53}

"Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 25n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 25:
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and then add the additional gifts she bought as a surprise.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her 5 friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts as a surprise. Therefore, the total number of gifts she bought is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[26\]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Twice the rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Couch's length} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood and then decide which is the most cost-effective.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for the 2 x 4 piece of wood:
- Frederick can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood.
- The cost of a 2 x 4 piece of wood is $4.
- Therefore, the cost per stick for a 2 x 4 piece of wood is:
  \[
  \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost per stick for the 2 x 8 piece of wood:
- Frederick can get 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood.
- The cost of a 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6.
- Therefore, the cost per stick for a 2 x 8 piece of wood is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}
  \]

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should use this type of wood to maximize the number of sticks he can make.

Now, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
- The cost of one 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6.
- Therefore, the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy is:
  \[
  \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
  \]

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, Frederick can make:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of legs Mario's 6 sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 bus trips each day.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- Thus, the total cost of her bus trips per week is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we find the difference between the total cost of her bus trips and the cost of the bus pass:
- The difference is \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the problem states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the farm having half as many sheep as the zoo does, which has 20 sheep).

The zoo has 20 sheep and 10 cows (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 / 3 = 20 cows, but the problem states the zoo has 20 cows, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm does, which has 30 cows).

The total number of animals on the farm and zoo combined is 30 cows + 15 sheep + 20 sheep + 20 cows = 85 animals."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Andy has 206 days from December 31st to July 19th (inclusive). To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{206 \text{ days}} \approx 510.58 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to burn approximately 511 calories per day to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 511 \]"
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings for the week are:

"To find out how much money Julie has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money.
4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find the final amount left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes.
\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
\[ \text{Remaining money after clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

3. Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining $400 to find the final amount left.
\[ \text{Remaining money after CDs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the final amount of money Julie has left is $300."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

So, the final numerical answer is $288."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total money to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 32 \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer in a separate line:

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \(12 \times 1.50 = 18\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity after adding the new device:
- The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(12 + 2 = 14\) kilowatts per hour.
- The daily cost is \(14 \times 1.50 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly cost before adding the new device is \(18 \times 7 = 126\) dollars.
- The weekly cost after adding the new device is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:
- The difference is \(147 - 126 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is one-fourth of a house. Therefore, the rate of one person is:

\[
\text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ house per day}
\]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be:

\[
\text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint \(\frac{5}{4}\) of a house in one day. To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate:

\[
\text{Days to paint one house} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ days}
\]

Since we need the answer in hours, we convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

\[
\text{Hours to paint one house} = \frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C_O = 20 + 2 = 22 \]
So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]
So, Jenna has 66 chairs.

Now, we need to determine the number of sofas Jenna has. According to the problem, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]
So, Jenna has 64 sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs. The total number of sofas is:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]
The total number of chairs is:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]
Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have together is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week. We know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. For the remaining 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week and 6 hours in one of those weeks.

Let's calculate the total hours step by step:

1. For the 6 weeks where he worked out for 4 hours each week:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For the 2 weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off (which is 21). So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 in 8 years, which means:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

So, Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of Jame and his cousin now is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. \( C = 1100 \)

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the second equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substituting the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of girls and boys participating in the scavenger hunt. Since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, each girl brought back \(60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300\) seashells.

To find the total number of seashells brought by each girl, we simply note that each girl brought 300 seashells. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share: $6 + $5 = $11.
   - The following day, he adds another $10: $11 + $10 = $21.
   - He then spends $8: $21 - $8 = $13.

3. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - After spending $8, he has $13.
   - He triples the amount he has left: $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves in the second half of April, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half, and that his total monthly savings target is $1125.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings in the first and second halves of April:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's total monthly savings target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the second half of April, he saves:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$7.00"

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting:**
   Elise writes the entire alphabet once. The alphabet has 26 letters.
   \[
   \text{Letters written in the first rewriting} = 26
   \]

2. **Second Rewriting:**
   Elise writes the entire alphabet again.
   \[
   \text{Letters written in the second rewriting} = 26
   \]

3. **Third Rewriting:**
   Elise writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13.
   \[
   \text{Letters written in the third rewriting} = 13
   \]

4. **Fourth Rewriting:**
   Elise rewrites everything she has already written. This includes the two full alphabets and half of the alphabet.
   \[
   \text{Letters written in the fourth rewriting} = 26 + 26 + 13 = 65
   \]

Now, we sum up all the letters written in each rewriting:
\[
\text{Total letters written} = 26 + 26 + 13 + 65 = 130
\]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[
\boxed{130}

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of toys needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
2. Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's play set.
3. Find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

First, we calculate the number of toys needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so a play set five times larger would have:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set of 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact number of cups Juan must reduce, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume \( R = 4 \) (which would mean the daily recommendation is 4 cups), then Juan's current intake is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cups, and he must reduce it to 4 cups, which means he must reduce by \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

Therefore, the reduction in Juan's coffee intake is:

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs.

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

So, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, which totals to 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time in minutes by the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:

   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's earnings.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, Mitchell's total earnings can be calculated as follows:
\[
21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars per lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[
84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Peter spends each day and then determine how many wooden and plastic action figures he can buy over the week.

First, let's calculate the total amount Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures, we can find out how much he spends each day by dividing his total money by 4:

\[ \text{Daily spending on wooden action figures} = \frac{70}{4} = 17.5 \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{17.5}{5} = 3.5 \]

Since he can't buy half an action figure, he can buy 3 wooden action figures. The cost for these 3 wooden action figures is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

So, the remaining money after buying the wooden action figures is:

\[ 70 - 15 = 55 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $55. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{55}{2} = 27.5 \]

Since he can't buy half an action figure, he can buy 27 plastic action figures. The cost for these 27 plastic action figures is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, the remaining money after buying the plastic action figures is:

\[ 55 - 54 = 1 \]

Since he has $1 left and each action figure costs $5, he can't buy any more action figures with the remaining money.

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 3 + 27 = 30 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

Therefore, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months. If Katina removes $100 every month, the total amount removed over 24 months is \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount. Katina initially has $3000 in her account. After removing $2400, the remaining amount is \(3000 - 2400 = 600\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bread and cheese/condiments:

- Cost of bread: $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. To make 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
- Cost of cheese/condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of cheese/condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese/condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."
"First, we need to determine the total number of crayon pieces Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayon pieces she can melt together to make one muffin. We do this by dividing the total number of crayon pieces by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \]

This means Kate can make 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = \$2592 + \$432 = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is \$11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we need to first calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
\[ \frac{330}{7} = 47.14285714285714 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is:
\[ 47.14 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: Add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   - Half of the starting value: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
   - Adding this to the starting value: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \)
3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result by 5.
   - Dividing by 5: \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \)
4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.
   - Starting value minus 12: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \)

"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we first need to determine how many cards the boy's brother has.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the boy's brother has 2 cards.

Next, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

The temperature that Maggie should set the oven to is:
\[ 520 - (520 \times 0.04) = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \]

Therefore, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 499.2 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the duration of each movie together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's price. Herb's house is worth $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's house price gives us the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups, which is 20 more than what Judy bought. This confirms the number of cups Judy bought.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes she brought is \(12 + 24 = 36\).

Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought is \(40 + 44 = 84\).

The total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is \(36 + 84 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount applied.

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of one box is reduced by 10% of $100.00.

10% of $100.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 100 = 10 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Now, the cost of 2 boxes at the discounted price is:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{180} = 1 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked:

- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.

So, Jill's total hours worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked:

- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

So, John's total hours worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John:

- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \), and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we add up the total number of legs from all the pets:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. He increases this weight by 50%, so the increase is:

\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this to the original weight:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the weight of 12 pounds is too heavy, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break down his purchases and gifts year by year.

**Year 1:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought by saving up: 1 game per month for 12 months = 12 games
- Total games after Year 1: 5 + 12 = 17 games

**Year 2:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought by saving up: 2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games
- Total games after Year 2: 17 (from Year 1) + 5 (from parents) + 24 (bought) = 46 games

**Year 3:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought by saving up: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games
- Total games after Year 3: 46 (from Year 2) + 5 (from parents) + 48 (bought) = 109 games

**Year 4:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought by saving up: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games
- Total games after Year 4: 109 (from Year 3) + 5 (from parents) + 48 (bought) = 162 games

Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 162."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make in 12 hours. Since Ruiz works at a rate of 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours he will make:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Similarly, since Marissa works at a rate of 45 pounds per hour, in 12 hours she will make:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the totals together, the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ \text{Total chocolate} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract that from his original amount of $100.

On Monday, Howard spends $8.
On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Subtracting the total amount spent from his original amount of $100 gives:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can find the total rotations for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]

\[ \text{Total rotations for 400 miles} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

\[ \text{Total rotations for 400 miles} = 400 \times 362.5 \]

\[ \text{Total rotations for 400 miles} = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month:

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

\[ \text{Number of months} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{72}{12} \]

\[ \text{Number of years} = 6 \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps, we can calculate the total number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how much one pump costs. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, and since there are 2 pumps in the bottle, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants:**
   \[
   \text{Butter per dozen} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Dozens per day} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Dozens per week} = 4 \text{ dozens/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ dozens}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozens of croissants:**
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozens} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds}

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ \boxed{65560} \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) are funded at 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 per month.

   First, calculate the monthly funding for the extended period:
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000
   - Increased monthly funding: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000

   Now, calculate the total cost for the extended 45 months:
   - Total cost for 45 months: 45 months * $150,000/month = $6,750,000

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum the initial cost and the extended cost:
   - Total cost: $100,000 (initial) + $6,750,000 (extended) = $6,850,000

Thus, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add the meat consumed by the first three players:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert kb to Mb by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \text{ per car} = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Cost to acquire} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \text{ of } \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a diamond jewel:**
   \[
   \text{Price of a diamond jewel} = \$2000
   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

The total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

\[
16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. The relative speed of Tom with respect to Bob is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour. This means Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Bob is initially 75 miles ahead of Tom. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the initial distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[ x = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the condition that the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, Manny can miss all 10 classes before they don't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, assuming they work all days of the week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the raise and bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the raise amount.
2. Calculate the bonus amount.
3. Add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary.
4. Multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

Let's start with the raise:

- Tim's original monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- Raise amount = 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus:

- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- Bonus amount = 1/2 * $20000 = $10000.

Now, let's add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary:

- New monthly salary = Original salary + Raise + Bonus
- New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, let's calculate the annual salary:

- Annual salary = New monthly salary * 12
- Annual salary = $31000 * 12 = $372000.

Therefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year."

"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the sales from green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400 and this amount is half the total sales from green hats. Therefore, the total sales from green hats in the first month is:
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, the sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month are:
\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we can find the total sales for the two months by adding the sales from the first month and the second month:

"Let's denote the cooking time for rice as \( R \), for beans as \( B \), and for pork as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The cooking time for beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate \( P \):
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 + 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total cooking time for all the food:

   - Almonds: 1/5 pound at $10 per pound
   - Walnuts: 1/3 pound at $15 per pound

   Cost of almonds in the second mixture:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \text{ pound} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$2
   \]

   Cost of walnuts in the second mixture:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$5
   \]

   Total cost of the second mixture:
   \[
   \$2 + \$5 = \$7
   \]

3. **Difference in cost between the two mixtures:**
   \[
   \$10 - \$7 = \$3
   \]

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:

\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:

\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:

\[ S + G = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = \text{Cost of normal brand} + (\text{Cost of normal brand} \times 20\%) \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (5 \times 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 6 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he needs coffee for 7 days:
\[ \text{Total coffee cost} = 7 \times \text{Cost of more expensive brand} \]
\[ \text{Total coffee cost} = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Total coffee cost} = 42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the donut is:
\[ \text{Total cost of donut} = 2 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total coffee cost} + \text{Total cost of donut} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 44 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 in total.

He bought:
- 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, so 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the items he bought:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, the calculation is as follows:

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered in a day - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209 = 203

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 203."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours John attends.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total class hours.

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the basketball court.

Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ \text{Total time spent sleeping} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then share the total equally.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:
\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount equally among the three of them, each person will get:

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(4 + 8 = 12\).

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs one toy per dog.
   - He needs 12 toys for the 12 dogs.
   - So, he buys 12 toys.

3. **Second Purchase:**
   - James went back to see that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs means \(2 \times 12 = 24\) more dogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(12 + 24 = 36\).
   - James needs 36 toys for the 36 dogs.
   - So, he buys 36 toys.

4. **Third Purchase:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(36 - 3 = 33\).
   - James needs 33 toys for the 33 dogs.
   - So, he buys 33 toys.

5. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Adding up all the toys he bought:
     - First purchase: 12 toys
     - Second purchase: 36 toys
     - Third purchase: 33 toys
   - Total toys needed: \(12 + 36 + 33 = 81\).

The total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{81}\)."

Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S \]
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 298 \]

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation for the final length as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to find the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

For ""turtle"" mode:
- Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode would take half the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode.

For ""rabbit"" mode:
- Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode would take half the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, we add the time spent in both modes to find the total time:
- Time spent in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time:
\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write the equation:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month and per year:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves \(20 \times 12 = 240\) coins per year.

Next, we calculate how many coins Rong saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Rong saves \(240 \times 10 = 2400\) coins.

Now, let's determine how many coins Neil saves per month:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

Next, we calculate how many coins Neil saves per year:
- Neil saves \(28 \times 12 = 336\) coins per year.

Now, we calculate how many coins Neil saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Neil saves \(336 \times 10 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil = \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. The amount he leaves with is the difference between the amount he brought and the total bill:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total price for the crate:
\[5 + 6 + 21 = 32\]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to determine the number of each colored square and then calculate the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up the total number of squares:
- Total number of squares = Number of red squares + Number of blue squares + Number of green squares + Number of white squares
- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
- Total area = 68 square feet

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
68"
"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are currently available. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available is:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs required:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of additional chairs that Mia needs to get is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom:
\[
50 + 105 + 65 + 35 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the number of points the class is missing is:
\[
400 - 255 = 145

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We can represent this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Now, we can solve for Gary's truck capacity:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]
\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds of gravel."
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:

\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by 40:

\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount of money raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount of money that needs to be raised:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours required to reach the goal is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water that Colorado City uses for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that Colorado City uses for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City is:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of the river's total water that is used for non-industrial purposes by Colorado City, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:

\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is:

\[ 68\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James paid for picking the blueberries. He paid a flat fee of $20 plus $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost for picking = Flat fee + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
Total cost for picking = $65

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store at $2.5 per pound.

Cost at the store = Price per pound * Number of pounds
Cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
Cost at the store = $75

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store.

Savings = Cost at the store - Total cost for picking
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

So, James saved $10 compared to buying at the store."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original price per computer is:
\[ \text{Original price per computer} = \frac{700}{500} = 1.40 \]

Next, we calculate the new price after a 10% increase. A 10% increase means the new price is 110% of the original price. So, the new price per computer is:
\[ \text{New price per computer} = 1.40 \times 1.10 = 1.54 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 500 \times 1.54 = 770 \]

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she dances.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute.
- Helga taps her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- Therefore, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are at her sides is \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
- If she dances for 5 minutes with her arms at her sides, the total number of taps is \(550 \times 5 = 2750\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Helga taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute.
- Helga taps her left foot at 200 taps per minute.
- Therefore, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
- If she dances for 3 minutes with her arms raised (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes out of the 5 minutes), the total number of taps is \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) taps.

Finally, we add the number of taps from both scenarios to get the combined total number of taps:
\[2750 + 1200 = 3950\]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{3950}\)."

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left after 13 of them were sent to the carpenter for repair:

23 baby chairs - 13 repaired chairs = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, let's add the number of normal chairs left and the number of baby chairs left to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:

150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs.

So, the final numerical answer is 160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of friends including Bryce**: Bryce and four friends make a total of 5 people.
2. **Total number of pizzas**: Since each person ordered their own pizza, there are 5 pizzas.
3. **Total number of pizza slices**: Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Next, we calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends:

4. **Slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends**: They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8\) slices each. Since there are three of them, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

Now, we calculate how many slices were eaten by the remaining two friends:

5. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends**: They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate \(\frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9\) slices each. Since there are two of them, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends is \(2 \times 9 = 18\).

6. **Total slices eaten**: Adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the remaining two friends, we get \(24 + 18 = 42\).

7. **Slices left**: Subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices, we get \(60 - 42 = 18\).

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is \(\boxed{18}\)."

\[
\text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of Topher's shoe as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we have the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \times 4 = 256 \]

Next, we calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \]

Now, we determine how many windows Hannah smashes from the students' cars. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \]

Next, we determine how many windows Hannah smashes from the teachers' cars. She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

First, we calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00). Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means that the number of people remaining by midday is:

\[ \text{Remaining people by midday} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

This means that the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ \text{People who had not voted by 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in that time.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

A pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he will need, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
Substituting the father's age:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[ \boxed{87} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of her French book:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the weight of her English book:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the weight of her history book. The problem states that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to find out how many apples each person has after this exchange:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[
\text{Difference in apples} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, let's determine how much water Peter has left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water used = 30 ounces.
- Water left = 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
2 ounces"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can determine how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the total number of students in the class is 50. We are given the number of students who like to bake, which is 10. We are also given that 5 students like to play basketball. Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as \( M \). According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore, we can write:

\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \). The total number of students in the class is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play music, and play video games. So we can write the equation:

\[ 10 + 5 + 10 + V = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

To find \( V \), we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

\[ V = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is \( 25 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily cost from the new vendor:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The old vendor sold tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor sold 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily cost from the old vendor:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, we find the daily savings:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

Thus, the vendor saves:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles they have.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:
\[
\text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. We need to divide these students into 12 groups of equal size. To find the number of students per group, we perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, which implies we need to find out how many more groups are needed to make the division possible.

To find out how many students would be in each group if we divide 54 students into 6 groups, we perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

This means that 54 students can be divided into 6 groups of 9 students each. Now, to form 12 groups, we need to divide the 54 students into 12 groups. As calculated earlier, this is not possible with whole numbers, so we need to find out how many more groups are needed to make the division possible.

Since 54 students can only be divided into 6 groups of 9 students each, and we need 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed. If we divide 54 students into 12 groups, each group would have:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since we cannot have half students, we need to find the next whole number division. The closest whole number division that fits is 6 groups of 9 students each, which is already given. To form 12 groups, we would need to have 12 groups of 4.5 students each, which is not possible with whole numbers. Therefore, we need to find the next possible whole number division, which is 6 groups of 9 students each, and then we need to form 6 more groups to make a total of 12 groups.

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental numbers for weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekday rental: 60 chairs
- Weekend rental: 100 chairs

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Total chairs rented in a week = (5 * 60 chairs) + (2 * 100 chairs) = 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 4 * 500 chairs = 2000 chairs

Finally, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2 * 2000 chairs = 4000 chairs

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs."

"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses equals \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- He sent 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen plates equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, let's account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates that are still usable:

- The number of usable glasses is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- The number of usable plates is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, let's add the usable glasses and plates together to find the total number of usable items:

- Total usable items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

The final numerical answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the trades step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, which is equivalent to 1 large button.
   - Therefore, 27 small buttons are worth 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - 10% of 30 small stickers = 0.1 * 30 = 3 small stickers.
   - These 3 small stickers remain with Lorraine.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - These 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 large buttons.
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.
   - Total large buttons = 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 47."
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we first need to calculate the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

2. Calculate the total number of hours for all the songs:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song in hours} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 9/2:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we add this amount to the $70 Jayden already had:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

"Let's denote Emma's score as \( E \) and Ava's score as \( A \).

Ava's score is calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times (E + 8) \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times (E + 3) \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \)

So, Ava's total score is:
\[ A = 10(E + 8) + 5(E + 3) + 1680 \]
\[ A = 10E + 80 + 5E + 15 + 1680 \]
\[ A = 15E + 1795 \]

Emma's score is calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points for berries: \( 5(E + 3) \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \)

So, Emma's total score is:
\[ E = 10E + 5(E + 3) + 1800 \]
\[ E = 10E + 5E + 15 + 1800 \]
\[ E = 15E + 1815 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ A - E = (15E + 1795) - (15E + 1815) \]
\[ A - E = 15E + 1795 - 15E - 1815 \]
\[ A - E = 1795 - 1815 \]

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify this equation:

\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):

\[ o = 17 - w \]

Substitute this expression for \( o \) into the second equation:

\[ 17 - w - 2w = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3w = 5 \]
\[ -3w = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3w = -12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o + w = 17 \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

   - The price of gas is $3/gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of the gas consumed in a week is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{142}

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has decided to cover half of this cost, which means the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150. Therefore, John still needs to cover the remaining half of the cost, which is $300 - $150 = $150.

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he still needs to cover:

$150 - $50 = $100.

So, John is missing $100."
"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. 

Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees, the temperature during the night will be:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, the number of groups is calculated as follows:

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"To calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds each day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply that by the number of days in the month.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

So, the money he makes in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

For a 30-day month, the total money he makes is:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$75.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work:

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours she worked, which is:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The special hourly rate for the additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, we calculate the special hourly rate:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Pay for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the pay for the additional hours to find the total pay for the day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Adding the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together, we get 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in the enclosure. 

The final numerical answer is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill:

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's starting salary:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly rate became $10.50.
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final hourly rate became $11.50.

2. **Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:**
   - At $11.50 per hour, for 20 hours, Billy earns:
     \[
     11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, let's determine Sally's starting salary.

3. **Sally's starting salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the hours played in the last week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added:

Cost of diamond = $600
Cost of gold = $300

Total cost before premium = $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost:

Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost to find out how much James paid:

Total cost paid = Total cost before premium + Premium
Total cost paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many more candies he needs to sell to have all of his candy, we subtract the number of candies he still has from the total number of candies he has:

200 (total candies he has now) - 150 (candies he has already sold) = 50.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

2. **End of January:** 10 * 2 = 20 students
3. **End of February:** 20 * 2 = 40 students
4. **End of March:** 40 * 2 = 80 students
5. **End of April:** 80 * 2 = 160 students
6. **End of May:** 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students by the end of May = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. We know that he made $105 and that each branch costs $0.25.

First, we calculate the total number of branches he climbed:
\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. Since he made this money over the course of a week (7 days), we divide the total number of branches by 7:
\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{7} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she initially picks:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each of the 4 types, so she drops:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ flowers} \]

The total number of petals of the flowers she drops is:
\[ 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals she initially picked:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they use 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows lost is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the 14 marshmallows left. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. His two friends who are significantly worse can play for half as long as Jack, which is 120 minutes each. The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 360 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends:
- Jack: 240 minutes
- Friend 1 (worse): 120 minutes
- Friend 2 (worse): 120 minutes
- Friend 3 (better): 360 minutes

Total play time = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since each game lasts 20 minutes and costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \frac{840 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 42 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to multiply the number of each type of animal by its price and then add the totals together.

For the goats:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the totals:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he should buy, we can subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

\[ 63 - (8 + 40) = 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate how many cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide $125,000 by 20:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Calculate the total time in hours.
4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time Sandy walked in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars, making the total number of cars in the parking lot 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate his daily earnings:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Each task pays $1.20.

So, the earnings per cycle are:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Now, his daily earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00/\text{day} = \$1260.00/\text{week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1260.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins.

\[
8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins of cat food}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins.

\[
6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins of dog food}
\]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

\[
88 \text{ tins of cat food} - 36 \text{ tins of dog food} = 52 \text{ tins}
\]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[
52
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:

\[
5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
\]

So, the total number of eggs Cindy has is 27."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The loss Milly will incur is the total shipping cost minus the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the loss is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21.00. However, the question asks for the amount of money Milly will lose, which in this case is $0 (as she gains $21.00).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has before making any purchases:

- Initial amount: $40
- Amount given by her father: $100

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

- Two pairs of jeans at $30 each: 2 * $30 = $60
- A bag for $20

Total cost of purchases = $60 + $20 = $80

Now, let's find out how much money Mulan has left after the purchases:

Money left = Total amount before purchases - Total cost of purchases
Money left = $140 - $80 = $60

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week production: 8,000 bars
Second week production: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week production: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

Fourth week production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final numerical answer is 14,000 bars."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{1128}{60} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks is:
\[ \boxed{18.8} \]"
"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs based on the items she needs installed.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:

- Additional mirrors: Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. At $15.00 per item, this will cost her 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
- Additional chandeliers: Angela needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier. At $15.00 per item, this will cost her 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
- Additional pictures: Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures. At $15.00 per item, this will cost her 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the additional items to the base installation cost:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional items cost: $30.00 (mirrors) + $15.00 (chandeliers) + $150.00 (pictures) = $175.00

Total cost for Angela: $129.00 + $175.00 = $304.00

The final numerical answer is $304.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

First, let's establish the total distance of the highway. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \text{Speed} \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. If the speed of a kangaroo is \( v \), then the speed of a turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

We need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. The total speed of the 4 turtles is:
\[ \text{Total speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

Since the distance remains the same, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{18v}{2v} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to cross the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to buy the laptop is $350, and she has $230, so the amount in her purse must be $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam decides to slice 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam decides to slice 5 small apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

"First, let's calculate how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows.

The farmer gets 5 liters of milk a day from each of his 3 cows. Therefore, the total amount of milk he currently gets is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows he needs, we first determine the additional amount of milk he needs to produce:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The total number of students is 20.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes. Each group takes 10 minutes, so we divide the remaining time by the time per group:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms.

Let's start with the calculations:

- Initial number of goats in Farm X: 55
- Initial number of goats in Farm Y: 45
- Number of goats sold from Farm X: 10
- Number of goats sold from Farm Y: 2 * 10 = 20

Now, let's subtract the sold goats from the initial number of goats:

- Remaining goats in Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45
- Remaining goats in Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms:

- Total remaining goats: 45 + 25 = 70

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes each year by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (12 months), he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year, so the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \frac{2640}{24} = 110 \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the discount per basket is $2.
- Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food:
- The total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
123"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote my age as \( x \). Then, my brother's age is \( x + 3 \) and my sister's age is \( x - 2 \). My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river over the three days.

1. **First Day**: The initial amount of water is 4000 gallons.
2. **Second Day**: The amount of water doubles from the first day. Therefore, the amount of water on the second day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **Third Day**: The amount of water increases by 6000 gallons from the second day. Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days is the sum of the amounts from each day:
\[
4000 \text{ gallons} + 8000 \text{ gallons} + 14000 \text{ gallons} = 26000 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, after Day 1, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

**Day 2:**
Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, after Day 2, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

**Day 3:**
Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
   \[
   1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
   \]

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year (12 months), Amber earns:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
   \]

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Wendy earns:
   \[
   3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
   \]

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
   \[
   36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars.

Given:
- The number of red cars is 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
- The total number of cars is 75.

First, calculate the number of green cars:
\[
\text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of blue cars:
\[
\text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Also, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bacon} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of bacon} + \text{Total cost of chicken} + \text{Total cost of strawberries} + \text{Total cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 196 = -131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the items. She is short by:
\[
\text{Shortage} = 196 - 65 = 131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}

"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made on each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. 

First, calculate 20% of the total microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. Therefore, the number of microphones that can fit in pairs is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that were arranged on the stage is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
- There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead, which means there are \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds flying overhead.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, which means there are \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds feeding.

Now, we can add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \( 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \).

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, each jar contained 50 / 5 = 10 cookies.

"To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.

Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Now, we calculate the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Finally, we determine the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the costs:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for her daily diet is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise:

Mark's new hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:
Total hours per week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we calculate Mark's weekly earnings:

Weekly earnings = Total hours per week * New hourly wage
Weekly earnings = 40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480/week.

The final numerical answer is $480."
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 3x \) lawns for Kamala.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 5x \) lawns for Alba.

The total number of lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( 6 \times 9x = 54x \).

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is $54x, and the earnings from lemonade sales is \( 80 - 54x \).

To find \( x \), we need to determine the value that makes \( 54x \) a reasonable amount given the context. Since \( x \) must be a whole number, let's solve for \( x \) by assuming \( x = 1 \) (the smallest possible value):

If \( x = 1 \), then the earnings from mowing lawns would be \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars. This leaves \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars for lemonade sales.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \( 26 \).

"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car. He gets $25 per hour, so:

30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from the total earnings:

$750 (total earnings) - $500 (car payment) = $250

So, the profit John makes on his car is $250."
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally did, he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. Therefore, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is 1."
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we need to first determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

Total pages Denise read: 10 + 15 = 25 pages

Daniel's reading:
- Yesterday: 13 pages
- Today: 0 pages

Total pages Daniel read: 13 + 0 = 13 pages

Now, to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

25 - 13 = 12

So, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls. This means the pot can fill 8 child's bowls (since 4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls).

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. Each person will have one bowl of soup. Therefore, 4 bowls of soup will be consumed in total.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 4 bowls are consumed, the leftover soup will be enough for:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Thus, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and since there are 2 children, each child can have:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bowls} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much William spent in total, we need to multiply the cost of the notebooks by the number of notebooks he bought and then add the cost of the ballpen.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

For the red shoe boxes, he uses 1/3 of them. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, the number of red shoe boxes he uses is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:

\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left} \]

Therefore, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:

\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the expenses and the money they spent:

1. **Cake Cost**: $11
2. **Balloons Cost**: 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost is calculated as follows:
   - Cost per 2 balloons = $0.5
   - Cost per balloon = $0.5 / 2 = $0.25
   - Cost for 12 balloons = 12 * $0.25 = $3
3. **Ice Cream Cost**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the cost is:
   - Cost for 2 tubs = 2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received:
- Each one's share = Total money / 2
- Each one's share = $28 / 2 = $14

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Adding these together:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47
\]

Thus, the total number of Larry's pets is:
\[
\boxed{47}

"Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so he can eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day. Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day. Given that the loaf of bread has 24 slices, the loaf will last \(24 \div 6 = 4\) days.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"Martha collects shells every month starting from when she was 5 years old until she turns 10 years old. 

To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in age and then convert that into months. 

Martha is 10 years old and she started at 5 years old, so she has been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since there are 12 months in a year, she has been collecting shells for \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells. 

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows, with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that each row has the same number of chamomile tea cups and the same number of mint tea cups.

Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Since there are 3 rows, the total number of chamomile tea cups is \( 3x \) and the total number of mint tea cups is also \( 3x \). The total number of cups of tea is the sum of the chamomile tea cups, the mint tea cups, and the cinnamon tea cups. We know that the total number of cups is 27, and she brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the equation for the total number of cups is:

\[ 3x + 3x + 15 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 6x + 15 = 27 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 12 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, there are 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea in each row. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. 

Next, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. We do this by dividing the total time available by the time it takes for one trip:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on popcorn and candy:
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub, and he had 2 tubs: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- Candy costs $2 per box, and he had 4 boxes: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Total spent on popcorn and candy: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Now, let's subtract this amount from his monthly allowance:
- Colby's monthly allowance is $150.
- Money left after buying popcorn and candy: \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. We know that tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, and tickets for other days cost $7 each. Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, he can only see Friday or Saturday movies, which cost $10 each.

To find out how many movies he can see, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
- Number of movies he can see: \(126 \div 10 = 12.6\).

Since Colby can only see whole movies, we take the integer part of the division:
- Number of movies he can see: \(12\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
12"
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories from all the pastries:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40000 + 45000 = 85000

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

The total number of other toys Sophie has is:
- 31 building blocks
- 8 stuffed animals
- 9 stacking rings

So, the total number of these toys is:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie's nephew has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
62 - 48 = 14

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Q + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Q = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Q + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total number of water balloons at the start was \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(9 + 15 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is 24."

Next, we need to determine how many tables they can fit with 60 boxes, given that they can fit 2 boxes per table:

- Number of tables they can fit: \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:

- Number of new tables needed: \(30 - 15 = 15\) tables

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Therefore, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 12-hour and the 24-hour options, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost under the 12-hour option:
- The initial cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 12 hours, so there are no additional hours to pay for.

The total cost under the 12-hour option is 1000 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost under the 24-hour option:
- The initial cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 12 hours initially, and then he adds 70 pesos for every additional hour. Since he stays for 24 hours in total, the number of additional hours is 24 - 12 = 12 hours.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours is 12 * 70 = 840 pesos.

The total cost under the 24-hour option is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The difference is 2440 - 1000 = 1440 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 1440 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option over the 24-hour option."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining distance}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission for the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission for the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each page is printed on both sides of the paper, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ 150 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 150 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate the total number of reports he stapled.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of this sleepwalking period is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before this (from 6:00 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.) is:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5:55 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 24 cups. According to the problem, Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to first determine Shawna's age and then use that to find her father's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

First, we calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Next, we subtract this value from the number reported by Courtney to find the actual number of attendees:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and considering the context of a concert where fractional people are not possible, we round to the nearest whole number. In this case, 38.4 rounds to 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. 

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). 

Now we can calculate the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

Adding these together, the total number of balls is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but then they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in 2 holes:
\[29 - 2 = 27\]

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so four times this number is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 27 = 13\]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number Amora and Lainey received, we can write:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We add the number of corn chips each person received:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the cost of travel, we first need to calculate 50% of the cost of supplies. The cost of supplies is $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

The total cost of travel is 50% more than the cost of supplies, which means we add the 50% to the original cost of supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. Let's verify the solution:

- Adelwolfe caught \( A = 40 \) Pokemon.
- Stan caught \( S = 147 \) Pokemon.
- Alex caught \( X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152 \) Pokemon.

Summing these up:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode. It is also stated that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we can write:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes. To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the number of minutes per episode:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[
\boxed{446}

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \(0.75 \times 8 = 6\) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:

12 boxes

Next, we determine how many boxes she gave away:

- She gave 2 boxes to her mom.
- She gave 2 boxes to her sister.

So, the total number of boxes given away is:

2 + 2 = 4 boxes

Now, we calculate the number of boxes she kept:

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes that is:

1/4 of 12 boxes = 3 boxes

Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:

The final numerical answer is 180 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
India has 4 more than this number = 25 + 4 = 29 states

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:

Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."

"To find the cost of the red car, we calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car.

Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's dad's current age as \( D \) and his brother's current age as \( B \).

First, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, the difference in age between Emil and his dad will be \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years. At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. So we can write the equation:

\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

To find \( D \), we solve the equation:

\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So we can write the equation:

\[ 24 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:

\[ 24 = 2B \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:

\[ 43 + 12 = 55 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we'll add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the total number of students who will leave early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders/band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size five and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, we have the sizes of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots: 25 and 5, respectively. To find the average size, we add these sizes together and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ new plants} \]

Each new plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many, so:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel intake} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 3 \text{ petunias/basket} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{sweet potato vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is:
- \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
- \(3\) roses.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to sauté to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change in the room during each phase of the air conditioner's operation and then determine the final temperature relative to the starting temperature.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - No change in temperature
   - Temperature change: \(0 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 0 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total temperature change: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} + 0 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the room was initially at a certain temperature and the air conditioner reduced the temperature by 18 degrees, the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time as 30 years. According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time at the age of \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years.

Since the comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Thus, Bill saw the comet for the first time at the age of \(90 - 75 = 15\) years.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:

\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \), and the number of flights to France and Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) each.

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88. \]

Now, we can determine the number of flights to France. Since the first plane makes 88 flights in a day, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   \[
   \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   \[
   \text{Combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Therefore, Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration of all three wolves:**
   \[
   \text{Total howl duration} = \text{Tobias' howl duration} + \text{Chikote's howl duration} + \text{Igneous's howl duration}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}

5. **Convert the total duration from seconds to minutes:**
   \[
   120 \text{ seconds} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total amount he needed minus the money given by his parents, which is $30 - $18 = $12.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[A + B + H + W = 20\]
Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
This simplifies to:
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
So,
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[\frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]
According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]
Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
So,
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[\boxed{3}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 that Walter's friend is going to give:

Total amount from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000
Amount from friend: $200

Total amount collected so far including friend's contribution: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected so far:

Amount donated by lawyer: 3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice in relation to the others.

Let's denote the total number of slices as \( S \). Since the watermelon is divided among 6 people, we can assume that the slices are distributed evenly among them. Let's say each slice is of size \( x \). Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 6x \).

According to the problem, each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Then, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total size of the watermelon can be expressed as:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

However, we know the total size of the watermelon is \( 6x \). This indicates that the slices are not distributed as described in the problem, but rather the problem is asking for the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets based on the given condition.

Each adult gets \( 2x \) slices, and the total number of slices is \( 6x \). Therefore, the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{6x} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find the percentage, we convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33.33\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \boxed{33.33} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds from minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start making the cake, we subtract the total time required from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are \( 8 \) chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, as well as the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost of renting the studio: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, and assuming a month has 4 weeks, the number of sessions per month is:
- Sessions per week: 3
- Weeks per month: 4
- Total sessions per month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total sessions per month: 12
- Total earnings per month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the first equation by 4:
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the second equation by 7:
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water the pool company needs to fill the pool:

\[ \text{Total gallons needed} = 10472 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Total gallons needed} = 62,072.8 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 62,072.8 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 6,207.28 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $6,207.28."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Given that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Matteo}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Shandy}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped into the tank from the tank's total capacity to find out how many gallons are remaining:

- Remaining gallons: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.658 \times 0.817 = 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x \times 0.534 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.4%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits, he will have:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \]

She gave these 13 packs equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

\[ \frac{13}{10} = 1.3 \]

Each friend received 1.3 pieces of sweets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1.3 \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase annually to the initial price of $120.

First, calculate the price after the first year:
\[ \text{Price after 1st year} = 120 + (120 \times 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 \]

Next, calculate the price after the second year:
\[ \text{Price after 2nd year} = \text{Price after 1st year} \times 1.05 = 120 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]

Finally, calculate the price after the third year:
\[ \text{Price after 3rd year} = \text{Price after 2nd year} \times 1.05 = 120 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]

Let's calculate the final price after three years:
\[ 120 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:
\[ \text{Final price} = 139 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 139 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. 

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. 

Since the same number of pictures were put into each album, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. 

Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

For selfies:
\[
3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
\]

For portraits:
\[
2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
\]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits combined is:

\[
27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
\text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times 3.3333 = 60 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:

   \]

3. **Percentage of average and difficult questions:**
   \[
   100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]
   Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
   \[
   \text{Average questions} = \text{Difficult questions} = \frac{60\%}{2} = 30\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ questions}

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. According to the problem, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 + 0.5 \times 12 = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes. If one dwarf can mine 18 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves can mine:
\[ 40 \times 18 = 720 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Finally, we find out how much ore they can mine in a month with 30 days. If 40 dwarves can mine 720 pounds of ore per day, then in 30 days they can mine:
\[ 720 \times 30 = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21600} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[
\text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times 0.40 = 10
\]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[
\text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times 0.50 = 6
\]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons.

\[
\text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

The combined probability of not having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is the sum of the probabilities of not getting an extension and not convincing the teacher:
\[ 60\% + 80\% = 140\% \]
However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to correct this by recognizing that the 140% is the combined probability of the two mutually exclusive events (not getting an extension or not convincing the teacher). Therefore, the probability of not having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is 100% (since the events are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities).

Thus, the probability of not having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is 0% (since the extension or convincing the teacher covers all possibilities).

So, the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the probability of the substitute teacher scenario plus the probability of the normal teacher scenario where he has to turn in the homework:
\[ 50\% + 0\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This includes the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats available = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total tickets to be distributed = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty
Total tickets to be distributed = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, we need to split these 1250 tickets equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are \( G \) graduates. The number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Total tickets to be distributed}}{G} = \frac{1250}{G} \]

However, the question does not specify the number of graduates, so we can only express the answer in terms of \( G \). If we assume the number of graduates is known or can be determined, we can substitute \( G \) with that number to get the exact number of tickets per graduate.

Since the number of graduates is not provided, the final numerical answer in terms of \( G \) is:

\[ \frac{1250}{G} \]

If we assume the number of graduates is 950 (as a common assumption in such problems if not specified), then:

\[ \frac{1250}{950} = \frac{25}{19} \approx 1.3158 \]

So, each graduate would receive approximately 1.3158 tickets. However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer and does not specify the number of graduates, the answer in terms of \( G \) is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{1250}{G}} \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, let's add the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. After buying the cheese, the amount of money she will have left is:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During his college years, Jim would have earned $0 because he was not working.
- Total income during college = $0.

Finally, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the total amount borrowed:
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $100,000.
- Total amount borrowed = $200,000.
- Net income if he had not gone to college = $100,000 - $200,000 = -$100,000.

Since Jim would have a negative net income, it would take him 4 years to earn back the $200,000 he borrowed, as he would need to earn $200,000 to cover the debt.

Therefore, the time it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school is 4 years."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. **Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:**
   - Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
   - Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

2. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area = Length × Width
   - Area = \( 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \)

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

3. **Calculate the total area of fabric needed:**
   - Total area = \( 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \)

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered over the three days:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3

Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.1667}
\]"
"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 = 130000 \]

So, the total population in South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked in total. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each day they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Therefore, the total number of days worked by each painter is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \]

To convert this into hours, we know that 1 day is equal to 24 hours. So, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours} = \frac{1512}{8} \text{ hours} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 189 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = \$20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^2 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, substituting the initial price \( P_0 = \$20000 \) into the equation for \( P_3 \):
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.627441 \]

Therefore:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.627441 = 12548.82 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{12548.82} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the 50 books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
20

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate how far she has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

Now, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance to New York City:

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance Bernice has already driven: 325 kilometers

Distance still needed to drive: 1955 - 325 = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days, and then convert that into gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups into gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train accordingly.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people after boarding} = 90 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 190 - 80 = 110

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to determine how many tiles are required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the additional cost as follows:

\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
  \]

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
\[
2 \text{ loads (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ load (king size bed)} = 3 \text{ loads}
\]

Since Greg does this every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
\[
52 \text{ weeks in a year}

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time taken for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit itself and then add the cost of the cast and the painkillers.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. The cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. The cost for parking is:

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches she had after the new order was:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

First, we calculate the total number of trucks dispatched for delivery:
\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \]

Next, we determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks is:
\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- Dennis can buy 2 pounds of butter and get 1 pound of butter for half price.
- He can repeat this process 3 times to get 6 pounds of butter.

For each cycle of 2 pounds:
- Dennis pays full price for 1 pound.
- Dennis pays half price for 1 pound.

The cost for 1 pound of butter is $4.00.

For each cycle:
- Cost for 1 pound at full price: $4.00
- Cost for 1 pound at half price: \( \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \)

Total cost for 2 pounds:
- \( 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \)

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter:
- He can repeat this cycle 3 times.
- Total cost for 6 pounds:
- \( 3 \times 6.00 = 18.00 \)

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{18.00}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come: 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest beyond 20. Therefore, the additional guests are:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Cost for additional guests: 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost of the party:

- Total cost: $125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's calculate the amount of money Maggie and Riza spent and then determine how much they have left.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent $60 / 4 = $15. Therefore, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent $60 / 3 = $20. Therefore, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Adding the amounts left with Maggie and Riza, we get $45 + $40 = $85.

The final numerical answer is $85."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, Jenny needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. She will use the $25 she has and the change from the $5 bills to make up the $5 difference. This means she will receive $5 in change.

Now, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive as change. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she will receive is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling burger platters:
9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00

Then, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling sodas:
20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, let's add up all the totals:
$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
85"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The discount percentage is calculated based on the original price of the watch.
\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Discount Percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.

2. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per spring per hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one jellyfish is created every second, in one hour, one spring creates \( 3600 \) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per spring per 4 hours:**
   - In 4 hours, one spring creates \( 4 \times 3600 = 14400 \) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \( 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so \( B = 90 \).

Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. This can be written as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then determine the time it took him based on his walking speed.

James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 2 + 2 = 4 miles.

Given that he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 4 miles can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

Thus, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour day, the farmer will make:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour day, the truck will pick up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

The total number of bales made minus the total number of bales picked up gives us the number of bales left in the field:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[ 12 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in class and the additional time he spends learning on weekends.

First, let's determine the number of periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the time spent in class each day is:
\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the time spent in class each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Therefore, the time spent on weekends is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the time spent on weekends:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{85}{3}} \]"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball reaches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce. Thus, the height on the second bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means:

\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

First, let's determine the speed of each train:
- The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- The first train travels \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- The second train travels \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then determine how many people he helps.

Billy works 3 hours a day and can help 2 people per hour. Therefore, he can help \(3 \times 2 = 6\) people per day.

The period from March 1st to April 19th includes 31 days in March and 19 days in April, totaling \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days. The number of days he works is \(50 \times 0.8 = 40\) days.

Since he helps 6 people per day, the total number of people he helps is \(40 \times 6 = 240\).

The final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:

20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and cars to find the total number of people who were not inside the church:

420 people (buses) + 60 people (cars) = 480 people

Therefore, the number of people who were inside the church is:

100 - 480 = -380

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the number of people inside the church cannot be negative. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question. The total number of people who attended the ceremony (including those inside the church) should be the sum of those in the cars and buses. If we assume the question is asking for the number of people who were not inside the church, the answer is 480. If the question is asking for the number of people inside the church, it would need more information, such as the total number of attendees."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Martha's age:**
   - Mike is 24 years old.
   - Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
   - Therefore, Martha's age is \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) years.

2. **Determine Jeff's age:**
   - Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   - Since Martha is 20 years old, Jeff's age is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) years.

Thus, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on these activities in a single day.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch break and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each per day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks per day:
- 15 minutes break + 15 minutes break = 30 minutes
- 30 minutes break + 30 minutes lunch = 60 minutes

So, Bobby spends 60 minutes per day on his lunch and breaks.

Now, to find out how many hours this is:
- 60 minutes = 1 hour

Since this is the total time spent on lunch and breaks per day, we need to multiply this by the number of days (5 days) to find the total time spent over 5 days:
- 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. Therefore, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of the frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Total cost of the frying pan and the set of towels: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
6. New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( x \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, which is equal to \( \frac{x}{15} \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Chris is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and the percentage of her salary she plans to live on in retirement.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = $20,000 \).

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement:
- Her retirement income will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = $40,000 \) per year.

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:
- Total amount needed for retirement = \( 40,000 \times 20 = $800,000 \).

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- Lauren saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Thus, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cut parts is 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \).

Given that 40% of \( N \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ N = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil, and then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
The coupon discount is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the coupon discount from the total:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the mean of the heights of the heels worn by the women at the party. 

Given:
- Three women are wearing 4 inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2 inch heels.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height from the 4 inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Total height from the 2 inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we find the combined total height of all heels:
- Combined total height: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Then, we determine the number of heels:
- Total number of heels: \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:
- Average height: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in June and the total number of days she will be on vacation.

June has 30 days, and Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month. She plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Let's calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike in June:

\[ \text{Total miles planned} = 2 \times 125 \times 30 = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since she plans to hike 7500 miles and she needs to hike 9300 miles, we can see that she needs to hike an additional:

\[ 9300 - 7500 = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to cover the additional 1800 miles in June. Since there are 30 days in June, we divide the additional miles by the number of days:

\[ \text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples bought by Pierre, Paul, and Jacques is 12 kg. Therefore, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

1. Start with the initial amount of money Raymond had: $21.
2. Add the amount he saved from his allowance: $21 + $11 = $32.
3. Subtract the amount he spent on the comic book: $32 - $5 = $27.
4. Subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle: $27 - $19 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each book cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases.
2. Calculate the total amount spent on the books.
3. Divide the total amount spent on the books by the number of books bought.

First, Anna started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna spent $4 on other items before buying the books. So, the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year's enrollment was 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. Adding this increase to last year's enrollment gives us the current enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after his purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

He buys:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's add the new purchases to the initial counts:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes:
- Difference: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia's chore was mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's chore. Therefore, Megan's time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's chore. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]
(Note: ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 4 hours, but since the problem specifies 8 hours, we use this value.)

Now, we sum the time each person took to complete their chores:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time:**
   John drives for 2 hours one way.

2. **Determine the speed:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is:
\[12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

However, we calculated that the first 4 workers produced only 200 toys in 10 hours. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys needed to reach the total of 400 toys. The number of toys the fifth worker produced is:
\[400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

Since the fifth worker also works for a 10-hour shift, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is:
\[\frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{20}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he kept, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \).

Solving for \( S \):
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces:

- An ounce of M&M has 30 M&Ms.
- Therefore, 30 ounces will have \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&Ms.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag:

- If each small bag contains 10 M&Ms, then the number of small bags he can make is \(900 \div 10 = 90\).

So, the final numerical answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first determine the speed of the second fastest car and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the second fastest car is:
   \[
   5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
   \[
   1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

The final numerical answer is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, if Vince's age two years ago was \( x \), then:

\[ 14 = 2x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) (since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is \( S + (S + 12) = 2S + 12 \).

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of each box (which contains 8 crayons and weighs 8 ounces) is:

\[ \text{Total weight of each box} = 8 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 8 \text{ ounces (box)} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the boxes. Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 16 \text{ ounces/box} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Since she walks at a certain speed on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:
\[ v \times 40 = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]
The time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time for the entire 3-mile walk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can add up the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Adding these together: \(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. After pouring, the temperature of the water in his bottle from the second mug is \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce is poured from the 5-ounce mug).

The final temperature of the water in Donny's bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. Since he poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the \( T \)-degree mug, the final temperature \( F \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ F = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + T}{5} \]

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need to find the minimum temperature \( T \) such that the final temperature \( F \) is at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5 gives:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives:

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, given the initial number of animals and the daily additions.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over the 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over the 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added over the 21 days:
\[ \text{Initial cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To find out the cost of each single bagel after Russell orders 4 packs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Applying the 10% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted total cost} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

1 less than 3 scoops is:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

3 less than 6 potatoes is:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of scoops to potatoes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ scoops}}{3 \text{ potatoes}} = \frac{18 \text{ scoops}}{x \text{ potatoes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{18 \times 3}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - 17 - 34 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects from all his trees over a period of 10 years.

First, we know that Tim grows 5 trees and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. So, the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year is 6. Therefore, the number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in one year is:

\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade (10 years). We multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by 10:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to first determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 252 \]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the probabilities for each ticket:
- The probability that the first ticket is a winner is given as 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket is a winner is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), we multiply the probabilities of each event occurring.

The probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. Therefore, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from the number of seashells Jim collected:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person got \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19 \frac{2}{3}} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price of one mobile device. Linus sells each device for twice the original price, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
The total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Since he sold each of the 6 devices for $40, the total revenue is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of one person, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
- For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Next, we determine how many more bottles are needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed: \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to 1 for practical purposes)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
- Number of babies wearing bows and purple: 2
- Total number of babies wearing bows: 3

The percentage chance is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 = 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043

"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham initially owned. He owns 80 square meters of unused land.

He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

The price per square meter for the first sale is:
\[ \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

The price per square meter for the second sale is:
\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from the first two sales:
\[ 40 \text{ square meters} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} + 20 \text{ square meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]
\[ = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining land after the first two sales is:

"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - For each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}\).

3. **Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days:**
   - For 2 days, he uses \(2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ face masks/day} = 12 \text{ face masks}\).

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. 

Lamar found 5 eggs.

Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found by all of them is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:

- The first complex has 200 apartments.
- The second complex also has 200 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

So, the third complex has:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \]

Now, we add the number of apartments in all three complexes:
\[ 400 + 640 = 1040 \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of garbage collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1248 \]"
"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

\[
\boxed{2350}

"Jack originally had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. Therefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is \( y - 7 \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4(y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4(y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, so we can write:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

This means Rissa received $15. Ronnie received $5. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister. So, the amount left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the total area of the house is the sum of the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house. The remaining area is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[
20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Since the chalk started at 5 inches, the amount of chalk used is:

\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

This means the teacher has:

\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

of chalk left. Now, the teacher will use 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days he can continue using the chalk before it reaches 2 inches, at which point he will have to recycle it.

Let's denote the amount of chalk left after \( n \) days as \( C_n \). The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk, so:

\[ C_{n+1} = C_n - 0.2 \times C_n = 0.8 \times C_n \]

We start with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches. We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches. We can express \( C_n \) as:

\[ C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \]

We need to solve for \( n \) in the inequality:

\[ 2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2 \]

Dividing both sides by 2.75:

\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{20}{27.5} = \frac{4}{5.5} = \frac{8}{11} \]

Now, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( (0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11} \). We can do this by calculating successive powers of 0.8:

\[ (0.8)^1 = 0.8 \]
\[ (0.8)^2 = 0.64 \]
\[ (0.8)^3 = 0.512 \]
\[ (0.8)^4 = 0.4096 \]
\[ (0.8)^5 = 0.32768 \]
\[ (0.8)^6 = 0.262144 \]
\[ (0.8)^7 = 0.2097152 \]
\[ (0.8)^8 = 0.16777216 \]

We see that \( (0.8)^6 = 0.262144 \) is less than \( \frac{8}{11} \approx 0.72727 \), but \( (0.8)^5 = 0.32768 \) is greater than \( \frac{8}{11} \). Therefore, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is 6.

So, the teacher has 6 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

The number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students} = 17 \text{ students} \]

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to calculate how many masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. Then we can use this information to find out how many masks Johnny bought.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Johnny's masks} = 3 \times \text{Mike's masks} + 2 \]

Given that Mike bought 5 masks, we substitute 5 for Mike's masks:

\[ \text{Johnny's masks} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Johnny's masks} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Johnny's masks} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

James has 30 teeth in total.

The dentist drills 4 teeth.
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk sold.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that was returned.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased.
\[
\text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is based on the cost of the returned milk.
\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the refund amount is:
\[

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can calculate Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old. Checking the second condition:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to satisfy her friends' consumption, and both require 3 pizzas each, she needs to buy:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had 12 bandages left (50 - 38 = 12).
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have 12 + 50 = 62 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had 62 - 28 = 34 bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have 34 - 28 = 6 bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had 6 + 100 - 25 = 81 bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have started with 81 - 78 = 3 bandages on the third day.

Now, let's calculate how many bandages they started with on the first day. We know they had 62 bandages at the end of the first day, and they ordered 50 more on the first day. So, they must have started with 62 - 50 + 38 = 45 bandages on the first day.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the haircut was 2 inches long. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the cost for the haircut is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30 \text{ per inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and the color is:

\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an attendance bonus of $10 for each week she has complete attendance. Since she did not miss any days in April, she receives the bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40 \]

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$40 = \$310 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$310 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

For doing laundry:
- Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each laundry.
- So, he earned $3.00.

For cleaning his room:
- Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each cleaning.
- So, he earned $1.50.

For taking the trash out:
- Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each trip.
- So, he earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

For emptying the dishwasher:
- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time.
- So, he earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
- $3.00 (from laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning his room) + $1.50 (from taking the trash) + $3.00 (from emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00.

Therefore, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered the restaurant.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered the restaurant.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spends in total:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was left after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:

- On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons.
- On the second day, his children drank 4 gallons, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
- On the third day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
- On the fourth day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3 \text{ people}} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons per person} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons} \]

To express this as a decimal, it is approximately 2.67 gallons."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes.

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we have:
\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This is the total number of fish minus the number of fish with red stripes:
\[
\text{Number of fish without red stripes} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish (those without red stripes) have blue stripes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes:
\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. So, Amy loses four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up three colors, which means she loses three colors:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The roof of the house is the total height of the house, which is 420 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = 420 - 240 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many shells each team found. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of shells**: 700
2. **Team Alphas found 40% of the shells**:

   \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
   \]
3. **Remaining shells after Team Alphas**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
   \]
4. **Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells**:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]
5. **Remaining shells after Team The finders**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 420 - 252 = 168
   \]
6. **Team Gogetters found the remaining shells**:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the average distance walked per day by all the dogs.

The total distance walked by the first three dogs is:
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles

The average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance walked by all four dogs is:
4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, let's calculate the amount John gets as a loan. His house is worth $250,000 and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:

\[ \text{Leftover money} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Therefore, the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed over the specified periods:

- For the low setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the low setting is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) liters.
- For the medium setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) liters.
- For the high setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the high setting is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) liters.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits over the 8 years.

First, we calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it has increased by 150%. The increase in cost is calculated as follows:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \]
So, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of visits over the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, the cost for one year is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]
Over 5 years, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit remains $5, and she continues to visit 3 times a year. The cost for these 3 years is:
\[ 5 \times 3 \times 3 = 45 \]

Adding the costs from both periods, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of the 36-minute call:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is \$8.00."
"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we first need to calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday and then add 1 inch to that amount.

Given that it rained 2 inches on Monday, we can calculate the expected rain for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Rain on Monday} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times 2 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 5 \]

So, the number of inches of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify this by calculating the number of brownies:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This matches the requirement that there are 10 treats in total. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these two costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional charges:

\[
35 + 40 = 75
\]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if both services are purchased together. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[
0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price:

\[
75 - 15 = 60
\]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art service costs $3:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the services:

\[
60 + 30 = 90
\]

Thus, Karen would pay a total of:

\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine Susan receives is counted as one magazine, the total number of magazines she gets every year is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ K = 27 + 4 \]

\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will calculate the price step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

2. **Price Increase in December:**
   The price increased by 80% in December. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January:**
   The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for veteran lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
- Standard rate per lesson: $80
- Number of standard rate lessons: 4
- Total earnings from standard rate lessons: \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the 2 lessons with veterans:
- Reduced rate per lesson (25% off the standard rate): \( 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \) dollars
- Number of veteran lessons: 2
- Total earnings from veteran lessons: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
- Total earnings: \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is 440 dollars."

   \]

2. **Calculate the sum**:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \( 70 \)."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples remaining is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels:

\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is 60%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. 

Next, her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Now, we add the grapes Madeline ate and the grapes her brother used:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes Madeline ate, the grapes her brother used, and the grapes used for the pies:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate it:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9 = 79 + 9 = 88

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- Cost of pasta: $1.00
- Cost of cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Cost of gruyere cheese: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Total weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Total hours spent cleaning}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculations. The total time spent cleaning is 20 hours, and the total workday is 8 hours. The correct percentage should be:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

But since the custodian can only work 8 hours a day, the actual percentage of the day spent cleaning is:

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 100\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100\% \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf.

1. Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we sum the capacities of all the shelves:
\[10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[110 \div 55 = 2\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell. Since she sells 3 eggs for $1, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

Number of sets = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Finally, let's calculate her total revenue from selling the eggs. Since she sells each set of 3 eggs for $1:

Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

To find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since the bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey gets 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass both tests. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of these 110 questions:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \):

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for the people) + 16 (for the rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.
- Therefore, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:
- Total number of flashlights = 20
- Total number of candles = 36
- Total number of flashlights and candles = 20 + 36 = 56

The final numerical answer is 56."

"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants:
\[ 20 \text{ plants} - 12 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants} \]

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming separately, and then sum these times.

First, we note that the total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part of the journey:

- Distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time spent hopping on land. Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time spent hopping is:

\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the time spent swimming in water. Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time spent swimming is:

\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we sum the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming to find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home:

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the cost for Bob to buy the popsicle sticks, we first need to calculate how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs. Since each box contains 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs \( 2x \).

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ \text{Cost of main phone} + \text{Cost of four additional phones} = 20 + 4 \times 10 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"
"To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos uploaded per day.
2. Determine the number of days required to upload all the photos.

First, we know that Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the number of photos uploaded per day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we first need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

The weekly cost for Alicia's clothes is calculated as follows:
- Cost for 5 blouses: \(5 \times 5.00 = 25.00\)
- Cost for 1 skirt: \(1 \times 6.00 = 6.00\)
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: \(2 \times 8.00 = 16.00\)

Adding these together gives the weekly cost:
\[25.00 + 6.00 + 16.00 = 47.00\]

Now, to find the cost over 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[47.00 \times 5 = 235.00\]

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

\[ \text{Total Words} = 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time in minutes is given by the total number of words divided by the speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which means he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, which means he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days:
\[50 + 70 + 140 = 260\]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day for the entire week (7 days) is 60. Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw over the week is:
\[60 \times 7 = 420\]

Since we already know the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 260, the total number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days combined is:
\[420 - 260 = 160\]

Since the number of people Conor saw each day for the rest of the week is the same, the number of people he saw each day on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is:
\[160 \div 3 = \frac{160}{3}\]

However, we don't need to calculate the exact number for each of the last three days to find the total for the week. We already know the total for the week is 420.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[
\boxed{420}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the initial rate, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves the previous rate, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of them is:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the initial total, we get:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we will first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required and then figure out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade.

1. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - For each gallon, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \( 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means he wants 2 cups of lemon juice (since 1 cup is needed for 1 gallon).

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed for all lemonade:**
   - Tim needs 4 cups for the regular lemonade.
   - He needs 2 cups for the extra tart lemonade.
   - Therefore, the total lemon juice needed is \( 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons are needed to get 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of lemon juice, Tim needs \( 6 \text{ lemons} \times 6 = 36 \text{ lemons} \).

Thus, the number of lemons Tim will need is 36."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to find out how much food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume per day, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day \(\times\) 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Thus, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then determine the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."

6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet per large t-shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage from each type of t-shirt:
33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pens Timothy has.
2. Use the number of pens Timothy has to find out how many pens Sarah has.

First, we know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pens George has} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

So, Sarah has 27 pens. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, Anne's height is:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her height before the summer was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \]"
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's determine the number of bars produced in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ days} \]

The company produces 5000 bars per day, so in 14 days, the company will produce:
\[ 5000 \times 14 = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars. The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \times 2 = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% off, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.4 = $16.

So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:

\[ \text{Ryan's allowance} = 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so a total of 4 ice cream cones:

\[ \text{Cost of ice cream cones} = 4 \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ \text{Money left} = 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \text{Number of movie tickets} = \left\lfloor \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in total, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate Ellen's total spending:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
- Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Next, let's calculate Lani's total spending:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so $100 * 2 = $200
- Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals to find the overall amount spent:
- Total spent: $105 + $230 = $335

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{335}

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: 
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.

2. **Dimes**: 
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

3. **Nickels**: 
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.

4. **Pennies**: 
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
- Total value = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00.

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given to her:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To calculate how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to determine how many days he works in a week and then calculate his earnings based on the number of cars he services and his daily pay.

First, let's determine the number of days Josh works in a week:
- He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- He does not work on 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday).
- Therefore, he works on \(7 - 2 = 5\) days a week.

Next, we calculate his earnings for one day:
- He services 3 cars a day.
- He gets paid $4 per car.
- Therefore, his daily earnings are \(3 \text{ cars/day} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$12/\text{day}\).

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- He works 5 days a week.
- His daily earnings are $12.
- Therefore, his weekly earnings are \(5 \text{ days/week} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$60/\text{week}\).

Finally, we calculate his earnings for 2 weeks:
- His weekly earnings are $60.
- Therefore, his earnings for 2 weeks are \(2 \text{ weeks} \times \$60/\text{week} = \$120\).

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time and then determine how long it takes to fill them all.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug by the dog = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day at night. The net change in the number of holes per day is:
- Net change per day = 6 holes dug - 9 holes filled = -3 holes.

This means that every day, the number of holes decreases by 3. We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes.

Let's denote the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes as \( d \). The total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is:
- Total holes filled = 9 holes/day * \( d \) days.

Since the net change in the number of holes per day is -3, the total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is also equal to the total number of holes dug minus the total number of holes filled:
- 84 holes = 6 holes/day * 14 days - 9 holes/day * \( d \) days.

Simplifying the equation:
- 84 = 84 - 9d
- 0 = -9d
- 9d = 84
- d = 84 / 9
- d = 9.33 days.

Since we need to find out how many weeks it takes, we convert 9.33 days into weeks:
- 9.33 days / 7 days/week = 1.33 weeks.

Therefore, it takes Nate approximately 1.33 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

1.33"

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

First, let's find out how many legs there are in total. Since James is putting together 4 tables and each table has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many screws are required for all the legs. Since each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:

"First, let's determine how much money each girl raised individually.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each girl to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700

Adding these amounts together:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Time Aaron took}}{\text{Aaron's speed}} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{A} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( A = 2V \), we can substitute \( A \) with \( 2V \):

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2V} = \frac{8 \text{ minutes}}{V} \]

We know that the distance Aaron ran is the same as the distance Vanessa ran, which is 4 miles. Therefore:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ minutes}}{V} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{8 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ miles}} = 2 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we need to find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa's speed is \( V = 2 \) minutes per mile, the time she took to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ minutes per mile} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 8 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The dock is 200 feet long.
- He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Therefore, the total line required for the dock is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line required:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Thus, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"

- Cost of 2 meals: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of 1 bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per night: $10 + $5 = $15

Now, we know that the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and they make $15 in profit per night. So, the total revenue per night is $15.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue for the week is:
- $15 per night * 2 nights = $30

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $30."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we calculate the profit per watermelon and add it to the cost per watermelon:

\[
\text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 9 years old.
3. Therefore, James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
4. James is 18 years old, and he is 3 years older than Dora, so he is 3 years older than his sister Dora.
5. John had James when he was 19, so John is now 19 + 18 = 37 years old.
6. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is now 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
7. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $400 (since 100% - 80% = 20%):
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the discounted price of the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the cost for the mechanic's labor is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

Thus, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{470} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. Let's confirm this by checking the total number of legs:
- Chickens: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Cows: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Total: \( 10 + 60 = 70 \) legs

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
