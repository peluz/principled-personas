"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet's ducks lay per day. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet eats for breakfast. She eats 3 eggs per day. 

So, the number of eggs left after Janet eats for breakfast is:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Janet then bakes muffins with 4 eggs per day. Therefore, the number of eggs left after baking muffins is:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market. Janet sells each egg for $2. Thus, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required for the robe. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Given that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts required:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value due to the 150% increase.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh invests $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The house's value increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the initial value of the house:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the initial value of the house gives the new value:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh sells the house for $200,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for all sprints:**
   James runs 180 meters in one week for one sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens. She gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. 

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. 
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

First, we calculate the total feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, for 20 chickens, the total feed required per day is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

We subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total daily requirement)} - 40 \text{ cups (morning and afternoon)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we will add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart: 60 minutes

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - (3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours) = 4 hours - 5.5 hours = -1.5 hours.
   - Since the time remaining is negative, it means he has already completed the journey.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, let's sum up the distances:
- Distance from the first segment: 180 miles.
- Distance from the third segment: 15 miles.
- Distance from the fourth segment: 120 miles.

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
315 miles"
"Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours (which are 5 hours in this case), she receives 1.2 times her regular rate:

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding her regular earnings and her overtime earnings gives her total earnings for the week:

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{First month downloads} = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month. The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month is 70% of the number of downloads in the second month (since it reduced by 30%):
\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads over the three months:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**

   - Total cost for donuts: \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \)

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Number of dozens: 2
   - Cost per dozen: $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \)

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Number of dozens: 6
   - Cost per dozen: $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \)

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the pastries:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 93 = -82.5\) dollars.

Since the net profit is negative every year, Carlos will never start earning money from the lemon tree. The tree will always incur a loss.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{never}}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Contemporary Dance Enrollment:**
   - 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
   - \(20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4\) students.

2. **Remaining Students After Contemporary Dance:**
   - \(20 - 4 = 16\) students remain.

3. **Jazz Dance Enrollment:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.
   - \(25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4\) students.

4. **Remaining Students After Jazz Dance:**
   - \(16 - 4 = 12\) students remain.

5. **Hip-Hop Dance Enrollment:**
   - The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
   - Therefore, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

6. **Percentage of Students Enrolled in Hip-Hop Dance:**
   - To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:
   - \(\frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\%\).

Thus, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine the profit the merchant would make by choosing between the two purchase plans, we need to calculate the value of each item after the market increase and then find the difference between the two values.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000

First, the trains travel westward for 80 miles.
Then, they travel northwards for 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Finally, her total annual salary is the sum of her annual earnings from teaching and coaching:
\[ \$35,000/\text{year} + \$22,500/\text{year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is \$57,500."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks and then convert that into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire uses in one day:
- Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, Claire uses \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \).

Now, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, Claire uses \( 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- So, \( 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:
12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles.

Let's denote the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles as \( v \) miles per hour. The time taken to walk the remaining 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{6}{v} \text{ hours}. \]

The total time spent hiking is the sum of the time already spent and the time for the remaining distance:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{6}{v} \text{ hours}. \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours} + \frac{6}{v} \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}. \]

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} = 4. \]

To solve for \( v \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 2 + \frac{6}{v} \):
\[ 12 = 4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right). \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ 3 = 2 + \frac{6}{v}. \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 1 = \frac{6}{v}. \]

Finally, solve for \( v \) by multiplying both sides by \( v \) and then dividing by 1:
\[ v = 6. \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters of liquid. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we are left with \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) liters of liquid.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of liquid:
- The amount of water from the orange drink is \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- The amount of water from the pineapple drink is 9 liters.
- The total amount of water is \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters. Let's convert this to a decimal for clarity: \( \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \) liters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the discounted price is $19.50 and this represents a 25% discount from the original price, then the discounted price is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Then we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Finally, we sum up the total cost for all the clothing items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $253.

So, Mishka spent $253 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then determine the cost based on the number of cartons she will need to buy.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

First, we know the total distance of Henry's trip is 60 miles. His first stop was after he had traveled 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

Next, his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:
\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, the total time spent on one dog per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, 25% more points is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]
Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 5 points.

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This will help us determine how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy. 

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 packs is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times $5.00/\text{pack} = $75.00 \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total cost of the video games John buys. He buys 8 video games at $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent on the video games, we subtract the remaining money from the total money he made from selling the lego sets.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 190 \text{ dollars}
\]

We can verify that the amount spent on video games is indeed $160, as calculated earlier.

Finally, since John started with 13 lego sets and he has not sold or given away any lego sets, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in 3 days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day.

The total time he spends running is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs is 60 miles.

To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's running speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[
\text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
And the time spent walking is:
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Ben's iPhone Age:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces of pie.

The final numerical answer is 26."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in a single serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday:** She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).
3. After purchasing the package, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which used up \( x \) post-it notes.
4. She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ 80 - x + x = 220 + 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 80 = 243 - x \]

Rearranging to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 243 - 80 \]

\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a day and then in a week.

Eggs produced per day: 252 eggs

Eggs produced per week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd has per week. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen:

Dozens of eggs per week: 1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week

Now, we calculate how much Lloyd makes from selling these eggs at $2 per dozen:

Earnings per week: 147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, the final numerical answer is $294."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know that he travels back at a rate of 6 mph. However, we don't know the distance he traveled to get to his destination. 

Let's denote the distance from his starting point to his destination as \(D\) miles. 

The time it takes to travel from the starting point to the destination is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time it takes to travel from the starting point to the destination is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{out}} = \frac{D}{10} \]

The time it takes to travel back from the destination is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = \frac{D}{6} \]

Since the total time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, we have:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{out}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = 3 \]

Substituting the expressions for \(\text{Time}_{\text{out}}\) and \(\text{Time}_{\text{back}}\):
\[ \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} = 3 \]

To solve for \(D\), we need a common denominator for the fractions:
\[ \frac{3D + 5D}{30} = 3 \]
\[ \frac{8D}{30} = 3 \]
\[ \frac{4D}{15} = 3 \]
\[ 4D = 45 \]
\[ D = \frac{45}{4} \]
\[ D = 11.25 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we can find the time it takes to travel back:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = \frac{D}{6} = \frac{11.25}{6} = 1.875 \text{ hours} \]

Converting 1.875 hours into minutes:
\[ 1.875 \times 60 = 112.5 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it takes for Tom to get back is:
\[ 1.875 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1.875 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"

"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

First, we know that the adopted kittens are 7.

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together:

\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, the number of bags she can fill is 28 / 2 = 14 bags.

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

First, we start with the original bill amount:
\[ \text{Original bill} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we add the 25% delivery fee to the original bill. To calculate the 25% fee:
\[ \text{25% of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

Adding this fee to the original bill:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee} = \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee and delivery charge} = \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ \text{Final bill} = \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of raspberries scattered across the bush.

There are 6 clusters, each with 20 raspberries, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Additionally, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- One orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \text{ unripe oranges} \]

Next, we know there are 2 sour oranges. 

Now, let's find out how many oranges are either bad, unripe, or sour:
\[ 1 \text{ bad} + 5 \text{ unripe} + 2 \text{ sour} = 8 \text{ oranges} \]

Subtract this from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ good oranges} \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of $1300
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is $50,000 per year.

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension for the first 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - The total pension for the next 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.
   - Total pension after 30 years = $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000.

4. **Annual pension after 30 years:**
   - Since she is entitled to the full pension amount of $1,500,000 over 30 years, her annual pension will be:
   - $1,500,000 / 30 years = $50,000/year.

Thus, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - Aleena pays the full monthly rate of $140.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming company charges 10% less than the full monthly rate.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly rate is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Sum the costs of the first and second halves of the year.
   - Total cost: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip.

She started with 12 gallons and used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. So, the amount of gas left in her tank is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 8 gallons of gas. We know that 4 gallons of gas allow her to drive 100 miles. Therefore, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, the distance she can drive is:
\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"

The final numerical answer is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we first need to calculate how much she received in her weekly allowance over the 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so her total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes her initial amount of money plus the $40 she received in allowances. Let's denote her initial amount of money as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the five cell phones, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest on the five cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total installment amount.
4. Divide the total installment amount by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five cell phones.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total installment amount is the sum of the total cost before interest and the total interest:
   \[
   \text{Total installment amount} = 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months, so the monthly payment is:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- Level 1: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet.
- Level 2: 4 square feet.
- Level 3: 8 square feet.
- Level 4: 16 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year:
- The puppy will live for the rest of its life, and we need to determine how much dog food is required for the remaining days in the first year.
- There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days remaining in the first year is:
  \[
  365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days}
  \]
- The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
  \[
  2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Now, add the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:
\[
180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}
\]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use:
- Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- The number of bags required is:
  \[
  \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags}
  \]

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine how much laundry Sarah does. According to the problem, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we calculate how much laundry Sarah does in terms of David's laundry. The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much David does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4:

\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:

\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the cost after the discount, we first need to determine the discount amount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of grooming is $100. The discount is 30% of $100.

"Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age = A
- Jackson's age = J
- Corey's age = C
- James' age = 10

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, we can solve for Corey's age using the third relationship:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age is 11, we can use the second relationship to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Using the first relationship, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how fast Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles. Therefore, we can calculate Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles as follows:
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

First, calculate 10% of Gerald's original time:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, subtract this 10% from Gerald's original time:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Dogs**: Given that there are 60 dogs.
2. **Number of Cats**: Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. **Number of Rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Total number of students = 200

Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final numerical answer is 40."
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept.

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \)."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which means she has a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will remain with is \(80 - 40 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can sum up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first sum up the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Given that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate the total time required as follows:

1. Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

2. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time required to cover the entire city is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   So, 750 pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   So, 500 pieces are left after Poppy's mom places her pieces.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday:
1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours we've accounted for is the number of hours he watched on Wednesday:
7 - 6 = 1 hour

Since the 1 hour he watched on Wednesday was a 1-hour episode, he did not watch any 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 0."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more, we can verify the calculation:

\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he has:

\[ 115 - 5 = 110 \]

This matches the information given in the problem. Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the final cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the cost would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback reward. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the cashback would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost after the cashback rewards is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to calculate the area of their respective unrolled fruit roll-ups.

For Beatrice:

For Marcell:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups

The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be written as:
\[ B = 50D \]

We already found that \( B = 300 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \( D = 6 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total cost of all the lumber Sasha bought:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after the initial 3 hours:

\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie can cover in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered in both parts of the run to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

First, let's calculate the revenue the hospital receives from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- So, the revenue from each patient is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost the hospital incurs for each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour.
- So, the cost for each patient is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 \) dollars.

Now, we can calculate the profit for each patient:
- Revenue from each patient: $80
- Cost for each patient: $60
- Profit per patient: \( 80 - 60 = 20 \) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total profit for all patients:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- The profit per patient is $20.
- Therefore, the total profit for the day is \( 500 \times 20 = 10000 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
10000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, the number of elves who quit is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \). This leaves \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) elves.
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. This leaves \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, Pam used a total of \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:

- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, Fred used a total of \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, let's add the tickets used by Pam and Fred:

- Pam used 24 tickets.
- Fred used 36 tickets.
- Together, they used \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the miles he walked on Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

So, the miles he walked on Wednesday is:
\[ 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:
\[ 13 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we can multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. Therefore, the cost per month is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for a year would be:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$720 \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Given that there are 27 unicorns in total and one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
- Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each.
- Total cost for subs = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
- Rory orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for chips = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
- Rory orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each.
- Total cost for cookies = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items before the delivery fee and tip:
- Total cost of items = $15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee:
- Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
- Total cost with delivery fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip:
- Total cost with tip = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Finally, we sum the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Thus, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs (\( B = 12 \)), we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of pink gumballs (\( P \)):
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"First, let's determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"

"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups.

The cost of nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of nonfood items before tax:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%:
\[ \text{Tax} = 7 \times 0.10 = 0.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items to get the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items to get the overall total cost:
\[ 8 + 7.70 = 15.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost including tax is:
\[ \boxed{15.70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of the bleach and cloths for all clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of one pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the cost for one client is:

\[ 2 \times 2 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 clients, the total cost for all clients is:

\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses:

\[ 92 - 72 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** Initially, there were 0 bees (since all were out). After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so the hive had \( 0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \) bees. In the next 6 hours, 60 more bees left, so the hive had \( -15 - 60 = -75 \) bees. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before (30 + 60 = 90 bees) return to the hive, so the hive now has \( -75 + 90 = 15 \) bees.

Since the question asks for the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, and we know that all 90 bees that left before returned, the answer is:

15 bees."

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Dorothy's number of friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the total cost of inflating the tires for all the vehicles that came by.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 10 tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 9 tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, so there is 1 * 1 = 1 tire to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 1 tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, we sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
- 500 cents = 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."

"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon stole the fries, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate the fries, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate the fries, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries that Dave bought originally had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours he spends in class on these days is:
\[3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours he spends in class on these days is:
\[4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, we add the hours spent on the days with 3-hour classes and the days with 4-hour classes to find the total number of hours he spends in class each week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot. So, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

First, let's calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we sum the monthly requirements:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the water depth on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the water depth on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the water depth on Wednesday is:

"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[32\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine the number of price increases that occur in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases is:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. After each price increase, the new price is 120% of the previous price. This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by 1.20. We can use the formula for compound interest to find the price after 18 increases:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{209.76} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Given that an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. 

Missed income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will pay $90 for the service. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income she would have lost by doing her taxes herself.

Additional money she will have = Missed income - Cost of hiring an accountant
Additional money she will have = $105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €102 = €435

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €435 = €1065

So, the final numerical answer is €1065."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, to make 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age \( S \):
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders with 8 legs each:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects with 6 legs each:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum up the total legs from all the groups:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of the birds based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel and cut each potato. 

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

To add these times together, we need to convert the time to cut one potato into minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{60} = \frac{1}{12} \) minutes.

So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is:
\[ 1.5 + \frac{1}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator:
\[ 1.5 = \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{18}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{19}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare. The total time to prepare all 60 potatoes is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{19}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 5 \times 19 = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( 10 \) dollars per gallon, and they made a profit of $25, so:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. The correct approach is to consider the cost of ingredients per gallon. The cost of ingredients per gallon is:

\[ \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} = 3 + 2 = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Now, we can use the profit formula again:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 \]
\[ 25 = 5 - C \]
\[ C = 5 - 25 \]
\[ C = -20 \]

This negative value again indicates an error. The correct approach is to consider the total cost of ingredients per gallon and the profit. The total cost of ingredients per gallon is $5, and the profit is $25, so the total revenue must be:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Since the revenue per gallon is $10, the number of gallons sold is:

\[ \text{Number of gallons} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Revenue per gallon}} = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \]

The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is:

\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**

   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**
   \[

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}

So, the final numerical answer is 350 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} \]
\[ \text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 40 + 36 = 76 \]
\[ 76 + 46 = 122 \]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ 122 \]"
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then add the totals together.

For the first week:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Adding the totals for both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the second piece of information:
\[
200 = 5w
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

\[
\boxed{160}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's find out Mark's age two years ago. Since Jan is 30, two years ago she was 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 14. Mark was 5 years less than this, so Mark was 14 - 5 = 9 years old two years ago.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago. So, Mark is 9 + 2 = 11 years old now.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 11 + 2 = 13 years old.

The final numerical answer is 13."
"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters (4 laps) relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability \(P(\text{number} > 3)\) is:

\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability \(P(\text{two even numbers in a row})\) is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25
\]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, then Jenna picked half as many, which is 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find the number of pieces of straw given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount she owes.

The original amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 in decimal form.

First, we calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest for one month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we add the interest to the original amount to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the friends:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for tickets and food: $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.
- Total cost for rides: $66.
- Total cost: $36 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
- Each person's share: $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $34."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect in 3 hours, given that he collects 2 peaches per minute.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can start by calculating the total amount of insects needed per day for all the ducks combined.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/week} \times 10 = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much insects are needed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"

50 \text{ trees} + 80 \text{ trees} = 130 \text{ trees}
\]

Now, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. Calculate the number of trees that die:
\[
0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
\]

Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
\[
130 \text{ trees} - 39 \text{ trees} = 91 \text{ trees}
\]

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of flamingos on Friday morning:** 18 pink flamingos.

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the prank on Saturday morning:**
   - Remaining pink flamingos: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - New white flamingos: 6.

4. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - Total pink flamingos: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - Total white flamingos: 6.

5. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30.
   - White flamingos: 6.

6. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 5 crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared:

\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of Pokemon cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[

"First, let's determine the rate at which Mark is paid by Publisher B. Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Mark earns from each publisher. He edits 1000 sentences each week. Therefore, the amount he earns from Publisher A is:

\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

And the amount he earns from Publisher B is:

\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total amount Mark earns in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

"To calculate how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- 5% of $2000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 2000 = 100 \).

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
- $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John makes in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His new weekly salary is $2100.
- Therefore, his total annual salary is \( 52 \times 2100 = 1092000 \).

Additionally, John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:
- $1092000 (from his new salary) + $5000 (one-time reward) = $1097000.

The final numerical answer is:
1097000"

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 27 slices.

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 27."

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Therefore, the total sum of the six test scores needed is:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. We subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score needed on the sixth test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Thus, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in four weeks = 4 weeks * 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride.

Let's calculate this:
\[ 4 \times 5 \times 25 = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in three weeks = 3 weeks * 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride.

Let's calculate this:
\[ 3 \times 2 \times 60 = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Total kilometers:**
- Sum of kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we can calculate the cost per cup as follows:

Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

The total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, which is $70 in total. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \).

The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70 \]
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks around.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. By the end of the third day, the total number of customers counted by Sloane was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we can subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers counted by the end of the third day.

So, the number of customers counted on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's recheck the equations and the context. The correct interpretation should be:

\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify:
If the small pool has 8 gallons now, then the big pool has \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) gallons now. 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons (which is not possible, so we need to recheck the setup again).

Rechecking the setup again, we get:
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[
\text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Now, determine their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is:
\[

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[

- Total cost for Carlos = $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji = $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider the time it takes for each leg of his trip.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. 

Next, we are told that it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Therefore, the travel time by car is:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Now, Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and then return from Rochester to New Jersey by car. The total travel time will be the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip:
\[
6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the new number of water type cards after James loses 8 of them and then buys 14 more grass type cards. 

Initially, James has 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

Then, he buys 14 more grass type cards, but this does not affect the number of water type cards. So, the number of water type cards remains 32.

The total number of cards James has now is:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} + 14 \text{ (grass type)} = 76 \text{ cards} \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{76} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{76} \right) \times 100 \approx 42.105263157894736 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito before any upgrades or discounts:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. The farm initially produced 120 watermelons, and 30% of them were ready for harvest.

\[
\text{Number of watermelons ready for harvest} = 0.30 \times 120 = 36
\]

Ashlyn took these 36 watermelons home. This means the remaining number of watermelons is:

\[
120 - 36 = 84
\]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. Let's calculate how many of these were ready:

\[
\text{Number of watermelons ready after two weeks} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
\]

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. We subtract the number of watermelons that were ready from the remaining watermelons:

\[
84 - 63 = 21
\]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars:

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the original cost of the cars:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark buys 12 cars:

\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the total cost of the cars including tax:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ 276,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, Kylie collects \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36
2. **One-third jump in the ocean**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.
3. **Another one-third go inside the cave**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.
4. **Total number of penguins that leave to swim or eat**:
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]
5. **Number of penguins left sunbathing**:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's determine how much Steve eats per day. According to the question, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. The problem states that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce in a week:
\[ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for his weekly consumption. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of recycling the pens. Ram starts with 25 pens and can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. This means that for every five empty pens, he can create one new pen.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Recycling Cycle**: He can use the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. After this cycle, he will have 20 pens (25 - 5) and 1 new pen.
3. **Second Recycling Cycle**: Now he has 21 pens (20 + 1) and can use the ink from 5 more pens to make 1 new pen. After this cycle, he will have 16 pens (21 - 5) and 2 new pens.
4. **Third Recycling Cycle**: Now he has 17 pens (16 + 1) and can use the ink from 5 more pens to make 1 new pen. After this cycle, he will have 12 pens (17 - 5) and 3 new pens.
5. **Fourth Recycling Cycle**: Now he has 13 pens (12 + 1) and can use the ink from 5 more pens to make 1 new pen. After this cycle, he will have 8 pens (13 - 5) and 4 new pens.
6. **Fifth Recycling Cycle**: Now he has 9 pens (8 + 1) and can use the ink from 5 more pens to make 1 new pen. After this cycle, he will have 4 pens (9 - 5) and 5 new pens.
7. **Sixth Recycling Cycle**: Now he has 5 pens (4 + 1) and can use the ink from 5 more pens to make 1 new pen. After this cycle, he will have 0 pens (5 - 5) and 6 new pens.

At this point, Ram has no more empty pens to recycle, but he has 6 new pens. Therefore, the total number of pens he has is the initial 25 pens plus the 6 new pens he made, which totals to 31 pens.

The final answer is:
31"

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each girl based on the information provided.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we add the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Let's perform the addition:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students remain after those who went through exit A. This is calculated as:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Now, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. We can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

The rest of the students went out through exit C. To find out how many students went through exit C, we subtract the number of students who went through exit B from the remaining students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. **Determine Robert's Candies:**

   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) candies.

2. **Determine James' Candies:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.

3. **Find the Difference Between John's and James' Candies:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - The difference is \( 54 - 33 = 21 \) candies.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total minutes.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks.

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means she pays 90% of the total cost.

Discounted cost = $30,000 * 0.90 = $27,000

So, the final numerical answer is $27,000."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day.

On Monday:
- Her sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Her sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Each cookie has 200 calories.

Total calories consumed by Sue:
- \(46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\)

Total calories consumed by her sister:
- \(18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\)

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since each class has 20 students, and there are 30 girls in total, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know from the problem that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night. From last night, we know he killed 15 cougars. Therefore, today he killed:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

Since today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, he killed:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

So, the total number of animals killed today is:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

Adding the animals killed last night and today, the total number of animals killed is:
\[ 25 \text{ animals} + 48 \text{ animals} = 73 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to 10 * 20 = 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 new cows. 

So, each stall now has 20 (original cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 176."
"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}

1 \text{ dollar} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Brady has a total of **45 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"First, let's determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Length per section}}\right) \times \text{Weight per section} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of the total weight:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 0.70 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Andrea's apples \( A_a \) can be expressed as \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_a = 52 \).
3. Therefore, \( J_a + 8 = 52 \), which means \( J_a = 44 \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
5. Substituting \( J_a = 44 \) into the equation, we get \( J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together. Andrea has 52 apples and 0 bananas (since the problem doesn't mention any bananas for Andrea), so Andrea has a total of 52 fruits. Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has a total of \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

Adding the fruits together, we get:
\[ 52 + 92 = 144 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 144."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{62}
\]"

"First, let's determine the number of trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry's yard has 8 more trees than Ferdinand's yard. The final numerical answer is:

8"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to find the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total fees Mr. Tan paid. This includes the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees from the selling price and then subtract the loan amount.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. The additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that the time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Thus, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the cooking time:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 51 \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the number of golf balls. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls and half of these are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of blue golf balls = 8 / 2
Number of blue golf balls = 4

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Windows in bedrooms:** Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of windows in bedrooms is:
   \[
   3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
   \]

2. **Additional windows:** Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms. So, for one house, the number of additional windows is:
   \[
   4 \text{ windows/house}
   \]

3. **Total windows in one house:** Adding the windows from bedrooms and additional windows gives:
   \[
   6 \text{ windows/house} + 4 \text{ windows/house} = 10 \text{ windows/house}
   \]

4. **Total windows in both houses:** Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is:
   \[
   10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

1. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the collar, rosette, and body of the sweater, we get the total stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 - 900 = 630
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2.
\[
\text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
\]

Thus, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is:
\[
\boxed{315}

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   Adding up the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene:

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \text{Sam's current age} = 6 \]"

So, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots for a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding the total spots for the cobras and mambas gives us the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total spots by 2:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests.

Total number of people = team members + coaches + guests
Total number of people = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people.

Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:

Number of pizzas needed = Total number of people / Number of people each pizza serves
Number of pizzas needed = 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:

Total cost = Number of pizzas needed * Cost per pizza
Total cost = 13 * 15 = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads. Finally, we'll divide that length by the length of each sterling silver bead to find the number of beads.

1. **Calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:**
   Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones.
   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total length used by the sterling silver beads:**
   The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtract the length used by the topaz gemstones from the total length.
   \[
   \text{Total length of sterling silver beads} = 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

There are two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Therefore, the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can start by determining the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she works for 150 minutes.

For every 10 minutes of work, Susan earns $5. Therefore, for 150 minutes of work, she earns:

\[
\frac{150}{10} \times 5 = 15 \times 5 = 75
\]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.
3. Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.**

- Mike's points remain 21.
- Jim's points remain 18.
- Tony's points increase by 1 to 43.

Now, we sum the points of all three players:
\[ 21 + 18 + 43 = 82 \]

The total points after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Kai's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of each exercise Darren does on the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Next, we calculate the number of each exercise Darren does on the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we calculate the total number of each exercise done over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up the total number of exercises done over the two days:
- Total exercises = 220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The final numerical answer is:
370"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day. Therefore, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \times 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - The opening bid is $200.
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350.

Carmen's total expenditure is the sum of her bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen paid for the desk is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost is $2 per mile, so the cost for 15,000 miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- John gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 50 weeks in a year, which means there are 50/4 = 12.5 months in a year. Since we can't have half a month in this context, we'll consider 12 months for simplicity (as bonuses are typically given monthly and not split). So, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each side. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can be used to print 2 pages.
2. Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

So, the number of pieces of paper needed is 16."
"First, let's calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the remaining amount is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25:

\[
25 - 10 = 15

"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's determine the number of days Watson works in April. April has 30 days, and he works 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of days he works in April is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings from his hourly wage. He works 10 hours each day and earns $10 per hour. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Since he works 20 days in April, his total earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 20 \text{ days} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$2000 \]

Additionally, since the company performed very well for the whole month, he receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, the total bonus for April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$300/\text{week} = \$1200 \]

Adding his total earnings from his hourly wage and his bonus, we get:
\[ \$2000 + \$1200 = \$3200 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can calculate the number of people he beats as follows:

\[ \text{Number of people John beats} = 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestles 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beats:

\[ \text{Number of people John loses to} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of loaves sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, we need to find half of the remaining 20 loaves:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in one week, Sandy needs:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{4 \text{ weeks}}{4} = 1 \text{ week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the original and discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

The final numerical answer is:
$6"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 3, which is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 5, which is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = number of extra arms + number of extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- Total cost for business suits = 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- Total cost for suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- Cost of a business suit = $100.
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
- Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
- Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his trip and wishes to save $2000 for it. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip is:
- Amount to spend = Total money - Savings
- Amount to spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Finally, let's calculate how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners:
- Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total cost of items
- Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The final numerical answer is $2050."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the daily consumption and then scale it up to a weekly total.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \times 7 = 91 \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age. We know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve the problem, let's first determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000. Since the population of Chile has doubled since then, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So we have:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8. 

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 / 4 = 2\).

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\(24 - 10 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by Solomon's father to the total number of marbles in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) to fill the pool is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and knowing that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men out of the 40 people who were there initially must have stayed. Therefore, the number of men who left is 40 - 22 = 18 men.

Since 10 people in total left, and 18 men left, the remaining 10 - 18 = -8 people (which is not possible, indicating an error in the interpretation of the question) must be women, as the total number of people who left is 10.

Given that 10 people left and 22 men stayed, the number of women who left is 10 - 22 = -12 (again, not possible, indicating an error in the question's setup).

However, if we consider the question's setup correctly, we can deduce that the number of women who left is 10 - 22 = -12, which is not possible. Instead, we should focus on the number of women who stayed.

Since 10 people left in total and 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is 22 - (10 - 22) = 22 - (-12) = 22 + 12 = 34 women.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 34."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of pencils Jam has can be expressed as:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 24 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of the cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is solely due to the cooling.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ 60 \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]
lollipops left.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]
lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
lollipops. Adding these to the remaining lollipops, he now has:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]
lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
lollipops. Subtracting these from the total, he has:
\[ 36 - 5 = 31 \]
lollipops left.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:

"The phone is currently at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. 

To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:
100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to fully charge the phone.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final numerical answer is 2."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the $8 rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards, which is twice $8 = $16.
   - After applying the $16 coupon, the cost becomes $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine which job Nick should choose, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before property tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Net income tax rate: 10%
- Net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."

So, the final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Purchase Value:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Price Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value After First Year:**
   Maria now has 8 shares at the new price of $12 each.
   \[
   \text{Value After First Year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls. This means he loses 3 balls, so he is left with \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls.

Two of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, and one is lost completely. Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 4 balls on stage."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds

"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors when they made tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos now that they make silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out what percentage more they are making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

- Dean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2, so the total cost for the toy cars is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- Dean bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1, so the total cost for the teddy bears is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the toys is \(12 + 5 = 17\) dollars.

Dean started with $28 and spent $17 on toys, so he has \(28 - 17 = 11\) dollars left.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so Dean now has \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is $21."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants to do:

- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so $10 * 2 = $20

Adding these up, the total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends:

$90 - $30 = $60

So, Morgan can invite friends with $60 left in her budget. Since each friend gets $5 worth of tokens, the number of friends she can invite is:

$60 / $5 = 12

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 12."
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily change Marisa gets.
2. Determine the total change over 5 days.

First, let's calculate the daily change:
- Marisa gets $5 every day.
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents, which is equivalent to $0.25.
- She buys 4 lollipops each day, so the total cost for the lollipops each day is:
  \[
  4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ dollar}
  \]
- Therefore, the daily change she saves is:
  \[
  5 - 1 = 4 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total change over 5 days:
- Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:
  \[
  4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

So, the total amount spent on gumballs is $2. This means the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 5.3333 pounds."
"To find the age of Carver's son, let's denote the son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third and back to first) is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance the train needs service, which is 18,000 miles.

So, the number of days between services is:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Therefore, the train goes between services every 0.0375 days."
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to return home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house, the time for the detour, and the time to return home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + 6 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys there are. We know that 43 of the 96 are girls, so the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. Therefore, the number of absent boys is 4. To find the number of boys present on Friday, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 49 \]"

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on her third test. The equation for the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]

\[
\boxed{9}

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is:
\[ 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

Three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21. \]

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out of the Walmart is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers kicked out minus the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ \boxed{19}. \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the current point totals and then work backwards.

1. Sara's current points: 8
2. Erin's current points: 14
3. Erin now has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin's current points are three times Sara's current points.

Let's verify:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's current points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This confirms that Erin currently has 24 points.

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment after the faulty ones are returned.

First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

\[
\text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces}
\]

Let \( N \) be the total number of pieces of equipment. Then:

\[
\text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4N
\]

Since the total cost of the equipment is $400,000, the cost per piece of equipment is:

\[
\text{Cost per piece} = \frac{400000}{N}
\]

The total cost of the faulty pieces is:

\[
\text{Total cost of faulty pieces} = 0.4N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.4 \times 400000 = 160000
\]

The total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total cost of all pieces minus the cost of the faulty pieces:

\[
\text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = 400000 - 160000 = 240000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to determine the number of apples she picked on each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. We can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total amount of money she made by the price per apple:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Now, we sum the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[
\text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 49

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to get the total amount she will pay back. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months.

The formula for calculating the total amount to be paid back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Interest Rate = 10% or 0.10
- Time = 5 months

First, calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is 50% girls, it is also 50% boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

So, the choir has 26 girls and 26 boys, making a total of 52 members.

Next, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. Therefore, the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Thus, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 \text{ (female members)} + 3 \text{ (teachers)} = 16

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has 12 gifts in total.

Next, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will get:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. So, the savings per month for Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $10, which is $2.
- Therefore, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount is $10 - $2 = $8 per month each.

Now, let's add up the monthly cost of the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total monthly cost for streaming services:
$10 + $8 + $8 = $26

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. By cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services, he saves:
$60 - $26 = $34 per month.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. I'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on all activities:
- Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100

Let's calculate this:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, the final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of slots in the shelving system. Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:

\[ B = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

Now, we calculate \( B \):

\[ B = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.
- Adding these together, Erica has \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She gave 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she has:

\[ 50 - 24 - 5 + 17 = 42 \]

So, Erica now has 42 Valentine's cards."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices in the pizza is 12. Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- Total flour needed: 12 cups
- Number of 2-cup bags required: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- Total milk needed: 4 cups
- Number of 2-cup bottles required: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- Difference: \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

Thus, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy usage of the air conditioner under two different scenarios: the original usage and the reduced usage. Then, we can find the difference in energy usage over 30 days.

First, let's calculate the energy usage of the air conditioner under the original usage scenario:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
- It is used for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily energy usage is:
  \[
  900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day}
  \]
- To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
  \[
  7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the energy usage under the reduced usage scenario:
- The air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).
- Therefore, the daily energy usage is:
  \[
  900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day}
  \]
- Converting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
  \[
  2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day}
  \]

Now, let's find the daily energy savings:
\[
7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} - 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} = 4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day}
\]

Finally, to find the total energy savings over 30 days:
\[
4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
\]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[
\boxed{135}

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[29.33\]"
"To solve this, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the initial number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: The number of corns is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis. Since the number of cannolis is now 100, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).
5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis**: The combined total is the sum of the new number of cannolis and the new number of corns, which is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160."

He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final numerical answer is 4,000."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 70 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 = 50 \text{ minutes before the airport} \]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, we can determine how early he will be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} - \text{Time to read the book} = 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

First, we calculate the number of apples Joanne gathers from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, Joanne gathers 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, Joanne gathers half of 30, which is 15 apples.
- From the average trees, Joanne gathers \( A \) apples.

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A = 45 + A \]

Next, we calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, her sister gathers twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- From the shortest trees, her sister gathers three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- From the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples.

So, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (45 + A) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 45 + A + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[
124 + d = 180
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
d = 180 - 124

   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is $14 per month.
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$112 = \$184
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{184}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of both jeans. The total cost is:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's verify the savings. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 from it. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 from it. The total savings are indeed $6.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

Therefore, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 180 birds.

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, which gives him:
\[ \text{Total money from selling cards} = \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 1x = x \]

He has $50 in spending cash after keeping 1/3 of the cards and selling the rest. This means he spent $50 on the ticket to the amusement park.

So, the total money he got from selling the cards is equal to the cost of the ticket plus the money he kept:
\[ x = 100 + 50 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. Initially, the caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of the guests expected to eat two hotdogs each. This means:

\[
\text{Number of guests eating two hotdogs} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
\]

Thus, the caterer prepared:

\[
18 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs per guest} = 36 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs per guest} = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 \text{ guests} - 36 \text{ hotdogs} = 4 \text{ guests}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters, so the total number of letters is:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

- Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

- Final amount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's determine the number of dragons slain by each prince.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5. To find out how much money he had left, we calculate 1% of $5:

\[ 1\% \text{ of } \$5 = \frac{1}{100} \times 5 = \$0.05 \]

So, George had $0.05 left after buying the chips. This means he spent:

\[ \$5 - \$0.05 = \$4.95 \]

Next, we know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents. Since he bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = \$1.20 \]

However, we know he only spent $4.95 on chips, which means there's a discrepancy. Let's recheck the problem statement and the calculations. The problem states he spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of $5, not $4.95. So, the correct amount spent on chips is $1.20.

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ \$5 - \$1.20 = \$3.80 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

\[ \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} = 5.0667 \]

Since he can only buy whole candy bars, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

So, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops among his four friends. Each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This makes a total of 8 people (2 + 6 = 8).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

Oranges per person = 56 / 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00/serving

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave} = \text{Time Wayne takes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute}
\]

Since Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute earlier than the time Wayne arrives, we conclude that Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width as follows:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

3. **Temperature Change from Opening the Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.

4. **Final Temperature Calculation**: 
   - Initial temperature = 40 degrees.
   - Temperature increase from the oven = 15 degrees.
   - Temperature decrease from the window = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
   - Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which totals:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

2 trays"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores an additional 26 points.
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]
So, Joey's new score is 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores an additional 10 points.
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]
So, Marcy's new score is 235 points.

Now, we find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]
So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, let's determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The department store bought these 31 sneakers for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both sales:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from both types of packets separately and then sum them up.

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This can be expressed as:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase.

Given that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the original cost per balloon as follows:
\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20 \text{ balloons}} = \$45 \text{ per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \text{ per balloon} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \text{ balloons} \times \$65 \text{ per balloon} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5 = 10200 + 850 = \$11050 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

For the first part of the trip:
- Speed = 60 mph
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip:
- Speed = 30 mph
- Time = 1 hour
- Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the remaining sapphires. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's determine the value of the rubies Jenna receives. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then add those amounts together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. 

To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 78."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in total, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer:

- For every pack Heather buys, she gets another pack for free.
- Since she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 packs for free.
- Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack of razors.

So, the cost for 2 packs with the ""buy one get one free"" offer is $4.00.

Next, let's apply the $2.00 coupon:

- The total cost after applying the $2.00 coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost per razor:

- Each pack contains 4 razors.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets 2 * 4 = 8 razors.
- The cost for 8 razors is $2.00.

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:

- Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Finally, converting the cost per razor to cents:

- $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of girls in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of each cheerleader is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[
\boxed{53}
\]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she works. Since she works for 8 hours each day, the number of minutes she walks each day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total number of minutes she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this, let's first establish the current age of Brett and then use the information given to find Angela's current age.

Brett is currently 14 years old.

In four years, Brett's age will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14, three times his current age is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

So, in four years Angela will be 42 years old. To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years:
\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:
38"
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to consider both his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides he took each day:
- Morning rides: 1
- Afternoon rides: 1

So, each day he took a total of:
\[ 1 \text{ (morning)} + 1 \text{ (afternoon)} = 2 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides over 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we calculate the cost for each type of ride:
- Cost per morning ride: $6
- Cost per afternoon ride: $2

Total cost for morning rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Total cost for afternoon rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 25n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 25:
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16."
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Twice the rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Couch's length} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). We know that Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. Let's confirm this by calculating the total cost:
- Two packs of strawberry gum: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars
- One pack of grape gum: $2
- One pack of green apple gum: $1

Total cost:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

The calculations confirm that the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is indeed $2.

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of using 2 x 4 pieces of wood versus 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 4 = $4
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 4 = 200
  - Cost per stick = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 8 = 400
  - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should use as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible within his budget of $24.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
- Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
- Total budget = $24
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

Next, we calculate the total number of sticks he can get from these 4 pieces:
- Number of sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs:**

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 bus trips each day.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- Thus, the total cost of her bus trips per week is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
- Savings = Total cost of bus trips - Cost of bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep, which is half as many sheep as the farm has cows, confirming the information given. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

The total number of animals on the farm is \(30 \text{ (cows)} + 0 \text{ (sheep)} = 30 \text{ animals}\).

The total number of animals in the zoo is \(0 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 20 \text{ animals}\).

Therefore, the combined total number of animals on the farm and zoo is \(30 + 20 = 50\).

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and he knows that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his goal date of July 19th. Today is December 31st, so we calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to December 31st is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to December 31st is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to December 31st is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{180 \text{ days}} = 583.33 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 583.33 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. If she divides these equally among the three recipes, each recipe will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, the number of batches she can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \(12 \times 1.50 = 18\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity after adding the new device:
- The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(12 + 2 = 14\) kilowatts per hour.
- The daily cost is \(14 \times 1.50 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly cost before adding the new device is \(18 \times 7 = 126\) dollars.
- The weekly cost after adding the new device is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:
- The difference is \(147 - 126 = 21\) dollars.

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. **Determine the work rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint 1/2 house in 5 days.
   - The work rate of one person is \(\frac{1/2 \text{ house}}{5 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}\).

2. **Determine the work rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}\), then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}\).

3. **Determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}\), to paint a whole house, they would need \(2 \text{ days}\).

4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \(2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \).
   - Therefore, \( C_O = 20 + 2 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).
   - Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \).
   - Therefore, \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = \( 20 + 64 = 84 \).
   - Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = \( 22 + 66 = 88 \).
   - Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is 172."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the headphone set:**
   - Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
   - The CD cost $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
     \[
     48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the money spent on the headphone set:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - With $44, the number of CDs Tom could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ CDs}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom would have $48.
   - With $48, the number of CDs he could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}
     \]

Thus, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 1 more CD. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Lastly, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours from the different weeks:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off (which is 21). So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 in 8 years, which means:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

So, Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of the two now is:

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( C = 1100 \)
3. \( P = C - 400 \)

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the third equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substituting the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl.

First, let's establish the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's denote the number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month. The second half of the month will then have \( 15 \) days (since \( 30 / 2 = 15 \)) and Elvis will save \( 2x \) in the second half.

The total savings for the month should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 2x = 1125
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
3x = 1125
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375
\]

So, Elvis saves \( 375 \) in the first half of the month. For the second half, he saves \( 2x \):

\[
2x = 2 \times 375 = 750
\]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \( 750 \) for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

3. Adding the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub gives:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

Thus, the total cost for lunch today is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have two holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have four holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Given that Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Octavia's daily coffee intake:**
   - The daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups.

   - Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) cups of coffee daily.

2. **Determine Juan's daily coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks.
   - Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) cups of coffee daily.

3. **Determine the reduction needed for Juan:**
   - Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
   - Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight of the three friends, we sum their weights and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3 to find the average:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[ 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 180 \]"

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs to buy.

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

So, James needs candles for 2 sons, which means he needs 2 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. Since he only needs 2 candles, he doesn't need to buy a full pack. Instead, he will buy 1 pack of 5 candles, which will be enough for the 2 candles he needs.

Therefore, James spends $3 on candles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for these three teeth, she received $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. So, for these two teeth, she received $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we sum up all the money Sharon received:
- $5.00 (for the first tooth)
- $3.00 (for the next three teeth)
- $1.00 (for the last two teeth)

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures.

\[ \text{Cost of wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures. There are 4 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) during which he buys plastic action figures.

\[ \text{Cost of plastic action figures} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

After buying the plastic action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[ 50 - 8 = 42 \]

Now, we calculate how many wooden action figures he can buy with the $20 he spent on them:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the $42 he has left:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]

Finally, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 21 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- 20 roses to the first shop
- 15 roses to the second shop
- 30 roses to the third shop

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months. If she removes $100 each month, the total amount removed over 24 months is \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount:
\[3000 - 2400 = 600\]

So, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 sandwiches:
- Cost of bread: $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, for 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread, which costs $3.00.
- Cost of cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Revenue from selling 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

The error in degrees for 520 degrees is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20.8 \]

So, the actual temperature she should set the oven to is:
\[ 520 - 20.8 = 509.2 \]

Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is:
\[ 509.2 \]

"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
- Judy's cups: 12
- Friend's cups: 40
- Total cups: \(12 + 40 = 52\)

Total dishes brought:
- Judy's dishes: 24
- Friend's dishes: 44
- Total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

"First, let's calculate the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount:

Original price of one box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00

Discounted price of one box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be:

Total cost for 2 boxes = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

Total contacts in 2 boxes = 2 * 90 = 180 contacts

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:

Number of pairs of contacts = 180 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 90 pairs

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:

Cost per pair of contacts = Total cost for 2 boxes / Number of pairs of contacts = $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair

So, the final numerical answer is $2.00."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked:

- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.

So, Jill's total hours worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked:

- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

So, John's total hours worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John:

- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

So, the final numerical answer is $40."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speed for the third test. The initial speed is 47 WPM, and after the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words per minute, the third test speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have the three typing speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

First, we calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Then, we divide by 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[ 52 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake for a week:
\[ \text{Protein intake per week} = 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

- The base price for each implant is $2000.
- George needs 2 implants, so the base cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\).
- One of the implants has an additional porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
- The total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\).

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\).

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents, so the number of gumballs Colby can buy is:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

The final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Total legs for dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs for cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs for birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we add up the total number of legs for all the pets:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. He increases this weight by 50%, so the increase is:

\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this to the original weight:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since this weight is too heavy, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break down his purchases and gifts year by year.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate Marissa's hourly rate as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa together:

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract that from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday**: Howard spends $8.
2. **Tuesday**: He spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. **Wednesday**: He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times \$0.50 = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times \$0.60 = \$12 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:

"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can find the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of dozens Juan wants to make in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Dozens per day} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Days in a week} = 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total dozens in a week} = 4 \text{ dozens/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozens}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozens:**
   \[
   \text{Butter per dozen} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozens} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds}

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ \$65,560 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$65,560 \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period are already covered by the initial funding.
   - Therefore, the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - Each month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars.

3. **Total Funding for Extended Period:**
   - The total cost for the 45 months of extended funding is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of Research:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to sum the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the number of days in March and then multiply it by the average number of posts per day per member.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. Therefore, the number of street lights at each intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 4 \text{ intersections} \times 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played to the total number of times they can be played before breaking.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks and has been played 356 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ more times} \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times before it breaks and has been played 135 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ more times} \]

Adding the remaining play counts of both DVDs together:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[ 1509 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

First, John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time. Therefore, the total number of sessions is:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

Next, since each session is 2 hours long, the total number of hours John spent in therapy is:
\[ 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost of the therapy is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of John's physical therapy is:
\[ \boxed{3000} \]"
"Let's break down Jim's gum consumption and distribution step by step.

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Consumption During School Hours**:
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school.
   - A school day lasts 8 hours.
   - Therefore, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum during school hours.

3. **Gum Consumption on the Way Home**:
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Consumption After Dinner**:
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**:
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed.
   - Let's calculate the remaining gum after chewing and before giving to his sister.

   - After chewing during school hours, he has 20 - 4 = 16 pieces left.
   - After chewing on the way home, he has 16 - 1 = 15 pieces left.
   - After chewing after dinner, he has 15 - 1 = 14 pieces left.
   - He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives 14 / 2 = 7 pieces to his sister.
   - Therefore, he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"Charmaine is currently 16 years old in 12 years. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we subtract 4 years from her current age.

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 85 \]"
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. So, we calculate the number of bloomed flowers:
\[ \text{Number of bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert kb to Mb by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

\[ 72 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Adam will need 4 years to grow to the required height. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost the company paid is:

\[ \text{Cost paid by the company} = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the cost paid by the company:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave. Of these 25 riders, 60% are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

This means the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a diamond jewel:**
   \[
   \text{Price of a diamond jewel} = \$2000
   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

\[
16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead and Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to close the gap.

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour. This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour.

Given that Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( C \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[ C = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the condition that the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, Manny can miss all 10 classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. Therefore, the number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

"To solve this, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we find the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we find the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:

Total extra cost = King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500
Total extra cost = $13,500

Finally, we add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:

Total cost = Base price + Total extra cost

Total cost = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the raise and bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the raise amount.
2. Calculate the bonus amount.
3. Add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary.
4. Multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

Let's start with the raise:

- Original monthly salary: $20000
- Raise percentage: 5%
- Raise amount = 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000

Next, the bonus:

- Bonus amount = Half a month's salary = 0.5 * $20000 = $10000

Now, add the raise and bonus to the original salary:

- New monthly salary = Original salary + Raise amount + Bonus amount
- New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to find the total time to dig the well:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to dig through soil} + \text{Time to dig through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the sales from green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from red hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find the sales in the second month. According to the problem, the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we can calculate the total sales over the two months by adding the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales over two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time James hired the carriage:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired: 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid time: 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.
   - Cost for the first hour: $15.
   - Cost for the second hour: $15 * 2 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour: $30 * 2 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs for the paid hours:**
   - First hour: $15
   - Second hour: $30
   - Third hour: $60
   - Total cost: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the carriage service."

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage of $300 is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:
\[ 420 - 300 = 120 \]

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $120.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests:

\[
3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
\]

Since each deviled egg is made from 2 halves, we need to find the total number of eggs required:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
\]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen}
\]

Thus, Lori will need:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

dozens of eggs."
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper, which means she has written \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) pages.

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 20 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for renting a hanger and fuel, then sum these up for a full year.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent the hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   The total monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel is:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Cost:**
   To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   Adding the initial cost of the plane to the annual cost of renting and fueling the plane:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

1. **Rice**: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the items:
\[
30 \text{ minutes (rice)} + 50 \text{ minutes (pork)} + 40 \text{ minutes (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:

\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:

\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:

\[ S + G = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive coffee:
1. Calculate 20% of $5:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]
2. Add this to the original price:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \]
So, the more expensive coffee costs $6 per pound.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2:

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

From the information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)
4. \( K = 68 \)

Using the first equation, we can substitute \( K \) with 68:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, using the second equation, we can find \( C \):
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Next, using the third equation, we can find \( S \):
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these values:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half of his lawn in turtle mode and the time it takes to mow the other half in rabbit mode, and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In turtle mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In rabbit mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode, we need to find the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

For turtle mode:
- Half of the lawn in turtle mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode.

For rabbit mode:
- Half of the lawn in rabbit mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we sum the times for both halves of the lawn:
- Time in turtle mode: 30 minutes
- Time in rabbit mode: 20 minutes

Total time to mow the entire lawn:
\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. They have 30 minutes in total.
2. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
3. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we add the time they have already spent walking:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = 1 kilo * $4/kilo = $4.

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, we sum the costs of the apples, bananas, and oranges:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Therefore, the total amount Catherine pays is $14."
"Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so she bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies. Together, they bake \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies. After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left in the box is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of the five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one candy. Since four candies cost $1.20, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many coins Rong and Neil save per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong per month. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings in ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings in ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, the total number of coins they have together after ten years is:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Adding these costs together gives the total price for one crate of fruit:

\[
5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0
\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."
"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to determine the number of each colored square and then calculate the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up the total number of squares:
- Total number of squares = Number of red squares + Number of blue squares + Number of green squares + Number of white squares
- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
- Total area = 68 square feet

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are currently available. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available is:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs are needed. The number of additional chairs required is the difference between the total number of chairs needed and the number of chairs currently available:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of additional chairs that need to be obtained is:

\[ 9 \]

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate how much she puts into her retirement account and how much she pays for her car payment, and then subtract these amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate how much she puts into her retirement account:
\[ \text{Retirement Contribution} = 50\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.50 \times \$2400.00 = \$1200.00 \]

Next, let's calculate how much she pays for her car payment:
\[ \text{Car Payment} = 20\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.20 \times \$2400.00 = \$480.00 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$2400.00 - \$1200.00 - \$480.00 = \$720.00 \]

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:

3. **Combined total taps:**
   - Total taps with both hands at her sides: 2750 taps
   - Total taps with arms raised: 800 taps
   - Combined total taps: \(2750 + 800 = 3550\) taps

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{3550}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes:
- Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \]

Next, we know that if the pothole is not fixed, it will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, let's add the number of normal chairs left and baby chairs left to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:
- Normal chairs left: 150
- Baby chairs left: 10
- Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five people:

\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:

\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat nine sausages is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. The average time is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time taken by cat} + \text{Time taken by dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of Topher's shoe as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed on the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:

- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000 people lined up at the polling station.

2. **People who voted by midday**:
   - 2/5 of the people had voted by midday.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \).

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Number of people remaining = 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \).

5. **People who had not voted by 16:00**:

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
Substituting the father's age:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of her French book:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the weight of her English book:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the weight of her history book. The problem states that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add up the weights of all the books to find the total weight:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]

Adding this to candidate A's votes:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. The votes received by candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes received by candidates A and B from the total votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to update the number of apples each person has after this exchange:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[
\text{Difference in apples} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how much water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, let's determine how much water Peter has left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water used = 30 ounces.
- Water left = 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is 2."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, Steven has:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]

Substituting the cost of a gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the overall total amount of money spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem:

- The total number of students is 50.
- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.
- The rest of the students like to play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as \( M \) and the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \).

According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play music, and play video games:
\[ 10 + 5 + M + V = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + 10 + V = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."

"To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing 80 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, we need to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. We need to divide these students into 12 groups of equal size.

To find the number of students per group, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, it indicates that 12 groups of equal size are not possible with 54 students. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, implying we need to find out how many groups are needed to accommodate all students.

To find out how many groups are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

\[
\frac{54}{4.5} = 12
\]

This calculation confirms that 12 groups are indeed needed to accommodate all 54 students if each group has 4.5 students.

Since the question asks for the number of additional groups needed to form, and we already have 12 groups, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[
12 - 12 = 0
\]

Thus, no additional groups are needed.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental numbers for weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekday rental: 60 chairs per day
- Weekend rental: 100 chairs per day

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total chairs rented during weekdays and weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays: \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs
- Total chairs rented during weekends: \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs

Finally, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."
"To determine how many bananas Gunther found in the pile, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas step by step.

1. **Initial number of bananas**: Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. **Arnold steals half**: Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas**: Gunther added 25 more bananas to the pile, so the number of bananas became:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas**: Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left was:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. **Gunther adds 6 bananas**: Gunther added 6 more bananas to the pile, so the number of bananas became:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Thus, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:
\[
\boxed{43}

Next, let's account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates that are still usable:

- The number of usable glasses is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- The number of usable plates is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, let's add the usable glasses and plates together to find the total number of usable items:

- Total usable items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

The final numerical answer is 128."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are traded for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - After trading 27 small stickers, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, 20 large stickers are traded for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, 20 large stickers are traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Total buttons = 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 80 buttons.

The final numerical answer is 80."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

Given that there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes cast is 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

2. Calculate the total number of hours for all songs:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 9/2:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Jayden initially had $70, and his sister gave him $45, so now Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, and Jayden now has $115. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as \( A \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 300 = 2A \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we are told that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. Ahmed read 150 books, and Ezra read 450 books. Adding these together gives:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back at the same speed, the time taken to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Total number of movies:** 600
2. **Movies in series:** 1/3 of 600 = 200
3. **Remaining movies:** 600 - 200 = 400
4. **Older movies:** 40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160
5. **Normal movies:** 400 - 160 = 240

Now, let's calculate the cost for each category:

1. **Cost of series movies:** Since a third of the movies are in series and he can get them for $6 each, the cost is 200 * $6 = $1200.
2. **Cost of older movies:** Older movies cost $5 each, so the cost is 160 * $5 = $800.
3. **Cost of normal movies:** Normal movies cost $10 each, so the cost is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Finally, let's sum up the costs:

Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ mph} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \text{ mph} - 5 \text{ mph} = 25 \text{ mph} - 5 \text{ mph} = 20 \text{ mph} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:

\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 30 points less than Emma for the timer. Let's denote the points Emma gets for the timer as \( T_E \). Then Ava gets \( T_E - 30 \) points for the timer. The scores for Ava and Emma can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_A + 5B_A + (T_E - 30) \]
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \]

Substituting \( E_A \) and \( B_A \) in terms of \( E_E \) and \( B_E \):

\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + (T_E - 30) = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + T_E - 30 = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65 \]
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \]

The difference in their scores is:

\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65) - (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E) = 65 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

\[ \boxed{65} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the combined cost of these two pizzas is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost of the four pizzas gives us the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the rides from the other days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify this equation:

\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):

\[ o = 17 - w \]

Substitute this expression for \( o \) into the second equation:

\[ 17 - w - 2w = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3w = 5 \]
\[ -3w = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3w = -12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o + w = 17 \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy drives from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - Total distance driven in a week is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of gas consumed in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - Therefore, the amount of gas consumed in a week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3/gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of the gas consumed in a week is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25
\]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has decided to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost, which is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing $100."
"First, let's determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. 

Given:
- The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
- The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day.

Calculate the temperature during the night:
\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of seashells brought back.

First, we need to find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to determine how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. We calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

So, 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie earned for her regular 8 hours of work and for the additional hours she worked.

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings:
- For the 8 regular hours: \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \)
- For the 3 additional hours: \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \)

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the hours played in the last week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car's speed is 60 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the first car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car's speed is 70 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the second car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:

\[
\text{Difference in distance} = \text{Distance traveled by the second car} - \text{Distance traveled by the first car} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

Total cost before premium = $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium:

Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost including premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many more candies he needs to sell to have all of his candy, we subtract the number of candies he already has from the total number of candies he ordered and received:

200 (total candies he has now) - 150 (candies he has already sold) = 50 candies.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

1. **Beginning of January:** 10 students
2. **End of January:** 10 * 2 = 20 students
3. **End of February:** 20 * 2 = 40 students
4. **End of March:** 40 * 2 = 80 students
5. **End of April:** 80 * 2 = 160 students
6. **End of May:** 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students by the end of May = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 60 branches per day."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

First, she picks:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Total petals picked: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

She drops 1 of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals

Total petals dropped: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Petals remaining in the vase: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they used 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows lost is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the 14 marshmallows left. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack and his two worse friends can each play for 20 minutes, while the better friend can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

The total play time for Jack and his two worse friends is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The better friend plays for 30 minutes. So, the total play time for all four friends is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for 4 hours, we convert 4 hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games} \]

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to multiply the number of each type of animal by its price and then add the totals together.

For the goats:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the totals:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he should buy, we can subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars and gives away 16 cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars he remains with is \(40 - 8 - 16 = 16\) cars.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, the number of hours she walked on the second day is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours Sandy walked over the two days. This is the sum of the hours she walked on the first day and the second day:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot at the start of the lunch break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. **Cars Remaining During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[

"To determine how much John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle}
   \]

   Now, the daily earnings are:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00/\text{day} = \$1260.00/\text{week}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:

\[
5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Milly will be refunded by Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate how much Milly will lose. She will lose the cost of the book plus the shipping cost, but she will only get a refund of 75% of the book's cost. Therefore, the total loss is:
\[ \$32 + \$3.00 - \$24.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has before making any purchases:

"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add the production from the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production in the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and calculate the time spent on each.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs each week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Over 4 weeks, the total time spent writing songs in a month is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup each week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Over 4 weeks, the total time spent on makeup in a month is:

"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs based on the items she needs installed.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:

- Additional mirrors: Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. At $15.00 per mirror, this will cost 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
- Additional chandeliers: Angela needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier. At $15.00 per chandelier, this will cost 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
- Additional pictures: Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures. At $15.00 per picture, this will cost 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the additional items to the base installation cost:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional items cost: $30.00 (mirrors) + $15.00 (chandeliers) + $150.00 (pictures) = $155.00

Total cost for Angela: $129.00 + $155.00 = $284.00

"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more money than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of the individuals step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours initially, which means he covers \(8 \times 4 = 32\) miles. After resting, he continues to travel for another 6 hours at the same rate, covering \(8 \times 6 = 48\) miles. Therefore, the total distance he has traveled is \(32 + 48 = 80\) miles. 

The final numerical answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total distance they travel as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Speed of one kangaroo} \times \text{Time} \times \text{Number of kangaroos} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \times 3 \]

Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \). Then the total distance is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 18v \times 3 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( 54v \) is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Speed of one turtle} \times \text{Number of turtles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2} \times 4} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54v}{2v \times 4} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54v}{8v} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{54}{8} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 6.75 \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 6.75 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6.75 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kora makes 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, to find the total number of clay dishes they all make together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 20 + 40 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 140 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to buy the laptop is $350, and she has $230, so the amount in her purse must be $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam slices 3 large apples:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam slices 5 small apples:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples together:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows. Each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows will provide:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows he needs, we first calculate the additional milk required:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Each additional cow will provide 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 of its length left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the glue that is not used is 2 millimeters.

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 of its length left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the glue that is not used is 8 millimeters.

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 of its length left:
   \[
   \text{Length left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the glue that is not used is 6 millimeters.

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Gabriel has a total of $5000 from working on weekends plus $200 from his brother, which sums up to $5200. The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800. Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

The final numerical answer is $19."
"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Next, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts without collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

The difference is:

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. Since there are 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

- Initial number of goats in Farm X: 55
- Initial number of goats in Farm Y: 45
- Number of goats sold from Farm X: 10
- Number of goats sold from Farm Y: 2 * 10 = 20

Now, let's subtract the sold goats from the initial number of goats:

- Remaining goats in Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45
- Remaining goats in Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms:

- Total remaining goats: 45 + 25 = 70

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs bought in a year:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the discount per basket is $2.
- Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Adding these together, we get:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote my age as \( x \). 

Given:
- I am three years younger than my brother, so my brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
- I am two years older than my sister, so my sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

The sum of our ages is 87:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide by 6:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than 54, Mr. Jackson will have 56 - 54 = 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water on the first day:** 4000 gallons.
2. **Amount of water on the second day:** The amount doubles from the first day, so it becomes \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons.
3. **Amount of water on the third day:** The amount increases by 6000 gallons from the second day, so it becomes \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the number of badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year, which is 12 months, Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

"Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

In one hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so in total, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised in cents is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total amount raised in dollars is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 12 red cars.
- There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
- There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(10 \times 3 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Adding these up gives us the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn's \, books = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is:

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after the third day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
26 - 14 = 12 \text{ pieces}

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens:
\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the remaining glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

\[
\text{Money left after selling the rope} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Sarah has no money left after selling the original rope, she cannot buy any new rope. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. We can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bacon} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of bacon} + \text{Total cost of chicken} + \text{Total cost of strawberries} + \text{Total cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 196 = -131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the items. She is short by:
\[
\text{Shortage} = 196 - 65 = 131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}

"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
- There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, the number of birds flying overhead is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, the number of birds feeding is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, let's add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

The final numerical answer is 34."

"To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \( 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \( 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \( 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \).

So, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise:
- His original hourly wage was $10.
- The raise was $2 per hour.
- Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:
- He works 8 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we calculate his total weekly earnings:
- His new hourly wage is $12.
- He works 40 hours in a week.
- Therefore, his total weekly earnings are $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 3x \) lawns for Kamala.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 5x \) lawns for Alba.

The total number of lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( 6 \times 9x = 54x \).

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns is $54x, and the earnings from lemonade sales is \( 80 - 54x \).

To find \( x \), we need to determine the value that makes \( 54x \) a reasonable amount, considering \( x \) must be a positive integer. Since \( 54x \) must be less than or equal to $80, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 54x \leq 80 \]
\[ x \leq \frac{80}{54} \]
\[ x \leq \frac{40}{27} \approx 1.48 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( x \) is 1. If \( x = 1 \), then:

\[ 54x = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]

So, the earnings from lemonade sales would be:

\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \( 26 \)."

Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 per hour, so:

30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from the total earnings:

$750 (total earnings) - $500 (car payment) = $250

So, the profit John makes on his car is $250."

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls. This means the pot can fill 8 child's bowls (since 4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls).

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. Each person will have one bowl of soup. Therefore, 4 bowls of soup will be consumed in total.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and only 4 bowls are needed, there will be 4 bowls of soup left over.

Each child can have one bowl of soup, and since there are 2 children, each child can have one bowl of soup. Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:

Next, we need to calculate how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday, he completes:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:
\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he drinks:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Thus, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

6"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups by dividing the total miles driven by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's break down the expenses and the money they spent:

1. **Cake Cost**: $11
2. **Balloons Cost**: 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. **Ice Cream Cost**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received:
- $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

- Tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.
- Volleyball: There are twice the number of students playing tennis, so there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, let's add up the total number of students playing all the sports:

- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Total number of students = 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's sum up all his pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and then find the number of cups of mint tea in each row.

First, let's determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups of tea in total. Since the cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( 4.5 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, given that he needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, we know that the sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This means that in 4 hours, the sloth makes one trip. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make two trips.

If the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes two trips in that time, then the number of berries he picks up per trip is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of berries per trip} = \frac{\text{Total number of berries}}{\text{Number of trips}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries per trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total cost for popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total cost for candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from the total money he has:
- Colby has $150 initially.
- After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, he has \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars left.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10 per movie. We need to find out how many $10 tickets he can buy with $126:
- The number of movies he can see is \( \frac{126}{10} = 12.6 \).

Since he can only see whole movies, we take the integer part of the division, which is 12.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories from all the pastries:
- Total calories = \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance the bus travels is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance the car travels is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Q + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Q = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Q + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[
Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:

"Cameron's stay is from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. 

First, we calculate the cost for the first 12 hours:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours):
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for Cameron's stay:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

The hotel's standard 24-hour rate is 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount Cameron would save by choosing the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Fee**: $40
2. **Labor Cost**: $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since labor is charged per hour, we need to round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we sum these up:
- Visit Fee: $40
- Labor Cost: $105
- Parts Cost: $60

Total Charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

Therefore, Patty charged **$205**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for them:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money James was out is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, I'll multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, I'll add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining distance}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"First, let's calculate seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from this number to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has:

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 

\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so she has:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission from New York Times sales is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission from Wall Street Journal sales is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Adding the two commissions together gives the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, if Marcus is 21, Leo's age is:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in one inch:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \text{ pages} \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate the total number of reports he stapled.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Convert hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of this sleepwalking period is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time she woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before this (from 6:00 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.) is:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5:55 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 24 cups. According to the problem, Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Now, we need to account for the additional patients admitted over the course of 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Adding these 700 patients to the initial 200 occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement made by Courtney. 

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). 

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]
This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]
Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but then they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in 2 holes:
\[29 - 2 = 27\]

According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Since there were 27 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 27 = 13\]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{13}

"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number Amora and Lainey received, we can write:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We sum the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the cost of travel, we first need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. The cost of supplies is $400.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode. It is also stated that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we can write:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. **Nani's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Brother's age**: Twice Nani's age.
   \[
   \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. **Sister's age**: 25% younger than Nani.
   - First, find 25% of Nani's age:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of Nani's age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Cherries**: There are 60 cherries in total.
2. **Robert's Cherries**: Robert has 30 cherries.
3. **Richard's Cherries**: Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
4. **Jerry's Cherries**: To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries. So, Jerry has \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Saturday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
   - Apple Pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

2. **Sunday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes

"To find the cost of the red car, we first calculate 40% of the price of the blue car:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:

\[ \$60 + \$100 = \$160 \]

Thus, the total cost of both cars is:

\[ \$160 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's dad's current age as \( D \) and his brother's current age as \( B \).

First, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When Emil turns 24, the time elapsed will be 24 - 19 = 5 years.

At that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \). According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that at the same time (when Emil is 24), Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ B = 12 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

- Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne received:

\[
20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90
\]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower growth. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:

\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, each plant (including the space between them) takes up:

\[ 12 \text{ inches (flower)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her 1332-inch flower bed:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ new plants} \]

Each new plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many, so:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 3 \text{ petunias/basket} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{sweet potato vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total amount Katherine will spend:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for roses is:
- Remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
- Number of roses = Remaining soil for roses = 3.

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - No change in temperature
   - Temperature change: \(0 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 0 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the temperature changes:
- Total temperature change: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} + 0 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)

The room started at a certain temperature, and after the air conditioner's operation, the room temperature decreased by 18 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age difference between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- Bill's father was 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years (since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years).

Therefore, the age difference between Bill's first and second sightings is:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \text{ years} \]

This 60-year difference represents the time interval between the first and second sightings. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the first sighting must have occurred 15 years before the second sighting (since 75 years - 60 years = 15 years).

Given that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:

\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves' howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam's trousers cost $30. Therefore, the total amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is the cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents.

So, Adam's contribution is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

- \(A = 3\)
- \(B = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

Next, Walter's friend gives him an additional $200:

Total collected now: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund:

Total collected from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000

The lawyer's donation is three times this amount:

Lawyer's donation: 3 * $2000 = $6000

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice in relation to the others.

Let's denote the total number of slices of the watermelon as \( S \).

Given that the family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide the watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following relationship:

- Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
- Then, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices can be expressed as:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total number of slices \( S \) is \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \( 2x \) slices, and the total number of slices is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of slices each adult gets}}{\text{Total number of slices}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds from minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed and variable costs, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is 3 days/session * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480/month.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[
4p = 64
\]
\[
7m = 56
\]

Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Solving for \( m \):
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, let's calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are approximately 7.48052 gallons in a cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by the conversion factor:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48052 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472.728 \]

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water are needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 10472.728 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 62,044.4132 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 62,044.4132 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 6204.44132 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost to fill the pool is approximately $6204.44."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Given that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

\[ \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Matteo}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Shandy}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students over 16 years old is \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students under 16 years old is also \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students over 16 years old is \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \).

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students over 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \).

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students under 16 years old is \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \).

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students under 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \).

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - The total number of female students is the sum of female students over 16 years old and female students under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total number of female students is \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \).

The final numerical answer is 1875."
"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{(0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3} \]

Let's calculate the values of \((0.91)^5\) and \((0.93)^3\):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

Now, multiply these values:
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \approx 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

Finally, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 each = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. She bought a box containing 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne kept two packs for herself. Let's calculate the number of pieces she kept:

\[
2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets she gave to her 10 friends. We subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:

\[
900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[
\frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend}
\]

Thus, each of her friends received:

\[
78 \text{ pieces}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{78}

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual rate of increase.
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. This means each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies and portraits can be calculated as follows:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

- Number of portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the two quantities together:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

1. **Early Checkouts:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests}
   \]

2. **Late Checkouts:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests}
   \]

3. **Guests Checking In:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests}
   \]
   Adding these guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

The total number of questions is 60. 

- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions.
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions.

Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we have:
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18 questions.
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct.

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she gets correct is:
  75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.

- Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she gets correct is:
  50% of (18 + 18) = 0.50 * 36 = 18 questions.

Now, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Easy questions: 18
- Average questions: 9 (half of 18)
- Difficult questions: 9 (half of 18)

Total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \). The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves mine \( 40 \times 18 = 720 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - The total ore mined in a month is \( 720 \times 30 = 21600 \) pounds.

Thus, the total pounds of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month is:

\[

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Initially, there were 25 red balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of them to burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. Initially, there were 12 yellow balloons. Half of them were released:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

The combined probability of not having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is the sum of the probabilities of not getting an extension and not convincing the teacher:
\[ 60\% + 80\% = 140\% \]
However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to correct this by recognizing that the 60% and 80% are mutually exclusive events in this context. Therefore, the probability of not having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is 100% (since the 60% and 80% cover all possibilities).

Thus, the probability of having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is:
\[ 100\% - 100\% = 0\% \]

Now, combining the probabilities from both scenarios:
- Probability of having to turn in the homework with a substitute teacher: 50%
- Probability of having to turn in the homework with the normal teacher: 0%

The overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is:
\[ 50\% + 0\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This is calculated by subtracting the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

Total tickets to be distributed = Total capacity - Seats reserved for graduates - Seats reserved for faculty
Total tickets to be distributed = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats

Now, we need to split these 4750 tickets equally among the 950 graduates.

Tickets per graduate = Total tickets to be distributed / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950

Let's calculate this:
Tickets per graduate = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans he can eat, we need to determine how many sets of 3 small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.
   - Since 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, 150 medium-sized beans are equivalent to:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:

6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from jury duty:

$15/day * 3 days = $45

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:

$3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, let's find out her net earnings after expenses:

$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:

$36 / 18 hours = $2/hour

So, the final numerical answer is $2 per hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at $16 each:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is:

\[ 66 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 66 \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, the total number of trips he will make is 7.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time for all the trips is:
\[
7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds per trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To solve this, first, we need to find out the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples he can make with the total of 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds:
\[ 11 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 2 \text{ pounds} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Amor buys 3 pounds:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the total cost of the cheese:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income during college. Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job. During college, his income tripled, so his income became:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

However, he did not work during his 4 years of college, so the income lost is the difference between his pre-college income and his income during college:

\[ 75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time, including the time spent in college. His total income over the 4 years of college would be the sum of his pre-college income and the income during college:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 + 75,000 \times 4 = 100,000 + 300,000 = 400,000 \]

The total amount of money he borrowed is $200,000. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn to cover both the loan repayment and the income lost is:

\[ 200,000 + 200,000 = 400,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year during college, we need to determine how many years it would take to earn $400,000. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount needed by his annual income:

\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since he cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. **Length of each piece of fabric:**
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Width of each piece of fabric:**
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}
   \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, Jim needs to buy:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered over the three days:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3

Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.1667}

"To find the total population in South America, we can multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities per country * Number of people per city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000

Now, let's calculate the total population:

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000 = 130,000

So, the total population in South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, we need to determine the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours they worked. They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total hours worked over 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. Since there are 4 painters, the total hours each painter worked is:
\[ \frac{\frac{63}{8} \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = \frac{63}{8 \times 4} \text{ hours/painter} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours/painter} \]

To convert this to a decimal:
\[ \frac{63}{32} \approx 1.96875 \text{ hours/painter} \]

Therefore, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1.96875 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need to combine the terms involving \( x \). To do this, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, Rory retrieved \(\boxed{10}\) tennis balls in the first set."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The depreciation rate is 21% per year, which means the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
\[ \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the car in 2009:
\[ \text{Price in 2009} = \text{Price in 2008} \times 0.79 = (20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79 \]

Finally, we calculate the price of the car in 2010:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = \text{Price in 2009} \times 0.79 = ((20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79) \times 0.79 \]

We can simplify this calculation by recognizing that:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, let's compute the numerical value:
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.624159 \]

So,
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.624159 = 12483.18 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{12483.18} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the 50 books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is:

\[

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train accordingly.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Additionally, twice the number of people who disembarked (which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)) board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people after boarding} = 90 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the additional cost as follows:

\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin beds}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king bed}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
  \]

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
\[
2 \text{ loads (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ load (king bed)} = 3 \text{ loads}
\]

Since Greg does this every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
\[
52 \text{ weeks in a year}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of loads Greg does in a year:
\[
3 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 156 \text{ loads/year}

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

So, in one weekend, they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

So, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit itself and then add the cost of the cast and the painkillers.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. Therefore, the cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many emails James doesn't respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails don't require any response, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

This means that the number of emails James responds to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum up all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- First 3 tests: 100 each
- 4th test: 80

First, calculate the total sum of the scores:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 4):
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left:

The total number of pizzas left is the sum of the pizzas left for the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional ones is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

However, two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver. So, the number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Since each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, we consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.
- To find out how many sets of 2 pounds are in 6 pounds, we divide 6 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{6}{2} = 3
  \]
- Dennis will pay for 3 pounds of butter.

Now, we calculate the cost for 3 pounds of butter:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Therefore, the cost for 3 pounds is:
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12
  \]

Thus, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come: 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest beyond 20. Therefore, the additional guests are:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Cost for additional guests: 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final numerical answer is:

$251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it. So, the amount Maggie spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Therefore, the amount Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it. So, the amount Riza spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Therefore, the amount Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, Jenny needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. She will use the $25 she has to pay for the roses and will be left with:

\[ \$25 - \$30 = -\$5 \]

This means Jenny is $5 short, and she needs to pay the remaining $5. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive in change. Since she needs $5 in quarters, we calculate the number of quarters as follows:

\[ \$5 = 5 \times \$0.25 = 5 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 125 \text{ cents} = 125 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny will receive 125 quarters in change. The number of quarters she leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{125} \]"

   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she buys the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she buys the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

Thus, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."

   - In 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - The net number of bales is the number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up.
   - Net bales = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour workday is 12."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in classes and the additional time he spends learning on weekends.

First, let's determine the total number of periods John has to attend each day:
- A normal student has 6 periods.
- John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the time spent in class each day is:
\[ 8 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the time spent in class each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on weekends for extra learning. The total weekly minutes are:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

So, the time spent on weekends for extra learning is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we add the time spent in class and the time spent on weekends:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \]"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 72 \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. 

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means:

\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

3. Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. Therefore, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = $20,000 \).

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = $40,000 \).

Now, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years of retirement:
- She plans to retire in 20 years.
- She needs to save enough to cover her living expenses of $40,000 per year for 20 years.
- Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is \( 40,000 \times 20 = $800,000 \).

Finally, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 each year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan. 

The final numerical answer is 40 years."

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \).

Given that 40% of \( N \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ N = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in June and the total number of days in June.

June has 30 days. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Let's calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike in June based on her plan:

\[ \text{Total miles per day} = 125 \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]
\[ \text{Total miles in June} = 250 \times 30 = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles in June, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to reach her goal. The difference in the total miles she needs to hike and the total miles she plans to hike is:

\[ \text{Additional miles needed} = 9300 - 7500 = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:

\[ \text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time: \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than 4 hours. Let's denote Dior's time as \( D \).
   - Given that Dior's time is well over 4 hours, we can assume \( D > 4 \) hours. For simplicity, let's assume the minimum value greater than 4 hours, which is 5 hours. However, since the problem states ""well over 4 hours,"" we can assume a value greater than 4 but less than 5 for Dior's time, say 5.5 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 5.5 hours

Total time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 5.5 \text{ hours} = 15.5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Adding the toys produced by all four workers, we get \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 200 toys have been produced. Therefore, the manufacturer still needs \(400 - 200 = 200\) toys to be able to ship the order.

Since the fifth worker is also working for a 10-hour shift, let's denote the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour as \(x\). Over 10 hours, the fifth worker will produce \(10x\) toys.

The total number of toys produced by all five workers is \(200 + 10x\). Since the total order is 400 toys, we have:

\[200 + 10x = 400\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[10x = 200\]
\[x = 20\]

So, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, so the remaining stickers Kris received and gave to Rob were \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 \).
4. Kris gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob, so \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \).

Now, we solve for \( S \):

\[
\frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
S = 64
\]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. 

\[
\boxed{64}

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms he has in total. Given that each ounce contains 30 M&Ms:

- The total number of M&Ms is \(30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms}\).

Now, if John puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

- The number of small bags is \( \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms/bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags}\).

So, the final numerical answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:

\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:

\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam's age two years ago: \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \(V\). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[14 = 2V\]

Solving for \(V\):

\[V = \frac{14}{2} = 7\]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[7 + 2 = 9\]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of each box (which contains 8 crayons and weighs 8 ounces) is:

\[ \text{Total weight of each box} = 8 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 8 \text{ ounces (box)} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the boxes. Since there are 25 boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of all boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 16 \text{ ounces/box} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Given that there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can get is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 45000 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 45000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, the time spent on the beach is given by:
\[ \text{Time on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{2}{v} \text{ minutes} \]
We are given that this time is 40 minutes:
\[ \frac{2}{v} = 40 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we know that Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]
Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and sum them up:

- 3 trees each had 7 blue birds: \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds
- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds
- 1 final tree had 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Adding these together gives the total number of blue birds:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Bob currently has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. After pouring, the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the second mug is \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce is poured from the 5-ounce mug).

The final temperature of the water in his water bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. Since he has 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( \frac{T}{5} \) degree water, the final temperature \( F \) is given by:

\[ F = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times \frac{T}{5}}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + \frac{T}{5}}{5} = \frac{660 + T}{25} \]

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need:

\[ \frac{660 + T}{25} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 25, we get:

\[ 660 + T \geq 1000 \]

Subtracting 660 from both sides, we get:

\[ T \geq 340 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 340 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{340} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - Three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

3. **Number of cows added per day:**
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day

4. **Number of chickens added per day:**
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day

5. **Total number of cows added in three weeks:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

6. **Total number of chickens added in three weeks:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

7. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Applying the 10% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted total cost} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total number of bagels in 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[
3 - 1 = 2
\]

So, 2 potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Given that 2 potatoes make 1 less than 3 scoops, we can determine the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop by dividing 2 by 2:

\[
\frac{2}{2} = 1
\]

Therefore, 1 potato makes 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we multiply the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop by 18:

\[
18 \times 1 = 18
\]

Thus, Gomer ate 18 potatoes. 

\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can start by calculating the number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he collects from each tree over the course of 10 years and then multiply that by the number of trees he grows.

Each tree gives 6 lemons per year. Over a decade (10 years), each tree will give:

\[ 6 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons} \]

Tim grows 5 trees, so the total number of lemons he gets in a decade is:

\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 252 \]"

"To determine the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. Therefore, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from the number of seashells Jim collected:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person got \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19 \frac{2}{3}} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can break it down by days:

- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.

So, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

The total number of carrots eaten on Saturday and Sunday is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + (0.60 \times 5) \]

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, the selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price:
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
The total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Since he sold each of the 6 devices for $40, the total revenue is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus was able to earn is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each person needs 5 bottles.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The additional number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to 1 for practical purposes)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
- Number of babies wearing bows and purple: 2
- Total number of babies wearing bows: 3

The percentage chance is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final numerical answer is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham initially owned. He owns 80 square meters of unused land.

He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

The price per square meter for the first sale is:
\[ \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

The price per square meter for the second sale is:
\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from the first two sales:
- Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \text{ square meters} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 50 \text{ dollars} \)
- Revenue from the second sale: \( 20 \text{ square meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \)

Total revenue from the first two sales:
\[ 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining land after the first two sales is:
\[ 80 \text{ square meters} - 40 \text{ square meters} - 20 \text{ square meters} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
\[ 20 \text{ square meters} \times 3 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total money Abraham will earn after selling all his land is:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- He goes out three times a day.

So, the number of times he changes his face mask in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ times/mask} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ times/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times he changes his face mask in 2 days:
\[ 6 \text{ times/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times} \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs.

Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found by all of them is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\).

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\).

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of garbage collections per week is:
- \(1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections}\).

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his weekly earnings are:
- \(3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:

\[

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5. \]

And the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Ronnie received $5, so the total amount of money Rissa had initially was $15.

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) (since they are equal):
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2."
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the total area of the house is the sum of the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house. The remaining area is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48

Let's add these numbers step by step:
3 + 6 = 9
9 + 12 = 21
21 + 24 = 45
45 + 48 = 93

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, we can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
240

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the goals scored by each team in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

Next, we calculate the goals scored by each team in the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, we sum up the goals scored by each team in the entire match:
- Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)

Finally, we find the total number of goals scored in the match by adding the goals scored by both teams:
\[6 + 10 = 16\]

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The chalk piece was 5 inches long.
   - Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The remaining chalk is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Determine the amount of chalk used each subsequent day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is 2.75 inches.
   - The chalk used on Tuesday is \( 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Tuesday is \( 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \) inches.

4. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk has to be recycled:**
   - The teacher will continue using 20% of the remaining chalk each day until the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches.
   - We need to find the number of days \( n \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches.
   - The remaining chalk after \( n \) days can be calculated as \( 2.75 \times (0.80)^n \).
   - We need to solve for \( n \) in the inequality \( 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \).

Let's solve this inequality:

\[
2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2
\]

Divide both sides by 2.75:

\[
(0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln((0.80)^n) < \ln(0.7273)
\]

Using the property of logarithms \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\):

\[
n \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.7273)
\]

Since \(\ln(0.80)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.80)\) and reverse the inequality:

\[
n > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.80)}
\]

Calculate the values:

\[
\ln(0.7273) \approx -0.310
\]
\[
\ln(0.80) \approx -0.223
\]

So,

\[
n > \frac{-0.310}{-0.223} \approx 1.39
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:

\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

The number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students} \]

1. Mike bought 5 face masks.
2. Johnny bought \(3 \times 5 + 2\) face masks.

Now, let's do the calculation:

\[
3 \times 5 = 15
\]
\[
15 + 2 = 17
\]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

James has 30 teeth in total.

The dentist drills 4 teeth.
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
50

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk sold.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that was returned.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased.
\[
\text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is based on the cost of the returned milk.
\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \left(3 + 0.5\right) = 1600 \times 3 + 1600 \times 0.5 = 4800 + 800 = \$5600
\]

Thus, the refund amount is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations.

For Wendy's current age:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

For the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. 

To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ books}}{500 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{x \text{ books}}{27000 \text{ dollars}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \times 27000}{500} \]

\[ x = \frac{2700000}{500} \]

\[ x = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, Bob has $27,000 to distribute among 3 schools. To find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} \]

\[ \text{Books per school} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas are required to meet these consumption needs.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, for these three days, he ran:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, he ran:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from both sets of days together:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3.33 \]"
"If John is 28 years old now, and when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's age at that time:

Let \( J_d \) be John's age when Digimon came out, and \( J_i \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out. According to the problem, \( J_d = 2 \times J_i \).

Given that John is 28 years old now, the difference in their ages is 28 years. If we let \( x \) be the number of years since Digimon came out, then:

\[ J_d = 28 - x \]
\[ J_i = \frac{28 - x}{2} \]

Since \( J_d = 2 \times J_i \), we can substitute \( J_d \) and \( J_i \) with the expressions above:

\[ 28 - x = 2 \times \frac{28 - x}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 28 - x = 28 - x \]

This equation is true for all \( x \), which means the relationship holds true for any \( x \). However, we need to find Jim's age when Digimon came out, which is \( J_i \). Since \( J_d = 28 - x \) and \( J_d = 2 \times J_i \), we can directly find \( J_i \):

\[ J_i = \frac{28 - x}{2} \]

Since \( x \) is the number of years since Digimon came out, and we are looking for Jim's age at that time, we can conclude:

\[ J_i = \frac{28 - x}{2} \]

Given that John is 28 now, and the relationship holds true, we can directly find Jim's age at that time by recognizing that when Digimon came out, John was half of Jim's age. Therefore, if John is 28 now, he was 14 when Digimon came out, meaning Jim was 7 at that time.

So, Jim is 7 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which means she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices. 

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add up the slices each of them ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had 12 bandages left (50 - 38 = 12).
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have 12 + 50 = 62 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had 62 - 28 = 34 bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have 34 - 28 = 6 bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had 6 + 100 - 25 = 81 bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used 81 - 78 = 3 bandages more than they needed to, which is consistent with the half pack they ordered.

Now, to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we look at the bandages they had at the end of the first day before ordering more:
- They had 62 bandages at the end of the first day.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was initially 10 inches long and ended at 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is:

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not miss any days in April, she receives this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Adding her regular pay and the bonus together gives her total earnings for April:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

Therefore, Jen will receive:
\[ \$310.00 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

1. For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each laundry task. So, he earned $3.00.
2. For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each cleaning task. So, he earned $1.50.
3. For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each trash task. So, he earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
4. For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each emptying task. So, he earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
$3.00 (from laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning room) + $1.50 (from taking trash) + $3.00 (from emptying dishwasher) = $9.00.

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in a single shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered the restaurant.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered the restaurant.

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Total number of fish in the tank:** 66

2. **Number of fish with red stripes:**
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Therefore, the number of fish with red stripes is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

3. **Remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish:**
   - The remaining fish are \( 66 - 22 = 44 \).

4. **Number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Therefore, the number of fish with blue stripes is \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

5. **Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - The fish with red stripes and blue stripes are counted in both groups.
   - We need to find the overlap, which is the number of fish that have both red and blue stripes.
   - The total number of fish with red stripes is 22, and the total number of fish with blue stripes is 20.
   - Therefore, the number of fish with both red and blue stripes is \( 22 + 20 - 66 = 2 \).

Thus, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 2.

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one makeup set. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor itself, which is 240 inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

"First, let's calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is 168."

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed over the specified periods:

- For the low setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the low setting is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters}
  \]

- For the medium setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the medium setting is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters}
  \]

- For the high setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days. Therefore, the total water removed on the high setting is:
  \[
  5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters}
  \]

Finally, we sum up the total amount of water removed over all the settings:
\[
3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"First, let's calculate the total number of balloons they initially had:

10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

So, the final numerical answer is 288."
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi had to combine with the first medicine for one dose. 

The first medicine amount is 14 mL. The second medicine amount is 3 times the first medicine amount, which is:
\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

So, for one dose, the total amount of medicine is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of Ali's and John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.
2. Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months.
3. Calculate the remaining amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen will owe.**

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months.**

Stephen will pay $25 per month for the first 11 months. The total amount paid over these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.**

The remaining amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he owes minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many Jordan changes.

First, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan makes per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar is:
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the estimated and true number is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered the bus at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers on the bus after the first stop**: 20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60 people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered the bus at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the number who entered at the first stop = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop**: 60 (after first stop) + 30 (second stop) = 90 people.
6. **Number of passengers on the bus after the third stop**: Doubled the number of passengers after the second stop = \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
7. **Bus capacity**: 200 people.
8. **Remaining capacity on the bus**: 200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of passengers) = 20 people.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, calculate the cost of one visit after the increase:
- The original cost of one visit is $2.
- The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost.
- 150% of $2 is \(0.15 \times 2 = 0.30\).
- Therefore, the new cost of one visit is \(2 + 0.30 = 2.30\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:
- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- In 5 years, she visits the museum \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
- The total cost for the first 5 years is \(15 \times 2.30 = 34.50\) dollars.

Then, calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:
- In the next 3 years, she visits the museum \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
- The total cost for the next 3 years is \(9 \times 2.30 = 20.70\) dollars.

Finally, add the costs from both periods to find the total amount spent:
- The total amount spent is \(34.50 + 20.70 = 55.20\) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{55.20}

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group spends.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students.

2. **Number of students per group:**
   - Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.

3. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Total students = 30
   - Students per group = 8
   - Number of groups = 30 students / 8 students/group = 3.75 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, 4 groups are needed.

4. **Time each group spends:**
   - Each group spends 45 minutes.

5. **Total time required:**
   - Number of groups = 4
   - Time per group = 45 minutes
   - Total time = 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. 

The final numerical answer is 180 minutes."

So, the final numerical answer is $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \):

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of meat needed:**
   Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the amount of meat required as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning required is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Amount of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."

"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we first need to calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday and then add 1 inch to that amount.

Given that it rained 2 inches on Monday, we can calculate the expected rain for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Rain on Monday} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times 2 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 5 \]

So, the number of inches of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify this by calculating the number of brownies:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This matches the requirement that there are 10 treats in total. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these two costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional charges:

\[
35 + 40 = 75
\]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if Karen gets both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[
0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price for both services:

\[
75 - 15 = 60

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the services:

\[
60 + 30 = 90
\]

Thus, Karen would pay a total of:

\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine is counted as one unit, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November is $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for veteran lessons.

"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 of them:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

Subtract the 9 apples given to his sister from the remaining 36 apples:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. We calculate the total money he received:

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 \times 24 \times 3 \, \text{km} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. 

Next, her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. Therefore, the number of grapes used by her brother is:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Let \( x \) be the total number of grapes at the beginning. We know that the grapes used by Madeline and her brother plus the grapes used to make the pies equal the total number of grapes:
\[ 36 + 48 = x \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[ x = 84 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours since the workday is measured in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculation. The time spent cleaning is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours, so the correct percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

This indicates that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, which is not possible in reality. The correct interpretation should be that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, but realistically, they would need to work more than one day to complete the task. 

Given the constraints of the question, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 250\% \]"
"Let's break down the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell. Since she sells 3 eggs for $1, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

Number of sets = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Finally, let's calculate her total revenue from selling the eggs. Since she sells each set of 3 eggs for $1:

Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

To find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. So, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in the four years is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he ended up with 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given ratios.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:
200"
"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. Therefore, the number of additional flashlights is:

\[ 2 \text{ flashlights/room} \times 8 \text{ rooms} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Adding the flashlights for the people and the flashlights for the rooms, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ flashlights} + 16 \text{ flashlights} = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of these rooms (4 rooms) have small candles, while the other half (4 rooms) have medium candles. Each small candle provides light for half a room, and each medium candle provides light for a full room. Therefore, the number of small candles needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ small candles/room} = 8 \text{ small candles} \]

The number of medium candles needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 1 \text{ medium candle/room} = 4 \text{ medium candles} \]

Adding the small and medium candles together, we get:

\[ 8 \text{ small candles} + 4 \text{ medium candles} = 12 \text{ candles} \]

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles:

\[ 20 \text{ flashlights} + 12 \text{ candles} = 32 \]

So, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine how many chips each person gets, we first need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has. He bought two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips.

First, we calculate the total number of chips:
\[
2 \text{ bags} \times 55 \text{ chips per bag} = 110 \text{ chips}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of chips equally among the five family members. We do this by dividing the total number of chips by the number of family members:
\[
110 \text{ chips} \div 5 \text{ family members} = 22 \text{ chips per person}
\]

Thus, each person gets:
\[
\boxed{22}

1. **First side**: John takes 5 minutes.
2. **Second side**: John takes twice as long as the first side, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. **Third side**: John also takes twice as long as the first side, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. **Fourth side**: John takes half as long as the first side, which is \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. **Fifth side**: John takes half as long as the first side, which is \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the times for all sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots. 

If Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, then there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish:
- The difference in drying time is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry as compared to the old varnish."
"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants:
\[ 20 \text{ plants} - 12 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants} \]

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel half the distance on land and the other half in water.

First, we determine the total distance Phineas needs to travel, which is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part:

- Distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each part of the distance.

- Time to hop on land: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to swim in water:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the time for both parts to find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home:

\[
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"To determine the cost for Bob to buy the popsicle sticks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, and Bob needs 7 boxes, so we multiply 7 by $2.00:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00.

\[
\boxed{14}

"Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs \( 2x \).

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ \text{Cost of main phone} + \text{Cost of four additional phones} = 20 + 4 \times 10 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, he makes:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

Therefore, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

For the blouses:
5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00

For the pants:
2 pairs of pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00

For the skirt:
1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Now, we add these amounts to find the weekly cost:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Finally, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the cost over 5 weeks:
$47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \, \text{minutes} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which means he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, which means he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days:
\[50 + 70 + 140 = 260\]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day for the entire week was 60. Since there are 6 days in the week, the total number of people Conor saw over the week is:
\[60 \times 6 = 360\]

We already know the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days, so the total number of people he saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is:
\[360 - 260 = 100\]

Since the average number of people seen each day is 60, and the total for the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is 100, the number of people seen each day on these days is:
\[100 \div 3 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33\]

However, we don't need the exact number for each day on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days to find the total for the week. We already calculated the total for the week as 360.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[
\boxed{360}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 2 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** 3 times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds:** 4 times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(0.5 \times 8 = 4\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 2 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 20 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. Since 4 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that number is:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the total amount of lemon juice Tim needs for 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 4 gallons will require:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to account for the extra gallon that is twice as tart. This extra gallon will also require 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 5 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 5 cups is:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim needs is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to find out how much food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume daily, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Weekly consumption = \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the equation to find the number of red blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Number of pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

The final numerical answer is 43."
"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night is $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the bus travels. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs for the hotel and the bus travels:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them.

Dallas starts with 21 marbles after dropping 4:
\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ends up with 17 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is:
\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles given to Darla. Since Dallas received 17 marbles, the total number of marbles given to Darla and Dallas is:
\[ x + 17 = 35 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 35 - 17 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Thus, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the cost for the adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the cost for the child ticket is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the tickets is \(24 + 8 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns to find the total amount paid:
- The total cost is \(32 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
38"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 75 \text{ pounds} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total weight:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

\[ 0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force needed to push the car is:

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds per pig per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over a week (7 days), the total feed consumption is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs left over} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs are required. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of additional hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has planned to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals planned to distribute:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the time spent each day and then multiply by the number of days in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation in the morning: 15 minutes
- Meditation before sleep: 15 minutes
- Total meditation time per day: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each day:
- Yoga practice: 1 hour (60 minutes)

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga each day:
- Total daily practice time: 30 (meditation) + 60 (yoga) = 90 minutes

Since Charisma practices 5 days a week, we calculate the weekly practice time:
- Weekly practice time: 90 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 450 minutes/week

Finally, we calculate the total time spent over 4 weeks:
- Total time over 4 weeks: 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% off the original price, which is $8 * 0.50 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $16.

So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
Revenue from 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

Next, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School enrollment} - \text{Butler High School enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1000 \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: Half as many as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Petri dishes: Two more than the number requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- Beakers: The correct number, which is 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Total gathered items:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost some items. Let's determine how many items he lost:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Thus, Igor lost 2 items. Since he gathered 7 beakers and placed 7 beakers on the lab bench, the 2 lost items must be from the test tubes and Petri dishes.

To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to check if the lost items are beakers. Since he gathered 7 beakers and placed 7 beakers, he did not lose any beakers. Therefore, the lost items must be from the test tubes and Petri dishes.

Since the total lost items are 2, and he gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, the only way to lose 2 items is if he lost 1 test tube and 1 Petri dish.

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
- James is putting together 4 tables.
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:
- \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is 8."
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs. 

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each girl raised individually.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each girl to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts together:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

\[
\boxed{2180}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Aaron's distance: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa:**
   - Let's denote Vanessa's speed as \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) miles per minute.
   - Given that Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes, we can use the formula for speed: \( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \).
   - For Aaron: \( 2v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - Solving for \( v \): \( 2v = \frac{2}{16} \), so \( v = \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's time to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( v = \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Using the formula for time: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - For Vanessa: \( \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of line needed for the docks. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy. He currently has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 594 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total revenue per night and then multiply by the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine per night:
- Cost of 2 meals: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of 1 bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per night: $10 + $5 = $15

Now, we know that the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and they make $15 in profit per night. So, the total revenue per night is $15.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue for the week is:
- Revenue per night * Number of nights open in a week = $15 * 2 = $30

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $30."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we calculate the profit per watermelon and add it to the cost per watermelon.

\[
\text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is 18 years old.

Now, let's find out how old John is. Since James is 18 and John was 19 when James was born, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Ana spends 3 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour. Since Jane spends 4 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
\[ 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $400 (since 100% - 80% = 20%):
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the discounted price of the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 470 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. Let's confirm this by checking the total number of legs:
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- The total number of legs is \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given information.

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
