"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after using some for breakfast and baking.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for baking, totaling 7 eggs used.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

To find the total amount she makes, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value, we can use the formula: New value = Original value + (Original value * Percentage increase)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the common ratio between the costs of the glasses. The ratio between the second and the first glass is 0.6, and the ratio between the third and the second glass is also 0.6. This means the cost of each glass decreases by a factor of 0.6.

The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the second glass is $3. The cost of the third glass is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.0023259456896.

However, we can use a formula to find the sum of the costs of the glasses. The sum of a geometric series is given by S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $5, r = 0.6, and n = 16. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)
S = $5 * (1 - 0.000061035) / 0.4
S = $5 * 0.999938965 / 0.4
S = $5 * 2.4998472415
S = $12.4986372075

However, this is the sum of the costs of the glasses, excluding the first glass. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the first glass:

Total cost = $5 + $12.4986372075
Total cost = $17.4986372075

Rounding to two decimal places, the total cost is $17.50.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city and then add them together.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into manageable parts.

First, let's find the time it takes to download 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we need to find 40% of 200 GB:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, we need to add the time it takes to download the entire 200 GB again. We can find this by adding the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file (40 minutes) to the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file (60 minutes), and then add the time it takes to install the updates (20 minutes):
Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

Let's denote the distance from John's home as x miles.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's consider the return trip. Since John is trying to get home in 4 hours, we need to find the distance he traveled in the return trip. We know he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic and then drove for 2.5 hours (half an hour at 30 mph and 2 hours at 80 mph).

Let's denote the distance from John's current location to home as x miles. The distance he needs to cover in the return trip is x miles.

The time taken to cover the distance in the return trip is 4 hours. We can set up an equation using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = (x - 15 - 160) / 80 (for the 2 hours at 80 mph) + 0.5 (for the half hour at 30 mph) + 2 (for the 2 hours in standstill traffic)
4 = (x - 175) / 80 + 2.5

Simplifying the equation:
4 = (x - 175) / 80 + 2.5
4 - 2.5 = (x - 175) / 80
1.5 = (x - 175) / 80
1.5 * 80 = x - 175
120 = x - 175
x = 120 + 175
x = 295

However, this is the distance from John's current location to home. We need to find the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours. Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

The distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is 0 miles.

The final answer is: 0"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into two categories: regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

To find her total earnings, we add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 * $80 = $160.

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year. The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.

The net revenue each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

The total cost of the tree is equal to the total revenue generated minus the total maintenance cost over 'n' years. We can set up the equation:

90 = 7.5n - 3n

Combine like terms:

90 = 4.5n

Now, divide both sides by 4.5:

n = 90 / 4.5
n = 20

However, this is the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself, but we want to know when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we need to consider the first year as the year it starts earning money.

Therefore, it will take 20 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as ""x"".

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. After this sale, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us the solution: x = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the optimal purchase choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option.

The increase in value for the jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The increase in value for the electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Comparing the two options, the jewelry will increase in value by $125, while the electronic gadgets will increase in value by $96. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Given that two trains travel in a two-dimensional plane, we can model their movement as a right-angled triangle. The first day's travel forms one leg of the triangle, while the second day's travel forms the other leg.

The first leg of the triangle is 80 miles (westward), and the second leg is 150 miles (northward). To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a = 80 miles, b = 150 miles, and c is the total distance covered by each train.

Plugging in the values, we get:

80^2 + 150^2 = c^2
6400 + 22500 = c^2
28900 = c^2
c = √28900
c = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Her hourly wage is $20, and she works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750 hours. Now, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. Her hourly wage is $30, and she works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750 hours. Now, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time frame.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. Therefore, in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. To find her average speed for the remaining distance, we need to determine the total time she has available to complete the hike.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can use the formula:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

However, she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to walk the remaining distance is:

Remaining time = Total time - Time spent walking the first 6 miles
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of the orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of the pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. 
The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.
The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The total number of DVDs sold is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price. To find 25% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.25. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, excluding the pizza boxes. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Now, we need to find the cost of the pizza boxes. Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days, she will need 60 servings of ice cream. Each carton contains 15 servings, so we divide 60 by 15 to find the total number of cartons:
60 / 15 = 4

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

We know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We know that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. We also know that the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, so H = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be expressed as an equation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94."
"Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant representing the ratio multiplier. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, 80 + 20 = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the daily time spent and then multiply it by 7.

First, we calculate the daily time spent: 
Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.
Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30 and S + G = 110.

We can substitute G = S + 30 into the second equation, which gives us S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we obtain 2S = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step using algebra.

Let R represent the number of jewels Raymond has, A represent the number of jewels Aaron has, and S represent the number of jewels Siobhan has.

Given:
1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = (1/2)R + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

Substituting the value of R into equation 2:
A = (1/2)(40) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, substitute the value of A into equation 3:
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts over 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of yogurts consumed. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set. 

15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then determine how many sets he sold with his own money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

This means John spent $190 of the money he made from selling the Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he sold with his own money, we need to find out how much money he spent from his own pocket. Since he has $5 left, he must have spent $5 of his own money.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35 (190 - 5 = 185 dollars). 
185 / 15 = 12.33 (round down to 12 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 12 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales and 1 set with his own money.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 12 = 1 Lego set left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

To convert this to a more conventional unit, we can express the speed in miles per hour (mph) as a decimal or a fraction. However, since the question does not specify the unit, we will leave it as is.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Dana's walking speed as W, her running speed as R, and her skipping speed as S. We are given that S = 3 miles per hour and R = 2S = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We are also given that R = 4W, so we can find W by dividing R by 4: W = R / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time she spends walking and running. We are given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is W * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is R * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to establish the age of each iPhone based on the given information.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we multiply Suzy's age by 2 to find Ben's age: 1 * 2 = 2 years.

Now, we know Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's age by 4: 2 * 4 = 8 years.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3.

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames.

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we need to calculate the total number of pieces initially available and then subtract the number of pieces remaining.

First, we find the total number of pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

"To determine the remaining daily calorie allowance, we subtract the calories already consumed from the daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we need to find out how many grams can be consumed from a 300g bag that has 5 servings. To do this, we multiply the number of servings by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes and sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's find the total cost. One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax.

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we can multiply the number of articles on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles on Monday. This is equivalent to 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used at work, and the Post-it notes remaining. This can be expressed as:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 231.

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's denote the number of blue ties as B and the cost of each blue tie as C. We are given that the number of blue ties is 200 / C = 5, which implies C = 40.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2B = 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5C = 1.5 * 40 = 60.

The total cost of blue ties is BC = 5 * 40 = 200.

The total cost of red ties is 1.5BC = 1.5 * 40 * 10 = 600.

The total amount spent on ties is BC + 1.5BC = 2.5BC = 2.5 * 40 * 5 = 500 + 300 = 800.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens, as eggs are sold by the dozen.

First, we find the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Now, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Finally, we calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's find the time it took to travel from 1 to 4 PM. The distance is 3 hours, and Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = rate * time, we can rearrange it to find time: time = distance / rate. So, the time it took to travel 3 hours at 10 miles per hour is 3 hours / 10 miles per hour = 0.3 hours. However, since the question asks for the time in terms of hours and minutes, we convert 0.3 hours to 18 minutes. However, since the question asks for the time in terms of hours, we will keep it as 0.3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 0.3 hours + 5 hours = 5.3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removed and then determine how many toys he needs to remove to reach the desired weight reduction of 15 pounds.

First, let's find the total weight of the comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds are left to remove. Since Uriah wants to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to reach the desired weight reduction of 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the revenue from car tires only since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

This is a classic example of a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1/2. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: an = a1 * r^(n-1), where a1 is the first term and r is the common ratio.

In this case, a1 = 16 and r = 1/2. We can find the square footage of each level by plugging in the values of n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 into the formula:

Level 1: a1 = 16
Level 2: a2 = 16 * (1/2)^(2-1) = 16 * (1/2)^1 = 8
Level 3: a3 = 16 * (1/2)^(3-1) = 16 * (1/2)^2 = 4
Level 4: a4 = 16 * (1/2)^(4-1) = 16 * (1/2)^3 = 2

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food used in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of food consumed in two phases: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed in this period is 180 cups.

For the remaining days of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food consumed in this period is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food consumed in the first year is the sum of the food consumed in the two periods: 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the total number of bags used by dividing the total amount of food consumed by the capacity of one bag: 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D, the amount Sarah does as S, and the amount Raymond does as R.

Given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express this as S = 4D.

We are also given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so S = 400. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get 400 = 4D.

To find the amount of laundry David does, we can solve for D by dividing both sides of the equation by 4: D = 400 / 4 = 100.

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = S / 2. Substituting S = 400 into this equation, we get R = 400 / 2 = 200.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we can subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: R - D = 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the better price for buying 18 flowers, let's compare the cost per flower of each package.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, we find 30% of $100 by multiplying 0.3 by $100, which equals $30. 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find the amount of water left, we first need to determine how much water the girls received. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they received a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we know that a boy received 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W.

We are given two equations: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after a 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

First, we'll find the salary after 5 years. The initial salary is $600, and the increase is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we'll calculate the salary for the next 3 years. The increase is 10% of the current salary, which is 0.1 * $900 = $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. For the 7th year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is 0.1 * $990 = $99. The salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089. For the 8th year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is 0.1 * $1089 = $109.1. The salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1. For the 9th year, the increase is 10% of $1198.1, which is 0.1 * $1198.1 = $119.81. The salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find the total number of gift bags needed, we first need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Now, we need to calculate the number of gift bags needed per guest. Christina needs 3/4 of a gift bag per guest, which is equivalent to 0.75. We multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the amount eaten by adults. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, let's find the amount eaten by children. Since children eat half as much as adults, and each adult eats 10 pounds, each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. With 5 children, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as C. We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so C = 4.

We are also given that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Therefore, the number of pets Marcia has can be expressed as C + 2. Substituting the value of C, we get Marcia's pets as 4 + 2 = 6.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, the number of pets Jan has can be expressed as 3 * (C + 2). Substituting the value of C, we get Jan's pets as 3 * (4 + 2) = 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: C + (C + 2) + 3 * (C + 2) = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows: Amy = A, Jackson = J, Corey = C, and James = M.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5
2. A = C - 2
3. M = C - 1
4. M = 10

We can start by substituting the value of M from equation 4 into equation 3 to find the value of C:

C = M + 1
C = 10 + 1
C = 11

Now that we have the value of C, we can substitute it into equation 2 to find the value of A:

A = C - 2
A = 11 - 2
A = 9

Next, we can substitute the value of A into equation 1 to find the value of J:

J = A - 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, the age of Jackson is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to determine his original time. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, we need to find 10% of 40, which represents the improvement in Gerald's speed. To calculate this, we multiply 40 by 0.1 (since 10% is equivalent to 0.1 as a decimal). 
0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 4 seconds, so we subtract this from his original time to find his new time. 
40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R. We are given the following information:

We can substitute the value of D into the second equation to find the value of C:
C = 2(60)
C = 120

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into the first equation to find the value of R:
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total = D + C + R
Total = 60 + 120 + 168
Total = 348

"To find the total number of tomatoes used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, let's analyze the situation. We know that a total of 25 cars drove through the traffic jam, and 20 of them did so in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25. 

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20. We can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 20 by 4. 20 / 4 = 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to understand the rate at which it covers the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.

Given that the city is 42 miles across, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. However, we need to first find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles.

To do this, we can divide 42 by 3.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total time spent watching 1-hour episodes. Frankie watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes on Monday and Tuesday, and 2 hours on Friday. So, the total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

Next, we need to find the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday and Thursday. We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Since he spent 4 hours watching 1-hour episodes, the remaining time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 4 = 3 hours.

Now, let's consider the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Thursday. Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode on Thursday, which is a total of 1.5 hours. Since we already know that he spent 3 hours watching 30-minute episodes, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he bakes 2x cookies. However, he accidentally bakes 15 more cookies than he intended, so the actual number of cookies he bakes is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, which means the boat took on 2 liters of water for those 20 feet. To find the rate, we can divide the distance by the time: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can find the rate of water intake in liters per second. We know that 20 feet is 2 sets of 10 feet, so the boat takes on 2 * 2 = 4 liters for 20 feet. To find the rate, we can divide the water intake by the time: 4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters/second.

Now, let's find the total time it took to reach the shore: 64 seconds. We can multiply the rate of water intake by the total time to find the total water intake: 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

1. B + 6D = 300 (since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, which is 300 times more than Brittany's phone)
2. B = 50D (since the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for D:

300 = 50D + 6D
300 = 56D
D = 300 / 56
D = 5.357142857 (approximately)

However, since the number of birds must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a bird.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. 

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Now, we are given that the total amount of the mixture is 120. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar, which is 7/20.

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture: (7/20) * 120 = 42.

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid for the shoes, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children.

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

The total amount John paid for the shoes is $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, so the number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Next, we need to find the increase in their salaries. Both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40% of their old salaries. For Adrien, the increase is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, his new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, for Lylah, the increase is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, her new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to calculate the weekly usage and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, his weekly usage is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can find the total monthly usage by multiplying the weekly usage by 4: 60 * 4 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Total number of fruits Morisette brought: 5 + 8 = 13
Total number of fruits Kael brought: 10 + 4 = 14

Total number of fruits they have in total: 13 + 14 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to consider the information given. Jennie stamps one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which is 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters. 

After stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40. However, we are given that the number of letters in the already-stamped pile is now 30. This implies that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the already-stamped pile.

To find the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile, we subtract the 20 letters Jennie added from the current number of letters in the pile: 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 'x' spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she had a total of x + 5 spoons. After using 3 spoons, she had (x + 5) - 3 spoons left. We are told that this number is equal to 12.

We can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has.

Lily made 50 friends. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can find Amy's number of friends by adding 20 to Lily's number of friends: 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we can use the given information to set up an equation.

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as p. We know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3p. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 3p - 5.

Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total amount of money he will spend can be represented by the equation:

4(3p) + 20p + 10(3p - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12p + 20p + 30p - 50
Combine like terms:
62p - 50

We are given that each pepper costs $15, so we can substitute p = 15 into the equation:

62(15) - 50
= 930 - 50
= 880

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit made by the hospital, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We know that 500 patients are seen each day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue generated from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour to each patient, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to calculate the number of elves that quit and subtract it from the initial number of elves.

First, a third of the elves quit. To find a third of 60, we divide 60 by 3, which equals 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial number of elves: 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Next, 10 more elves quit. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

We are also given that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be expressed as b = 3B - 5.

Substituting the value of B into the equation, we get b = 3(15) - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get b = 45 - 5.

Further simplifying, we get b = 40.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip of $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. However, Mark only had 8 hours, so he completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. However, Mark only had 6 hours, so he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in the second test.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175

Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70 = 105

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost of food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Next, we'll find the total cost of non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Let's start by calculating the total number of clients: 3 current clients + 5 potential clients = 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since the total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, we need to convert hectares to a more manageable unit. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can start with this information. 

There are 10 hectares of pineapples, so the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 30 of these bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (from step 3) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

"Let's analyze the given information:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

We can represent the number of friends Dorothy has as ""x"". Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express Charlie's friends as 3x. Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express James' friends as 4x. Substituting the value of x, we get:
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

"To determine the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school, we need to convert their distances to feet and calculate their respective times.

Steve lives 3 miles away from the school. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9.

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply that by the cost per cookie.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6
Cost per cookie: $0.10

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of french fries initially as x.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are (x - 30). The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Let's break it down by day. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we can convert this to inches by multiplying by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches. Then, 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must calculate the monthly consumption of each type of ape and then multiply it by 2 to account for the 2-month period.

Monkeys require 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons require 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount spent by Raphael, we need to calculate the cost of the items he purchased.

The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The total amount spent by Raphael is $34."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we start with the initial count of 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding, increasing the count to 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, so we need to subtract them from the total count. The correct calculation is 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to understand the concept of exponential growth. The price increases by 20% every two months, which can be represented as a geometric progression.

The initial price is $20, and the common ratio (r) is 1.20 (100% + 20% increase). We need to find the price after 18 periods of growth (36 months / 2 months per period).

Using the formula for compound growth:

A = P * (1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final amount
P = initial amount ($20)
r = common ratio (1.20)
n = number of periods (18)

A = $20 * (1.20)^18
A ≈ $20 * 12.688
A ≈ $258.16

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the difference in financial outcome between doing taxes herself and hiring an accountant, we need to consider the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

The difference in financial outcome is calculated as follows:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can express this relationship as an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is the number of gallons multiplied by the price per gallon, which is $10. The total cost is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar, which is $5 per gallon.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we are given that the profit is $25. We can set up the equation as follows:

10g - 5g = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5g = 25

Now, we can solve for 'g' by dividing both sides by 5:

g = 25 / 5
g = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is:

Total cost of lemons = 3g
Total cost of lemons = 3 * 5
Total cost of lemons = 15

2. M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5 (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age)
3. J = 30 (Jan is 30 years old)

Substituting J = 30 into equation 2, we get:
M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

However, I noticed that the total time for the less well-rounded team was miscalculated. Let's recalculate it: 60 + 57 = 117, 117 + 54 = 171, 171 + 51 = 222.

"To determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we consider the favorable outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled independently, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of the latter from the former: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to determine the number of apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing her mother's total by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3r.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90. So, we can set up the equation 6 * 3r = 90.

Simplifying the equation, we get 18r = 90.

To solve for 'r', we divide both sides of the equation by 18, which gives us r = 90 / 18.

Simplifying the fraction, we get r = 5.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

We can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial amount), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of months.

However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we can also use the formula: A = P(1 + r)^n = P(1 + r)^3.

Plugging in the values, we get: A = $100(1 + 0.02)^3.

First, we calculate the value inside the parentheses: 1 + 0.02 = 1.02.

Then, we raise 1.02 to the power of 3: (1.02)^3 ≈ 1.061208.

Now, we multiply the initial amount by this value: $100 * 1.061208 ≈ $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects and then multiply it by the peaches collected per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and John collects for 3 hours. 
So, the total minutes he collects is 60 * 3 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the total pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they require per week. 

Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects per duck per week: 10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck = 35 pounds/week.

Now, to find the pounds of insects needed per day, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by the number of days in a week, which is 7: 35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, then subtract the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount of money she has.

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors and one crayon costs $2, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons = 10

Total cost of crayons = Total number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the pounds of carrots not used, we need to calculate the total pounds distributed and subtract that from the initial amount.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

The final answer is: 120"

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

Next, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Then, in the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100, and twice that is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we have x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so the amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 2 * 5x = 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which has 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. Therefore, the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, let's consider the slices used for omelets. Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

Now, let's consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for each meal together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for each period and add them together.

25 kilometers * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers

Then, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks:
60 kilometers * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods:
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, we find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

"Let's denote the cost of each cup as 'c'. We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen plates cost $6000 each, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We can express the cost of twenty dozen cups as 20 * 12 * c = 240c. According to the problem, this is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, so we can write the equation:

240c = 36000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240c = 34800

To find the cost of each cup, we divide both sides of the equation by 240:

c = 34800 / 240

c = 145

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, the number of red chickens is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to calculate the total number of customers on the first two days and then subtract that from the total by the third day.

The number of customers on the first day is 100. The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150.

Now, let's find the total number of customers on the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total by the third day: 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10%.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:
$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay including the additional 10%:
The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and the additional 10% is $2000 * 0.10 = $200. Therefore, the total amount to be paid is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance:
Total amount to be paid: $2200
Amount paid in 12 months: $1980
Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"Let's denote Harriet's current age as H, Zack's current age as Z, and Adrian's current age as A. We are given that H = 21, A = 3H, and Z = 2H.

Substituting the given values, we get A = 3(21) = 63 and Z = 2(21) = 42.

In three years, their ages will be H + 3, Z + 3, and A + 3. 

We can express this as (H + 3), (2H + 3), and (3H + 3). Substituting the value of H, we get (21 + 3), (2(21) + 3), and (3(21) + 3).

Simplifying, we get 24, 45, and 66.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3.

Combining the terms, we get 135 / 3.

Simplifying, we get 45.

"To find the points scored by Jojo, we first need to determine the points scored by the other three students. 

Let's start with Naomi's points, which are given as 68. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial water type cards = 40
Initial grass type cards = 20
Initial total cards = 40 + 20 + 30 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards: 
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34

3. J = 20 (Jessa is 20 years old)

We can substitute the value of J into equation (2) to find J':
J' = 20 + 5
J' = 25

Now, we can substitute the value of J' into equation (1) to find M:
M = J' - 2
M = 25 - 2
M = 23

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add J, J', and M:

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we multiply 1000 by 0.3:
0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find the number of students who remained in the hall. This is 1000 minus the students who went out through exit A:
1000 - 300 = 700 students remained.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 700 by 3/5:
(3/5) * 700 = (3 * 700) / 5 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find the number of students who remained after exit B. This is 700 minus the students who went out through exit B:
700 - 420 = 280 students remained.

Since the rest of the students went out through exit C, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's find the total minutes used for his daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Next, we add the extra minutes: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by distributing the 2 on the right-hand side:

28 = 4x

Next, we can divide both sides by 4 to isolate x:

7 = x

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the daily cost, then multiply it by the number of days per week, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist works 4 days a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find the total cost of the party supplies, we need to add up the individual expenses.

The cost of the cake is $12, the birthday presents cost $43, the decorations cost $15, the invitations cost $4, and the goodie bags cost $22.

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. 
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50.
Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate in total. On Monday, she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's add up the total cookies eaten by Sue: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Next, let's find out how many cookies her sister ate in total: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister. Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find the difference in calories consumed, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60. 

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

"To find the number of apps Travis has now, we need to consider the changes in his app collection. Initially, he had 61 apps. He then deleted 9 apps, which leaves him with 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Following this, he downloaded 18 more apps, bringing the total to 52 + 18 = 70 apps.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed each night and then sum them up.

Let's start with the cougars. Rick killed 15 cougars the first night. The next night, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, let's find the number of wolves he killed the second night. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

To find the total number of wolves he killed, we add the wolves from both nights: 10 (first night) + 36 (second night) = 46.

Now, let's find the total number of cougars he killed: 15 (first night) + 12 (second night) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the wolves and cougars: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To find out how many times Anne went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies: 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.

Next, we'll calculate the value of the nickels: 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.

Then, we'll calculate the value of the dimes: 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.

Finally, we'll calculate the value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40.

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to determine the total number of 10-foot sections. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. To find the weight of the remaining wood, we need to calculate 70% of 8000. 

To find 70% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.7: 8000 * 0.7 = 5600.

The final weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'J'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has can be expressed as J + 8. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation J + 8 = 52.

Solving for J, we get J = 52 - 8 = 44. This means Jamal has 44 apples.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is J + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: (J + 8) + J + 24 + 48 = 44 + 8 + 24 + 48 = 124.

However, we know that Andrea has 52 apples, not 44 + 8. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the number of apples Andrea has as A. We are given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has A - 8 apples.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is (A - 8) + 4 = A - 4.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is (1/2) * (A - 4).

We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so A = 52.

Substituting A = 52 into the expression for the number of bananas Andrea has, we get (1/2) * (52 - 4) = 24.

We can now find the number of bananas Jamal has: A - 4 = 52 - 4 = 48.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: A + (A - 8) + (1/2) * (A - 4) + (A - 4) = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. She is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. To do this, we divide 66 by 12 to find the number of dozens: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Now, we need to convert 5.5 dozens into cups of flour. Since 5.5 is equivalent to 5 and a half, we can break it down into two parts: 5 dozens and 6 cookies. We need 1 cup of flour for 6 cookies, as 6 is half of a dozen.

For the 5 dozen cookies, we need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

To find the total amount of flour needed, we add the flour required for the 5 dozen cookies and the 6 cookies: 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300.

First, we divide 9,300 by 3 to find one third of 9,300: 9,300 / 3 = 3,100.

Then, we multiply this result by 2 to find two thirds of 9,300: 3,100 * 2 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount: 6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

The initial number of marbles is found by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.

Next, we add the marbles she received from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in Harry's yard, we first need to determine the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, we calculate the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard. This is calculated by subtracting the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to add up their individual amounts.

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 = $225, and $225 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee as a percentage of the selling price.

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 = 612
612 + 150 = 762

"To find the total number of windows, we first need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 315.

"To find the total amount of money spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

Next, we'll find the cost of the celery seeds: 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, we add the two costs together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The total amount of money spent on seeds is $3200."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's start with the solo song, which has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we need to find one-third of 108. To do this, we divide 108 by 3, which gives us 36 lines from the first scene that Sean has to memorize.

Moving on to the second scene, it has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, we need to find four-fifths of 60. To do this, we multiply 60 by 4 and then divide by 5, which gives us (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene that Sean has to memorize.

Now, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We are given that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the 20 in the expression (M + m) + 20 is not the same as the 20 in the equation M + m = 20. The 20 in the expression (M + m) + 20 is actually the 20 that we are adding to M + m, not the value of M + m itself.

So, the correct expression is (M + m) + 20, which is equal to 20 + 20 = 40. But we are adding 20 to the sum of their ages, not the sum of their ages itself. Therefore, we need to add 20 to 20, which is 40.

However, we are adding 20 to the sum of their ages, not the sum of their ages itself. Therefore, we need to add 20 to 20, which is 40. But we are adding 20 to the sum of their ages, not the sum of their ages itself. Therefore, we need to add 20 to 20, which is 40. However, we are adding 20 to the sum of their ages, not the sum of their ages itself. Therefore, we need to add 20 to 20, which is 40.

The correct answer is actually 40 + 20 = 60.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. Since Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, we multiply 20 by $0.25 to get the total cost of the popsicles: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Next, we find the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so we multiply 4 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the ice cream bars: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To determine the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we first calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can start by determining the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 of them, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones.

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of beads. Let's denote the number of beads as 'b'. The total length of the necklace is the sum of the length taken up by the gemstones and the length of the spaces. We can write this as:

8 + (7/4)b = 25

To solve for 'b', we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

32 + 7b = 100

Next, we can subtract 32 from both sides of the equation:

7b = 68

Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for 'b':

b = 68 / 7
b = 9.71 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 9.71 is closer to 10 than 9, but we can't use 10 beads because that would make the total length of the necklace greater than 25 inches. Therefore, we need to recalculate the number of beads.

Let's recalculate the number of beads using the correct approach:

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches. The remaining length is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

The length of each bead is 1/4 inch, so the number of beads is 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

However, this is the total number of spaces between the gemstones, not the number of beads. Since there are 7 spaces between the gemstones, we can divide the total number of spaces by 7 to find the number of beads per space:

68 / 7 = 9.71 (rounded to two decimal places)

However, we can see that 9.71 is closer to 10 than 9, but we can't use 10 beads because that would make the total length of the necklace greater than 25 inches. Therefore, we need to recalculate the number of beads.

"To find the total number of stories written, we first need to calculate the number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of these three values.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is the product of the number of flagstones and the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Weight capacity per truck
= 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
= 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"Let's denote the speed of the car in the slow lane as 's' miles/hour. We are given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, which is twice the speed of the car in the slow lane. Therefore, s = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

We are also given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as x. We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

The combined total of Ali and Izzy's medals is 22 + 17 = 39. According to the problem, this is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

10x = 39

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

"To find the total number of chocolate bars available, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

The remaining chocolate bars for the children are 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to convert the time to minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Next, we divide the total minutes by 10 to find the number of intervals.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Let's denote Mike's points as M, Jim's points as J, and Tony's points as T. We know that M = 21, J = M - 3, and T = 2M.

We can substitute the values of M and J in terms of M into the equation for T: T = 2M = 2(21) = 42.

Now, let's find the points of each player after the fourth round. Every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

Target = 120 crates

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the total amount bid. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, there are a total of 4 people who bid once, and then Carmen bids once more, resulting in a total of 5 bids.

The total amount bid is the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term a = 200, the common difference d = 50, and the number of terms n = 5.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (5/2) * (2*200 + (5-1)*50)
S = 2.5 * (400 + 4*50)
S = 2.5 * (400 + 200)
S = 2.5 * 600
S = 1500

The final answer is: $1500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

To find the total miles driven per year, we need to multiply the daily miles by the number of days driven per year. There are 5 days/week and 50 weeks/year, so the total days driven per year is 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 250 days/year. Now, we can find the total miles driven per year: 60 miles/day * 250 days/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we need to calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

Now, let's find the total bonus. John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we need to multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we can find the total cost per year by adding the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 

To find the combined total, we add these two values together: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined total by 2: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's analyze the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

Considering the arrangement of pages in a 32-page tabloid, we can observe a pattern:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. 

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent at the town fair.

First, we find the amount she spent on food and snacks, which is half of the initial $50. This is calculated as $50 / 2 = $25.

Next, we add the additional $10 she spent on rides to the amount spent on food and snacks: $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. We are given that x = 45.

We also know that the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold in the current year, so the number of books sold in the first year is 2x = 2 * 45 = 90.

The total number of books sold in the first two years is the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year, which is 90 + 45 = 135.

Since there are 50 unsold books, the total number of books is 250. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is 250 - 50 - 135 = 65.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book, which is $20.

Total money earned in the second year = 65 * 20 = $1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we need to calculate his total hours worked and his total earnings from both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Since April has 4 weeks, we can calculate Watson's total earnings for the month by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, as he beat 80% of the people.

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is calculated as 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, not 2 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we need to multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4.

"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find the number of extra arms: 15 / 3 = 5.

Next, let's find the number of extra legs. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we can divide the total number of days (15) by 5 to find the number of extra legs: 15 / 5 = 3.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.

Now, let's find the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we add up the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Next, we subtract the total cost from Theo's initial budget to find out how much he has left: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from the remaining budget to find out how much he has left to spend on gifts: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

However, we need to consider that the question asks for the amount he has to spend on gifts, not the amount he has left over. Since he has $2050 left over, and he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to first determine the total number of eggs consumed in a day. 

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so their total is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The remaining family members are 5 - 3 = 2, and they eat 2 eggs each day, so their total is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. We are given the following information:

1. T = J + 5 (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)
2. J = Q - 3 (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)
3. Q = 30 (Quinn is 30 years old)

We can substitute the value of Q into the second equation to find Jane's age:
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, we can substitute the value of J into the first equation to find Trent's age:
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's denote the current age of Noah as N and the current population of Chile as P.

We are given that six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we get:

N = 26

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so we can write the equation:

P - 60000 = 3000(N - 6)

Substituting N = 26 into the equation, we get:

P - 60000 = 3000(20)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P - 60000 = 60000

Adding 60000 to both sides, we get:

P = 120000

The final answer is: 120000"
"To find the number of players on the defense, we can denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Then, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5: (20 * 2) / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, and its volume can be found by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Given dimensions:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to calculate the total cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

"Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N. We are given that B = 30.

We are also given that the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, so we can express this as G = 3B. Substituting the value of B, we get G = 3(30) = 90.

Furthermore, we are given that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys, so we can express this as N = (1/10)B. Substituting the value of B, we get N = (1/10)(30) = 3.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: Total = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3.

Simplifying the expression, we get Total = 123.

The final answer is: $\boxed{123}$"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can establish a proportion to find the number of electric poles required. 

Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires is 3x. We are told that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to start by finding the total number of people who left the party. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate this as 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 10 people left, and we are given that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Since 10 people left in total, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost by dividing the book's cost by 2.

The magazine's cost is $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. We are told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can find the pen's cost by subtracting $1 from the magazine's cost.

The pen's cost is $2 - $1 = $1.

"To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream separately, then add them together.

First, let's consider the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. Since the temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the cream. The coffee is weakened by 15 milliliters when 15 milliliters of cream are added.

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream, which is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as 'x'. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. We are given that 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them.

The total number of new records is 7, and since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2 * 7 = 14.

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can set up the equation 5x = 14, where x is the number of old records each person brought in.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 14 / 5
x = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

Total number of old records = 5x
Total number of old records = 5 * 2.8
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of junior programmers. We are given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. If the total number of employees is 100, then the number of junior programmers is:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
= 2 * 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. We are given that junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers is:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, let's find the salary of senior programmers. We are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the salary of senior programmers is:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, let's denote this number as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine the total charge required. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops she has after receiving additional lollipops from her mother and then subtract the number she gives away.

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find the amount the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip and apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On the current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the total income, subtract the property tax, and then subtract the income tax for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. Since there's no property tax mentioned, we'll proceed with the income tax calculation. The income tax is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Subtracting the income tax from the total income, we get $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 as the net income.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Subtracting the income tax from the net income before tax, we get $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400 as the net income.

Comparing the net incomes, Job B offers a higher net pay. To find the difference, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. This can be represented by the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We are given that H = 2C and H + C = 60.

We can substitute H in the second equation with 2C, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from making tractors to silos.

The daily earnings from making tractors is 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day.

The daily earnings from making silos is 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month first. 

The cost of food per month is calculated by multiplying the cost of food per week by the number of weeks in a month: 
Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = $25 * 4 = $100

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Treats cost per month = $20
Medicine cost per month = $100
Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To calculate the total time for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to determine the time for each activity and add them up.

Monday's yoga class lasts 1 hour. 
Tuesday's cooking class is three times as long as Monday's yoga, so it lasts 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is half an hour, or 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it lasts 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands last 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. She also needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to determine the amount of money she had after spending and giving her brother money, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Let's start with the initial amount: $36. Andrea spent $11 on a sweater, so we subtract that from the initial amount: $36 - $11 = $25. Then, she gave her brother $4, so we subtract that from the remaining amount: $25 - $4 = $21.

Now, we need to find the amount Andrea saved. To do this, we subtract the amount she had after spending and giving her brother money from the initial amount: $36 - $21 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities and then find 40% of that total.

First, let's find the time spent on boating and swimming. John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, we'll find the time spent watching shows. Since there were 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we can add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

However, we know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's use this information to find the total time. We can set up an equation: 30% of total time = 6 hours. Converting the percentage to a decimal, we get 0.30 * total time = 6. Solving for the total time, we get total time = 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. Converting the percentage to a decimal, we get 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from her first job, where she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from her second job, where she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, we'll add her earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we'll subtract her total earnings from her savings to find out how much more she needs:
$80 - $275 = -$195

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Annabelle still needs to save more to reach her goal. To find out how much more she needs, we'll subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first determine the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he received plus the extra $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17
Dean initially received $28 and got an extra $10, so he now has $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's find out how much she spends on lollipops each day. Since each lollipop costs $0.25, 4 lollipops will cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how much money Billy had left after buying the candy. He started with $10 and spent an unknown amount on candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

The amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Let's denote the distance from the first city to the second city as x = 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city as y = 100 miles. The combined distance is x + y = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is then 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. The total distance in one trip is the sum of the distances from the first city to the second city, from the second city to the third city, and from the third city to the first city: x + y + (175 - 50) = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 3 times the total distance in one trip: 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey and then add them together.

First, let's find the time taken to drive to John's friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's find the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we add the time taken for each leg of the journey to find the total time taken for the trip.

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to first determine the total number of students present and then subtract the number of girls from it.

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of absent girls = 5
Number of absent boys = 4

Total number of students absent = 5 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 9
Number of students present = Total number of fourth-graders - Total number of students absent
= 96 - 9
= 87

Number of girls present = Total number of girls - Number of absent girls
= 43 - 5
= 38

Number of boys present = Number of students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38
= 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of kids in the park is the sum of the number of boys and girls: 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18.

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. This can be expressed as S = 4M - 5. Substituting M = 3 into this equation, we get S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

Next, we are given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. This can be expressed as V = 3S. Substituting S = 7 into this equation, we get V = 3(7) = 21.

We are also given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons. This can be expressed as M + S + V + O = 50, where O is the number of people kicked out for other reasons.

Substituting M = 3, S = 7, and V = 21 into this equation, we get 3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50. Simplifying this equation, we get 31 + O = 50. Subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation, we get O = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's denote Erin's points before as 'x'. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can express Erin's current points as 3 * 8 + 8 = 24. However, we are given that Erin has 14 points now. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 14 = 24. 

To solve for x, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 14. 

x = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4. Since there are 44 frames, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. Therefore, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Friday is 14 * 2 = 28.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 * 2 = 56.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 56 / 2 = 28.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. The total shoes sold on Sunday is 28 - 12 = 16.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
100 * 2 = 200

However, this is the total number of shoes sold, but we need to consider the returns. The total number of shoes sold is 100, and 12 shoes were returned. So, the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale is 100 - 12 = 88.

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

The profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had is 32 hectares.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"When dealing with ratios, we can use the concept of proportions to solve problems involving parts and totals. In this case, we have a ratio of 5:6 representing the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, respectively. The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can set up a proportion using the ratio and the total number of popsicles. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the sum of the number of popsicles they have is 165, so we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Now, solve for x by dividing both sides by 11: x = 165 / 11 = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = 5x = 5 * 15 = 75
Sam's popsicles = 6x = 6 * 15 = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Since there are 90 spiders, we can find the number of millipedes by multiplying 90 by 1/3. To do this, we can multiply 90 by 1 and then divide by 3.

90 * 1 = 90
90 / 3 = 30

So, there are 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We already know there are 30 millipedes, so we can multiply 30 by 2 and then subtract 12.

30 * 2 = 60
60 - 12 = 48

So, there are 48 stink bugs.

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour, the total amount needed is 4 times the amount in the normal recipe, which is 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total amount of flour required by the amount in each bag: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags.

For milk, the total amount needed is 4 times the amount in the normal recipe, which is 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk required by the amount in each bottle: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles.

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy used per day. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and it is used for 8 hours a day, the original energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh).

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000, since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh. Therefore, 7200 Wh is equal to 7.2 kWh.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we calculate the total pounds of meat and cheese needed. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of each, so we multiply the number of sandwiches by 2.

5 sandwiches * 2 pounds per sandwich = 10 pounds

The cost of the meat is 10 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $70.00
The cost of the cheese is 10 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $30.00

The total cost is $70.00 + $30.00 = $100.00

The final answer is: $100.00"
"Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C. We are given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, so the initial number of corns is 2C.

We know that the initial number of cannolis is 40, so we can set up the equation C = 40.

The initial number of corns is 2C, which is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's find the total time it takes to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book as follows:

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to read the book by dividing the total number of words by Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute:

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Next, we need to add the time it takes to get to the airport, which is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time Toby will be at the airport is:

Total time = Time to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the total time from the required time:

Time early = Required time - Total time = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To find the total cost of the items Sally bought, we need to calculate the cost of the taffy, the seashells, and the magnets separately.

The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we multiply this rate by the number of nights:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Next, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies her recipe makes per dozen to find the required number of dozens:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, we are interested in the subset of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. The problem states that 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. But we are given that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. This means that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous is 0.05 * 0.01 * 50000 = 2.5.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a candle, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (60) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (45). Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 105 (sister's total) = 500

Combine like terms:
45 + x + 105 = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:
x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the value of C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the value of D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the trip into its components and calculate the distance for each part.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance for these 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30 (since 30% is equivalent to 30/100 or 0.30):
800 km * 0.30 = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to start with Peter's locker size, which is given as 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write the equation: J = T - 6.

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting J from the first equation into the second equation, we get: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. We know that he made $50 from selling the cards, and each card is sold for $1.5. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to eliminate the fraction:

x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to isolate x:

x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests.

For the other half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared enough for them to have one hotdog each. So, 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Set of pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we'll calculate the discount:
Discount = 20% of $165.00
To find 20% of $165.00, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20 (since 20% is equivalent to 0.20).
Discount = $165.00 x 0.20
Discount = $33.00

Now, we'll calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Now, we convert 3 gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Next, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. To do this, we multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 3/4

Now, we convert 3/4 gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3/4 by 8.

"Let's denote the total amount of money George had initially as 'x'. Since he spent 99% of his money, we can express this as 0.99x = 5.

To find the initial amount of money George had, we can solve for x:
0.99x = 5
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.0505

Now, let's find the amount of money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, the cost of 3 bags is 3 * 0.40 = 1.20.

The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20. The amount of money George spent on candy bars is the difference between the total amount he spent and the amount he spent on chips:
Amount spent on candy bars = 5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:
Number of candy bars = 3.80 / 0.75
Number of candy bars = 5.0667

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to determine how much cake was eaten by Rory and her mom. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and each piece is equal, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. 

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we must convert the length to feet.

Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 3 yards is equivalent to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

With the length and width known, we can now calculate the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes caused by the oven and the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. However, we can also calculate the temperature increase in terms of hours, as the rate is given in degrees per hour. The temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. To find the rate in degrees per hour, we can divide 2 by 2 (since there are 2 sets of 10 minutes in an hour), which equals 1 degree per 10 minutes. Multiply this rate by 0.5 hours to find the temperature decrease due to the open window: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 degrees. However, we need to convert 0.5 degrees to degrees per 30 minutes. Since 0.5 degrees is the temperature decrease for 0.5 hours, we can multiply 0.5 by 2 to find the temperature decrease for 1 hour, which is 1 degree. Then, we can multiply 1 degree by 0.5 to find the temperature decrease for 0.5 hours, which is 0.5 degrees. However, we need to find the temperature decrease for 30 minutes, so we can multiply 0.5 degrees by 2 to find the temperature decrease for 30 minutes, which is 1 degree.

"To find James' total time, we first need to determine his individual times for each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we know that James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. Therefore, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time. James' swim and bike times are 36 + 85 = 121 minutes. So, his run time is 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to convert the given time for Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1.25 hours by 60 to get the equivalent time in minutes.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Finally, we need to find the length of Movie A, which is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To do this, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance it runs. Given that the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we must convert the time from minutes to hours.

Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance by multiplying the speed (32 miles per hour) by the time (0.5 hours): 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Now, we know that each tray holds 5 glasses. To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray: 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the current score difference between Joey and Marcy, we need to calculate their total points after their respective turns.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we calculate the difference between their total points to find out by how many points Joey is winning.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48
Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as P and the regular price of the soda as S. We are given that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. This can be represented as:

20 = P + S + 1

We are also given that the soda costs $3, so we can substitute S = 3 into the equation:

20 = P + 3 + 1
20 = P + 4

Now, we need to find the regular price of the popcorn. We are told that if we buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If we buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is the difference between the cost of the super ticket and the cost of the regular ticket plus the soda, minus the extra $1:

P = (20 - 12 - 3) - 1
P = 4

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to determine the original cost of filling one balloon and then calculate the new cost.

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total volume of soil needed, we must first calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are given as 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height.

The volume of a rectangular prism, such as a raised bed, is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. Therefore, the volume of one bed is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume of soil required by the volume of one bag: 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

35%"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the carrots weigh 48 pounds, the hay weighs 3150 pounds, and the oats weigh 1300 pounds. 

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles.

First, let's find the value of the aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Next, we calculate the value of the plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Now, we add the values of the cans and bottles to find the total weekly earnings: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total monthly earnings: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we first need to determine the number of plants Toni has. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the amount Ali has now, we need to calculate the amount Leila gave him and add it to the amount he already had.

Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $100 / 2 = $50.

Ali already had $21.

So, the total amount Ali has now is $21 + $50 = $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we can multiply $15 by 1/5.

1/5 * $15 = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

$15 + $3 = $18

The final answer is: $18"

"To find the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to determine the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student receives.

First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards. She has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

To find the number of students, we divide the total number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives: 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount. 

Becky's cost per apple: 45 cents
Number of apples: 20
Total cost: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents
Discount: $1 = 100 cents
Becky's total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents
Becky's total cost in dollars: 800 cents / 100 = $8

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount. 

Kelly's cost per apple: 50 cents
Number of apples: 20
Total cost: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents
Discount: 10% of 1000 cents = 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents
Kelly's total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents
Kelly's total cost in dollars: 900 cents / 100 = $9

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. 
Kelly's total cost - Becky's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has 2 sheets, 1 comforter, 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases, and 2 * 4 = 8 towels.

The total number of items per room is the sum of these: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.

Now, we multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. 

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the cost of the paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1 from it. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. 
The cost of the paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we first need to determine the total number of pencils initially in the class. 

There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. 
Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

1/5 of the total pencils were used after two months. 
Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 
Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet
2 remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students at the grade level, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total in 3 weeks, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk each week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"To find out how many books each child received, we need to determine the total number of books purchased and then divide that by the number of children.

The total amount spent on books is $300, and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since the books are divided equally among 4 children, we divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory. Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B.

We know that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3. The total number of kids in the class is 32.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as:
|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

The number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is the total number of kids minus the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts:
32 - 12 = 20

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, we find the total number of employees by multiplying the number of groups by the number of employees in each group: 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides in each group: 3 * 7 = 21.

Finally, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 + 21 = 621.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The new price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we first need to determine how many songs he has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to determine the number of oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5. 

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 * 10 = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. If her shoes cost $80, we can represent the cost of the handbag as an algebraic expression.

Let's denote the cost of the handbag as 'x'. We know that the cost of the handbag is $20 less than 3 times the cost of the shoes. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x = 3(80) - 20

To solve for 'x', we first calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes:

3(80) = 240

Now, we subtract $20 from this result:

x = 240 - 20
x = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total hours James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 
So, miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed over 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to convert this to the number of bags, where each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To do this, we divide the total amount of oats by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"Let's denote Brett's current age as B and Angela's current age as A. We are given that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be expressed as:

A + 4 = 3(B)

We also know that Brett is currently 14 years old, so we can substitute B = 14 into the equation:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

A = 38

"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up the equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost), and the cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge). Since the second venue includes food in the price, we don't need to add any additional cost for food.

The equation to find the break-even point is:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides to isolate the variable:

200 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20 to solve for x:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting B represent the number of insects Bodhi found. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We are also given that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by the three is 43, so we can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/4 to get the yards used by Mariah:
364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Next, let's find the yards used by her grandma. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/2 to get the yards used by her grandma:
364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

"Let's break down the problem step by step using algebra.

Let's denote the width of the chair as 'c', the width of the rug as 'r', and the length of the couch as 'l'.

Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we have:
c = 3

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so we can express the width of the rug as:
r = c + 5
r = 3 + 5
r = 8

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can express this as:
l = 2r + 2

Substituting the value of r, we get:
l = 2(8) + 2
l = 16 + 2
l = 18

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Suzie bought a total of 4 packs of gum. Out of these, 2 packs are strawberry gum, 1 pack is grape gum, and 1 pack is green apple gum.

The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can represent the total cost as the sum of the costs of all the packs of gum. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick to make popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood.

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, the cost is $4 and the number of sticks is 200. Therefore, the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, the cost is $6 and the number of sticks is 400. Therefore, the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Comparing the two options, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the most cost-effective option for Frederick is to buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood, which will give him a total of 1600 popsicle sticks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"

"To find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at each location.

The farm has 30 cows. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals is the sum of the animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4(12 + 4)

Simplifying the equation:
x + y = 4(16)
x + y = 64

We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 64
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y
16 = 4x + 4y

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can simply use the equation x + y = 64.

Since we know that x + y = 64, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 64
x = 64 - y

Substituting the value of x in the equation x + y = 64:
(64 - y) + y = 64
64 = 64

This equation is true for any value of y. However, we know that Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can set y = 4 and find the value of x:
x + 4 = 64
x = 60

So, Sophia bought 60 onions and 4 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to achieve this goal.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000."

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has:
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3 and then divide by 5:

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to determine the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and then subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

First, we add the number of loaves sold in the morning and the afternoon: 93 + 39 = 132.

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves baked: 200 - 132 = 68.

However, we also need to account for the 6 loaves returned by the grocery store. Since these loaves were returned, they are still part of the initial number of loaves baked. Therefore, we need to add the returned loaves to the result: 68 + 6 = 74.

The number of loaves of bread left is 74."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's find the daily and weekly consumption before adding the device. Since Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Next, let's find the daily and weekly consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so the total daily consumption is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. The weekly consumption after adding the device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

The cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

Now, we can find the difference in weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the proportional relationship between the number of people and the time it takes to paint a house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can establish a ratio of 1 person to 5 days for painting half a house. 

Now, if we have 5 people, the ratio becomes 5 people to x days. Since the number of people has increased by a factor of 5, the time it takes to paint half a house should decrease by the same factor. Therefore, the time it takes for 5 people to paint half a house is 5 / 5 = 1 day.

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C and the number of sofas she has as S. We are given that S = 20 and C = S + 2. 

We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has is 3C. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is 3C - 2.

We can now set up a system of equations to solve for C and S:

C = S + 2
3C = 3(S + 2)

Substituting S = 20 into the first equation, we get:
C = 20 + 2
C = 22

Now, substitute C = 22 into the second equation:
3(22) = 3(S + 2)
66 = 3S + 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:
60 = 3S

Divide both sides by 3:
20 = S

Now that we have S, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
C = S + 2
C = 20 + 2
C = 22

Now that we have the number of chairs and sofas Ophelia has, we can find the number of chairs and sofas Jenna has:
Jenna's chairs: 3C = 3(22) = 66
Jenna's sofas: 3C - 2 = 3(22) - 2 = 64

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to determine the number of CDs he could have purchased with the money spent on the headphone set.

Let's denote the cost of one CD as 'c' and the cost of the headphone set as 'h'. We know that Tom spent a total of $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. Therefore, we can express the total cost as:

c + h = 48
c = 4

Substituting the value of 'c' into the first equation, we get:

4 + h = 48
h = 44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought = h / c
= 44 / 4
= 11

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.

Total money = 48
Cost of one CD = 4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
= 48 / 4
= 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that could have been bought
= 12 - 1
= 11

However, this is incorrect. We need to find the difference between the number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set and the number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set and the CD. 

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set
= 11

However, this is still incorrect. We need to find the difference between the number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set and the number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set and the CD. 

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set - 1
= 11 - 1
= 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios. 

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

Next, we'll calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 5 hours. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Then, we'll calculate the total hours for the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C. 

We are given two pieces of information:

1. In 5 years, Jame will be 27, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5.

Substituting J = 22 into the second equation, we get:
C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 60 - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
Difference = J - C
          = 22 - 47
          = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
Difference = | -25 |
          = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M. We are given the following information:

1. C + 2M + P = 2400 (Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer)
2. C = 1100 (Cost of the computer)
3. P = C - 400 (Cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer)

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for P:
P = 1100 - 400
P = 700

Now, we can substitute the values of C and P into the first equation:
1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400

Combine like terms:
1800 + 2M = 2400

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2M = 600

Divide both sides by 2:
M = 300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of boys and girls. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60.

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, which gives us 300. So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to the additional seashells brought by the girls: 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Let G represent the initial number of candies George had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can represent the initial number of candies Nick had as 2G.

We are given that George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left. This can be represented as G - 5 = 3.

To find the value of G, we can solve the equation G - 5 = 3 by adding 5 to both sides:

G - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5
G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the initial number of candies Nick had by multiplying 2G:

2G = 2(8)
2G = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Anne's age, we need to determine Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny's age = 10
Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of vlogs she aims to make and the number of vlogs she has already created.

The total number of vlogs Emma aims to make is 72. She has created 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

To find the total number of vlogs created so far, we add the vlogs made in each week: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we subtract the total vlogs created from the total vlogs Emma aims to make: 72 - 54 = 18.

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

The total amount you paid is $60."
"To find the final amount the eldest boy has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

First, we divide the total amount ($18) by the number of boys (3) to find the eldest boy's initial share: $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he adds $5 to his share, resulting in $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he adds another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he then spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Let's assume Elvis saves y dollars per day in the first half. Then, he wants to save twice as much in the second half, which is 2y dollars per day.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

We are given that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30. This equation is true for any value of x, but we can use it to find the value of x. We know that x + (30 - x) = 30, so we can rewrite this as 2x = 30 - (30 - x), which simplifies to 2x = x.

"To find the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we need to calculate their individual totals and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. 
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. 
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we calculate the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total.
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we need to multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week, which is 5. 

6 * 5 = 30 miles.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 + 65 = 130 letters.

The total number of letters Elise has written is 130.

"This is a classic example of a geometric sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number, known as the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 3.

Let's break it down:

- In the first round, 3 families are notified.
- In the second round, 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified.
- In the third round, 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified.
- In the fourth round, 27 * 3 = 81 families are notified.

This pattern follows the formula for a geometric sequence: a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

Using this formula, we can find the number of families notified in the fourth round by substituting a_1 = 3, r = 3, and n = 4:

a_4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a_4 = 3 * 3^3
a_4 = 3 * 27
a_4 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Larger set = 5 * James's set
Larger set = 5 * 80
Larger set = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, the correct answer is 398.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is 1 * $12 = $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is 1 * $10 = $10.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30.
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we first need to find the cost of each item. 

Five hamburgers at $4 each will be 5 x $4 = $20.
Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each will be 10 x $0.30 = $3.
Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each will be 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Since Carly pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill to find the change: $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission. This is calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission. The sales over $1000 are $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000 to get the total commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. 

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles for his guests.

In total, Bill needs 140 (for guests) + 48 (he already has) = 188 bottles.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day and then calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

First, let's find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does on a cold day. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now that we know it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile on a hot day, we can find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it takes him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles. On a hot day, it takes him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

To find the difference in time between the two days, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both subs. 

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Since the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost.

Total cost for both subs: $40 + $120 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to consider the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes.

There are 7 buttons with 2 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The remaining buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to determine the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size by dividing 24 by 2.

24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches, we can find Peter's locker size by taking 1/4 of Zack's locker size.

To find 1/4 of 12, we can multiply 12 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 12 by 4.

12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. 

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the sun's movement. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour relative to Sahir's house.

Given that the sun moves for 10 hours, we can calculate the total angle it moves by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours: 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Now, we add this angle to the initial angle of the pyramid to find the final angle from the ground to the sun: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

The final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees."
"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we must first calculate the combined age of his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles needed is the sum of their ages: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages read in the first week and add it to the total pages read in the second week.

First, let's find the total minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total minutes to pages. Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into parts.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given the following information:

1. R = M + 20
2. R = A + 45
3. R = 80

From equation 1, we can express M in terms of R:
M = R - 20

Substituting R = 80 into the equation, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

From equation 2, we can express A in terms of R:
A = R - 45

Substituting R = 80 into the equation, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the bread cost and the cheese and condiments cost: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, the total revenue is 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00.

The total cost for 10 sandwiches is 10 sandwiches * $3.30 per sandwich = $33.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit: Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons used per muffin crayon. 

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Now, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons used per muffin crayon: 192 / 8 = 24.

Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the cost of labor.

First, we find the area of the bedroom by multiplying its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet, which is $12 per square foot. So, the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, we add the costs of the materials: $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (old carpet removal) = $3888.

Then, we add the costs of the labor: $864 (old carpet removal) + $7344 (new carpet installation) = $8208.

Finally, we add the total cost of the materials and labor to get the overall cost: $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

The final answer is: $12196"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds seen = 280

Now, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:
Number of days = 7

Average birds per day = Total birds seen / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we can represent the starting value as 'x'. According to the problem, the starting value plus half the number is x + (1/2)x = (3/2)x. This expression is then divided by 5, resulting in ((3/2)x) / 5 = (3/10)x. 

Next, we multiply this value by the starting value minus 12, which is (3/10)x * (x - 12). To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately: (3x(x - 12)) / 10.

Now, we substitute the given starting value of 20 into the expression: (3(20)(20 - 12)) / 10 = (3(20)(8)) / 10 = (240) / 10 = 24.

The final value of the number train is 24."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we need to determine the number of cards each of them has and add them together.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to understand the relationship between the set temperature and the actual temperature. The oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, which means the difference between the set and actual temperatures is proportional to the set temperature.

Let's denote the set temperature as 'x'. The actual temperature is x + (percentage of x). We know that when the set temperature is 450, the actual temperature is 468. This means the percentage of 450 is 18.

To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. This means the oven is off by 4% of the set temperature.

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. We can use the same percentage to find the difference between the set and actual temperatures.

The difference is 4% of 520, which is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

To find the temperature she should set the oven to, we subtract the difference from the actual temperature. However, since we are looking for the set temperature, we need to find the set temperature that would result in an actual temperature of 520. 

Let's denote the set temperature as 'x'. The actual temperature is x + (4% of x). We know that the actual temperature is 520, so we can set up the equation: x + (4/100)x = 520.

Combine like terms: (1.04)x = 520

Divide both sides by 1.04: x = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought and then add them together.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the contacts. The original price of 2 boxes is $200, and there is a 10% discount:
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories burned from her activities.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she spends 2 hours doing aerobics. So, the calories burned from aerobics are 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she spends 1 hour running. So, the calories burned from running are 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned are the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are. This is 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total amount of water needed. This is 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can express this as an equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Each of the 100 invited people will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, we consider the people invited by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, so the total number of people invited by Alex's friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of people invited by Alex's friends to get the total number of people attending: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her.

Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

"To find the total protein intake per week, we first need to determine the protein content in the amount of mushrooms John eats daily. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage as follows: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily. To find the daily protein intake, we multiply the weight of mushrooms by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Colby has, we need to calculate the value of his coins in cents.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins.

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15
= 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt: 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.5

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.5 = $17.5

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.5 + $35 = $52.5

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase:
Amount left = $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we find the amount of butter needed per croissant. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the amount of butter per croissant, we divide the amount of butter per dozen by 12:
(1/4 pound/dozen) / 12 croissants/dozen = 1/48 pound/croissant

Now, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per croissant:
336 croissants * (1/48 pound/croissant) = 7 pounds

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. This means the increased funding is 1.5 times the initial funding, or 150% of the initial funding. 

The increased funding per month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months:
$100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the amount eaten by each player. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) = 14 ounces
14 ounces + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

There are 31 days in March. 

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. 
So, the total number of posts per day is 1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day.

Now, multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 
3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts.

The final answer is: 93000"
"To determine the total cost of water used for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which translates to 52 * 2 = 104 times in a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

We also need to add the cost of the fish food, which is $2.00.

Lastly, we need to add the cost of the aquarium, which is $10.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 + $5.00 = $15.00
$15.00 + $6.00 = $21.00
$21.00 + $10.00 = $31.00

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to determine the total number of seats. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we can calculate the total as follows:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we calculate the remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Then, we find the number of seats occupied by the parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we determine the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to calculate the total number of street lights first and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

First, we find the total number of poles at all intersections. Since each intersection has 6 poles and there are 4 intersections, the total number of poles is 6 * 4 = 24.

Each pole has 4 street lights, so the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 of these street lights are not functioning. To find the total number of functioning lights, we subtract the non-functioning lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find out how many pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we divide the total school hours by 2.

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

In addition to the gum chewed at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces chewed is 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6.

Now, we subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial amount of gum Jim had: 20 - 6 = 14

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives away, we divide the remaining gum by 2: 14 / 2 = 7

Since Jim gives away 7 pieces, we subtract that from the remaining gum: 14 - 7 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to determine her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

"To find the difference in the amounts spent by the two coaches, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb/s to Mb/h, we need to perform a two-step conversion.

First, we convert kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000, since 1 Mb = 1000 kb.
20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we convert Mb/s to Mb/h by multiplying by the number of seconds in an hour, which is 3600.
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

"To determine James' earnings, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total cost: 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we find the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit: 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get the total number of riders who can stay upright:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find the number of men who can stay upright. Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we can start by defining the price of the diamond jewel as 'd'. Given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can express the price of the gold jewel as (4/5)d.

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can express the price of the silver jewel as (4/5)d - 400.

We are given that the price of the diamond jewel is $2000, so we can substitute this value into our expressions for the gold and silver jewels:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5)d
= (4/5) * 2000
= 1600

Price of silver jewel = (4/5)d - 400
= (4/5) * 2000 - 400
= 1600 - 400
= 1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = d + (4/5)d + (4/5)d - 400
= d + (8/5)d - 400
= (13/5)d - 400

Substituting the value of d = 2000 into the equation, we get:

Total price = (13/5) * 2000 - 400
= 2600 - 400
= 2200

However, this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the equation for the total price:

Total price = d + (4/5)d + (4/5)d - 400
= d + (8/5)d - 400
= (13/5)d - 400

Substituting the value of d = 2000 into the equation, we get:

Total price = (13/5) * 2000 - 400
= 5200 - 400
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck and rose stamps. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed between them and the distance between their current positions.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. The distance covered by Tom in 't' hours is given by his speed multiplied by time, which is 70t miles. The distance covered by Bob in the same time is given by his speed multiplied by time, which is 55t miles.

Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead of Tom, the distance covered by Bob in 't' hours is 75 miles more than the distance covered by Tom. This can be represented by the equation:

70t = 55t + 75

Subtracting 55t from both sides of the equation gives us:

15t = 75

Dividing both sides of the equation by 15 gives us:

t = 5

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of fish Tommy caught, we need to determine the number of fish Darren caught first. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from 17.

Darren's catch = 17 - 6 = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = 11 + 3 = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends at $6 per class as x and the number of classes he attends at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

The equation representing this situation is 6x + 10y = 60.

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

If x = 6, 6(6) + 10y = 60
36 + 10y = 60
10y = 24
y = 2.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 7, 6(7) + 10y = 60
42 + 10y = 60
10y = 18
y = 1.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 8, 6(8) + 10y = 60
48 + 10y = 60
10y = 12
y = 1.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 9, 6(9) + 10y = 60
54 + 10y = 60
10y = 6
y = 0.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 10, 6(10) + 10y = 60
60 + 10y = 60
10y = 0
y = 0

Since x = 10 and y = 0 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 10 classes at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

However, this is the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class, and his parents will not sign him up again if he attends more than 10 classes. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 10 - 10 = 0 classes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as L, the number of miles Paisley ran as P, and the number of miles Reggie ran as R.

We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so R = 5P = 5(4) = 20.

Additionally, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3.

To find the value of L, we need to isolate L. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get L = 20 - 3 = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the cost of 5 apples, we first need to determine the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, we divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple.
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Now, we multiply the cost of one apple by 5 to find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange.
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10
Now, we multiply the cost of one orange by 5 to find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

Volume = length * width * depth

Given the dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now that we know the volume of the hole, we can calculate the time it will take Bob to dig it. Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's new monthly salary, we need to calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. This can be done by multiplying $20,000 by 0.05, which equals $1,000. Adding this to his original salary, we get a new monthly salary of $21,000.

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. This is found by dividing $20,000 by 2, resulting in a bonus of $10,000.

Now, we calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus, which equals $31,000.

To find the total annual income, we multiply the total monthly income by 12, resulting in $372,000.

Since Howie is getting 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2:
27 * 2 = 54

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we are given that she received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we need to add these new likes to the number of likes after 3 weeks. 

The total number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, and the number of likes received in the 3 weeks is 140000 - 2000 = 138000. However, we are given that she received 20000 new likes recently, not 138000. The 20000 new likes are in addition to the 140000 likes after 3 weeks.

So, the total number of likes is 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as x. Since the sales from red hats in the first month are half the total sales from green hats, we can express it as x/2 = $400.

To find the value of x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = $400 * 2 = $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from green and red hats, which is $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, the sales are 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage, we need to determine the number of paid hours and the cost of each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost of the first hour is $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

First, let's calculate the expected total in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves. 

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To find the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine 2/3 of the total pages since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper.

The total number of pages is 15. To find 1/3 of 15, we multiply 15 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 15 by 3.

15 / 3 = 5

Since Shiela has already written 5 pages, we need to find 2/3 of 15 to determine the number of pages left to write. To do this, we multiply 15 by 2/3, which is the same as dividing 15 by 3 and then multiplying by 2.

(15 / 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"

1. R = 30 minutes (given)
2. P = R + 20 minutes
3. B = (R + P) / 2

Substituting the value of R into equation (2), we get:
P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes

Now, substitute the values of R and P into equation (3):
B = (30 + 50) / 2
B = 80 / 2
B = 40 minutes

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to cook all the food, which is the sum of R, P, and B:
Total time = R + P + B
Total time = 30 + 50 + 40
Total time = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

We are given two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70 (the total number of animal legs)
2) S + G = 20 (the total number of animal heads)

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the amount of money Aurelia has as A, the amount Kassidy has as K, and the amount Rayna has as R.

We are given that Aurelia has $120, so A = 120.

We are also given that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so K = (3/4)A = (3/4)(120) = 90.

We are also given that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so R = K + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together and divide it by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared it equally.

Total money = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. The total number of dogs is now 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37.

"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to establish the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 6:36. To simplify, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. This simplifies the ratio to 1:6.

Now, we can use this simplified ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes. We set up a proportion: 1 potato / 6 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns.

Cross-multiplying, we get 1x = 96 * 6. Solving for x, we find x = 576.

Therefore, the correct answer is 576 hash browns.

"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, Max has x + 12 cookies. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so she has (x + 12) - 5 cookies. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has (x + 12) + 23 cookies.

We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation (x + 12) - 5 = 68 to solve for x.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 7 = 68. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get x = 61. 

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. Max has 61 + 12 = 73 cookies, and Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to consider the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

First, let's convert the time in turtle mode to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the time in turtle mode is 60 minutes.

Next, we have the time in rabbit mode, which is given as 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of one of the twins. Given that the older twin is 7 years older than the younger twin, we can calculate the age of the older twin as follows:

The age of the older twin = T + 7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the cost of one lollipop as L and the cost of one candy as C. We are given that the cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. This can be represented as:

5L + 4C = 3.20

We are also given that the cost of one lollipop is $0.40. This can be represented as:

L = 0.40

Now, we can substitute the value of L into the first equation:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2.00 + 4C = 3.20

Subtracting 2.00 from both sides, we get:

4C = 1.20

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

C = 0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10L = 10(0.40) = 4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10C = 10(0.30) = 3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it.

First, let's find the cost of one banana, which is twice as much as an apple. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

The number of red squares is 14. 
The number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
The number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
The number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 + 18 = 32
32 + 24 = 56
56 + 12 = 68

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get, we first need to find out how many regular chairs it has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed:

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to first determine the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this by multiplying 50 (the total number of deer) by 0.5 (50 percent as a decimal).

50 * 0.5 = 25

Now that we know there are 25 bucks, we need to find 20 percent of this number to determine the number of 8-point bucks. We can do this by multiplying 25 by 0.2 (20 percent as a decimal).

25 * 0.2 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. To find Tom's points, we subtract 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Martha's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils available. Since the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity.

Total capacity of the box = 20 pencils
Pencils missing = 4

Number of pencils in the box = Total capacity of the box - Pencils missing
= 20 - 4
= 16

Now, we calculate the number of pairs of pencils by dividing the total number of pencils by 2, as a pair consists of 2 pencils.

Number of pairs of pencils = Number of pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is the decimal equivalent of 40%. This gives us 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display: 120 + 15 = 135.

"Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as H, and Gary's truck as Y. We are given the following information:

1. G = 4,000 pounds
2. H = G + 800 pounds
3. G + H + Y = 11,600 pounds

We can substitute the value of G into the second equation to find H:
H = 4,000 + 800
H = 4,800 pounds

Now, we can substitute the values of G and H into the third equation to find Y:
4,000 + 4,800 + Y = 11,600

Combine like terms:
8,800 + Y = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:
Y = 11,600 - 8,800
Y = 2,800 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we need to determine the total number of dumplings eaten by the group of friends.

First, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Next, we need to find the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we can find the total number of dumplings eaten by the group by adding the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to determine the fraction of the cat's speed that the turtle's speed represents. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, the turtle's speed is 1/5 of the cat's speed.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = (1/5) * Speed of the cat
Speed of the turtle = (1/5) * 15
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they need to raise per hour. 

The amount raised in the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first determine the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for industrial purposes is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 8%."

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to establish the production rates of each type of ice cream.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. This gives us a ratio of 100:2 for chocolate ice cream production. To simplify, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us a simplified ratio of 50:1 for chocolate ice cream production.

Similarly, the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. This gives us a ratio of 50:4 for vanilla ice cream production. Dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, we get a simplified ratio of 25:2 for vanilla ice cream production.

Now, we can use these simplified ratios to find the production rates per hour for each type of ice cream. The production rate of chocolate ice cream is 50 quarts per hour, and the production rate of vanilla ice cream is 25 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, the total quarts of chocolate ice cream made would be 50 * 48 = 2400.
In 48 hours, the total quarts of vanilla ice cream made would be 25 * 48 = 1200.

The total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours would be 2400 + 1200 = 3600.

"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- 5 croissants at $3.00 each: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.10 (which is the decimal equivalent of 10%): $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To determine the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 scoop free.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 scoops: 2 scoops * $1.50 = $3.00. Since Erin gets 1 scoop free with every 2 scoops purchased, the effective cost per 3 scoops is $3.00.

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is a total of 2 * 3 = 6 scoops.

However, Erin has $1.50 remaining after buying 2 sets of 3 scoops. This remaining amount can be used to buy 1 more scoop.

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To determine the difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in that time period and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries, we need to calculate the cost of picking them and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound, which is $1.5. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound multiplied by 30 pounds, which equals $75.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people. Since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we know that the two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the number of slices eaten by all 5 people to find the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total, the total number of slices is:

5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, we know that Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and the two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since 2/3 is less than ¾, the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas must have eaten more slices than the other 3 people. This means that the total number of slices eaten by the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas (18 slices) must be more than the total number of slices eaten by the other 3 people (24 slices). This is only possible if the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas ate more than 9 slices each, which is not possible since they ate ¾ of their pizzas. Therefore, the correct calculation is that the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas ate 9 slices each, and the other 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- Number of students' cars: 64
- Number of windows per car: 4
- Fraction of windows smashed: 1/4
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- Number of teachers' cars: 32
- Number of windows per car: 2
- Fraction of windows smashed: 3/4
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of light blue and dark blue spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60.

The total number of spools is the sum of all the spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday.
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, let's find the number of people remaining after midday. 
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remained.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people voted by 16:00, but we need to subtract the people who voted by 16:00 from the total, not the people who voted by midday. 
5000 - 2000 (voted by midday) - 2000 (voted by 16:00) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we must first calculate the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days. This can be found by multiplying the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days: 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces.

Next, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find the number of packs needed: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 / 3 = 1.

"Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We are given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be expressed as F = 2D + 8.

We are also given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, which can be expressed as M = F - 4.

Since Dora is 15 years old, we can substitute D = 15 into the first equation to find her father's age: F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Now that we have F, we can find her mother's age by substituting F into the second equation: M = 38 - 4 = 34.

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together: D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first need to find the total number of students required for 12 groups. 

Since each group will have the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the number of students per group.

Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6
Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we multiply the number of groups required by the students per group to find the total number of students needed.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading her small stickers. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Next, we need to find out how many small buttons she gets from trading her large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, but we are interested in the remaining large stickers that she trades for small buttons. Since she has 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them, she trades 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers for large buttons. This means she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left to trade for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 60 small buttons from trading large stickers, and 20 large buttons from trading large stickers. However, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons to get a total count. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she has 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large buttons. Now, we can add up the small buttons: 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

"Let's dive into the problem at hand. We're given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one third of the Pomeranians are girls. We're also told that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we've found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so they sold a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so they sold a total of 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already made from the total amount he wants to make:

Total amount from corn = Total desired amount - Amount from eggplants
Total amount from corn = $135 - $60
Total amount from corn = $75

Now, we know that Bennet has 25 ears of corn and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn by the number of ears of corn:

Price per ear of corn = Total amount from corn / Number of ears of corn
Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25
Price per ear of corn = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first calculate the total time she has available and the time she spends playing soccer.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer:
Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we can calculate this by multiplying 50 (the total number of pencils) by 1/2.
   50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

2. Now, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony has left after giving 25 to Brandon. We subtract the number of pencils given to Brandon from the total number of pencils.
   50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

3. Next, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie. Since he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, we can calculate this by multiplying 25 (the remaining number of pencils) by 3/5.
   25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony kept. We subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining number of pencils.
   25 - 15 = 10 pencils kept.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum and back. Since the distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

The total time Jack spends driving is the sum of the time to drive to the museum and the time to drive back home: 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Next, we add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys and then subtract that from the initial number of wheels in the box.

First, let's find the total number of wheels needed for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we calculate 1/3 of 600:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * 6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we calculate 40% of 400:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * 5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * 10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

First, let's calculate the cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Next, we calculate the cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Then, we determine the cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

Let's denote the driving speed as 'd' and the hiking speed as 'h'. We know that the driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so d = 50.

The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Half the driving speed is d/2, so the hiking speed is (d/2) - 5. Substituting d = 50, we get h = (50/2) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

The time they drove is 6 hours, and the time they hiked is 1.5 hours. The distance they drove is given by the formula distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is d * 6 = 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

The distance they hiked is also given by the formula distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is h * 1.5 = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. The total distance is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's denote Emma's score as x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is 30(60 - (x + 4)) = 30(56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

The total score for Emma is x.

The total score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (1680 - 30x) = 2x + 8 + 3 + 1680 - 30x = -28x + 1691.

The difference in their scores is (-28x + 1691) - x = -29x + 1691.

However, we don't have any information about the value of x. We can find the difference in their scores by finding the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (x + 4)) - 30(60 - x) = 30(-4) = -120.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 120 = -109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-109}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This gives us a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. 

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can solve the first equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption cost, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a week and then convert it to gallons, considering the car's fuel efficiency.

The distance between home and office is 5 miles, and since Andy travels this distance twice a day, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

For a 5-day workweek, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Given the price of regular gas is $3/gallon, the total weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to determine the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since she has 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and divide by 5: (10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties.

The value of the 6 twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are divided into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. It is given that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find this, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction of groups that brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month
220 employees * $4000 = $880,000 per month
240 employees * $4000 = $960,000 per month
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 + $1,040,000 = $3,680,000

However, the question asks for the total amount paid after three months, which is the sum of the salaries for the three months. The correct total is the sum of the salaries for the three months, not the sum of the salaries for four months. The correct total is:

"To determine the hours Kris still needs to play, we first need to calculate the total hours she has played.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then calculate the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

To calculate the premium, we need to find 30% of $900. This can be done by multiplying $900 by 0.3, which is the decimal equivalent of 30%. 

0.3 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to find the final cost.

$900 + $270 = $1170

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students and then add it to the amount of tea left.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total amount of tea drank from quarts to gallons. 

38 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 9.5 gallons.

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea drank and the tea left. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the amount of tea left from quarts to gallons. 

10 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 2.5 gallons.

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 9.5 gallons (tea drank) + 2.5 gallons (tea left) = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to determine his total number of candies. Initially, he ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies. To find out how many candies he had left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies: 100 - 150 = -50. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. 

This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. He then ordered 100 more candies. So, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies: 100 + 100 = 200. 

Now, we subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"The problem describes a classic example of exponential growth, where the number of students doubles every month. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

To calculate the number of students at the end of May, we apply the doubling factor 5 times (January to May).

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the total number of marshmallows left after accounting for those used and dropped.

First, let's find the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag to find the number of marshmallows left. The bag initially had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine how many S'mores each kid can have. Therefore, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

First, let's convert the total time played from hours to minutes. 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time played by each person. Jack plays for 240 minutes. Two of his friends play for half the time, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"

First, let's add the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes Paul already has: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can express this relationship as an equation: J = 2R, where J is the number of cars Joe has and R is the number of cars Robert has. Given that R = 20, we can substitute this value into the equation to find J: J = 2(20) = 40.

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars Joe sells. He sells 20% of his cars, which can be expressed as 0.2J. Substituting the value of J, we get 0.2(40) = 8.

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe gives away. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2(8) = 16.

To find the total number of cars Joe gives away, we add the number of cars he sold and the number of cars he gave away: 8 + 16 = 24.

Finally, to find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to determine the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35.

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to determine her points in both games and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 
In the same game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

For the second game, Sasha struggled and scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs: 5.

Next, we know Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so the number of blue eggs is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we're told she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so the number of yellow eggs is 9 / 3 = 3.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then add them together.

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 0.35 * 4 = $1.40. The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is 0.08 * 20 = $1.60. The total cost of shipping is 1.40 + 1.60 = $2.99.

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price, which is 0.75 * 32 = $24. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total cost of shipping: $2.99
Refund amount: $24
Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.

She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and calculate the time spent on each.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time Britany spends on makeup per week: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends on recording videos per week: 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes.

Now, we'll add up the time spent on each activity per week: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert the total weekly time to hours, we'll divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we'll multiply the total weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

"To find the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to determine the amount he saved in excess of Anthony's savings, which is 40% of Anthony's total.

First, we know that Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.  Therefore, Anthony has saved $20 + $10 = $30.

To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4: $30 * 0.4 = $12.

Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's total to find Roy's savings: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to break down the given information step by step.

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Therefore, Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, we are told that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, their time to travel the same distance will be twice as long.

Given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway by multiplying 18 hours by 3. This gives us 54 hours for one kangaroo.

Now, since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 to find the time it takes for one turtle. This gives us 54 * 2 = 108 hours for one turtle.

Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one turtle by 4 to find the total time for all four turtles. This gives us 108 * 4 = 432 hours.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the speed of the turtles is half that of the kangaroos, so the time it takes for the four turtles to travel across the highway will be twice that of the time it takes for the three kangaroos. Therefore, the correct answer is 18 * 2 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's denote the number of clay dishes Kora made as K, the number of clay dishes Rory made as R, and the number of clay dishes Jada made as J.

We are given the following information:
1. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so J = 2R.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so R = K + 20.
3. Kora made 20 dishes, so K = 20.

We can substitute the value of K into the second equation to find R:
R = 20 + 20
R = 40

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the first equation to find J:
J = 2R
J = 2 * 40
J = 80

To find the total number of clay dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
Total = K + R + J
Total = 20 + 40 + 80
Total = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: 
$400 + $50 = $450

Since Erika received $230, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is: 
$450 - $230 = $220

"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large and small apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, we'll find the number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large and small apples together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is: 30 - 15 = 15

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find the total milk production rate per cow. The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow.

To find the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we divide the desired milk production (25 liters) by the milk production rate per cow (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the required number of cows and the number of cows he already has.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6, which is equivalent to 12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3, which is equivalent to 12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2, which is equivalent to 12 * (1/2) = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions together: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

"Let's denote the number of socks Jack collected as S and the number of dishes Jack collected as D. We are given the following information:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so D = 2S.
3. From the second equation, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation D = 2S, which gives us 60 = 2S. Solving for S, we get S = 60 / 2 = 30.
4. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks = 2S = 2 * 30 = 60.
5. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes = D / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 180."
"Let's analyze the given information using set theory principles.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students good at both math and English, denoted as |A ∩ B|.

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
20 = 5 + 8 - |A ∩ B|
|A ∩ B| = 5

Now, we need to find the total number of students good at math, which is |A| + |A ∩ B|.

|A| + |A ∩ B| = 5 + 5

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. The students who are good at both math and English are already included in the count of students good at math only. Therefore, we need to add the students who are good at both math and English to the students who are good at math only.

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to understand that this is a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

However, in this case, the interest is directly added to the principal each year, so we can calculate the total amount by adding the interest to the principal for each year.

Year 1: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
Year 2: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
Year 3: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

The number of white shirts with no collars is then 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Given that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

To find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation.

Since x = 8.75, we can try x = 8 or x = 9.

If x = 8, then my brother's age is 8 + 3 = 11, my sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(11) - 1 = 32.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 - 1 = 56, which is less than 87.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 - 1 = 62, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 10. If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 - 1 = 68, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 11. If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 - 1 = 74, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 12. If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44.

The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 - 1 = 80, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 13. If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 - 1 = 86, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 14. If x = 14, then my brother's age is 14 + 3 = 17, my sister's age is 14 - 2 = 12, and my mom's age is 3(17) - 1 = 50.

The sum of our ages is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 - 1 = 92, which is greater than 87.

Since x = 14 results in a sum greater than 87, we can conclude that x must be less than 14. Let's try x = 13.

Number of packs required: 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. To do this, we can multiply 6.75 by 1 to get 6.75, then subtract 6 to get 0.75, and then round up by adding 1 to get 1.75, then round up by adding 1 to get 2, then multiply 2 by 8 to get 16, then subtract 54 to get -38, then divide -38 by 8 to get -4.75, then round up by adding 2 to get 6.75, then multiply 6.75 by 8 to get 54, then subtract 48 to get 6. However, we can also round up by simply adding 1 to 6 to get 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on each day and add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"The classic example of exponential growth. When a plague infects ten people and each infected person infects six others every day, we can model this situation using the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t, where N(t) is the total number of people infected after t days, N0 is the initial number of people infected, r is the growth rate (in this case, 6), and t is the time in days.

However, in this scenario, we need to consider the cumulative effect of the initial 10 people and the new infections each day. A more accurate approach is to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the initial amount (10 people), r is the growth rate (6/7, since each person infects 6 others, leaving 1 person uninfected), and n is the number of days.

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = 10 * (1 - (6/7)^3) / (1 - 6/7)
S = 10 * (1 - (216/343)) / (1/7)
S = 10 * (127/343) / (1/7)
S = 10 * (127/343) * 7
S = 10 * 127 / 49
S = 1270 / 49
S = 25.96 (approximately)

However, since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can calculate the exact number of people infected after three days using the formula for the sum of a geometric series with a finite number of terms:
S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) + a * r * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)^2 + a * r^2 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)^3
S = 10 * (1 - (6/7)^3) / (1 - 6/7) + 10 * (6/7) * (1 - (6/7)^3) / (1 - 6/7)^2 + 10 * (6/7)^2 * (1 - (6/7)^3) / (1 - 6/7)^3
S = 10 * (127/343) / (1/7) + 10 * (6/7) * (127/343) / (1/49) + 10 * (36/49) * (127/343) / (1/343)
S = 10 * (127/343) * 7 + 10 * (6/7) * (127/343) * 49 + 10 * (36/49) * (127/343) * 343
S = 10 * 127 / 49 + 10 * 6 * 127 / 7 * 49 / 343 + 10 * 36 * 127 / 49 * 343 / 343
S = 1270 / 49 + 10 * 6 * 127 / 343 + 10 * 36 * 127 / 49
S = 1270 / 49 + 762 / 49 + 4572 / 49
S = 5504 / 49
S = 112.08 (approximately)

However, since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can calculate the exact number of people infected after three days using the formula for the sum of a geometric series with a finite number of terms:
S = 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 + 60 * (6^3 - 1) / (6 - 1)
S = 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 + 60 * 215 / 5
S = 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 + 2580
S = 10 + 60 + 360 + 4740
S = 5170

"To find the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to calculate the amount of money each of them received.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. So, Rafaela's total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1, which equals $80. 

Now, we subtract $80 from $800 to find Julieta's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is the sum of their individual tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only boy 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges earned by each person in a 1-year time frame.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges in a year.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so she earns half the number of badges Claire does in the same time frame. Therefore, Amber earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to determine the total number of slices Paige baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, we calculate the total number of slices baked. Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she baked for 5 hours, we multiply the number of loaves per hour by the number of hours:

2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so we multiply the total number of loaves by the number of slices per loaf:

10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Next, we convert the price per slice from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the price per slice by 100:

50 cents/slice ÷ 100 = $0.50/slice

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

First, let's find the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Next, we need to add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos to find the number of leftover burritos. There were 600 burritos initially, so the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y. We are given the following information:

1. R = 12 (number of red cars)
2. G = R - 2 (number of green cars)
3. B = 3G (number of blue cars)
4. R + G + B + Y = 75 (total number of cars)

Substituting the values from equations 1 and 2 into equation 4, we get:
12 + (12 - 2) + 3(12 - 2) + Y = 75

Simplifying the equation:
12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
52 + Y = 75

Now, we solve for Y:
Y = 75 - 52
Y = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given two equations:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can rewrite the first equation as S - A = 25.

We are also given that the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation S + A + F = 85.

Now, we can substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the third equation: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60

Now, substitute the expression for A from the second equation into this equation: 2(F - 12) + F = 60

Distribute the 2: 2F - 24 + F = 60

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total number of Jello cups needed, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 cups, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box to find the number of boxes required: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine his share of the monthly grocery cost. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

40% of $400 can be calculated by multiplying 0.4 by 400, which equals $160. This is the amount Keenan spends in a month.

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly expenditure by the number of weeks in the month, which is 4.

$160 / 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Next, he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to determine the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. To find the number of correct answers, we multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 10 * 0.8 = 8. Since each question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is 8.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. To find the number of correct answers, we multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 20 * 0.9 = 18.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can find the cost price by subtracting the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

"To find the number of years when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, let's denote the current age of Melanie as 'x'. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can express her current age as x = 18 - 10 = 8.

Now, we need to find the time 't' when her age will be thrice her current age, i.e., 3x. At that time, her age will be x + t. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + t = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

t = 2x

Since we know Melanie's current age is 8, we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

"To find the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

We know that the salad costs $6 and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3. The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

We can set up the equation: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's hourly wage was initially $10, but it was increased by $2. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and since she made the same amount per lawn, the total amount from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to determine the weights of Carl and Christian first.

Martin's weight is given as 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, which is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, the number of notebooks Joseph had is 3x.

We are given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which simplifies to x = 2.

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had: 3x = 3 * 2 = 6.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

Therefore, Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, who rowed 50 miles. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Susan started with 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to consider the capacity of the pot and the number of people eating dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children) eating dinner, 4 adult bowls will be used. This is equivalent to 4 child bowls, as 4 adult bowls = 4 child bowls.

After dinner, the number of child bowls left will be 8 - 4 = 4. Since there are 2 children, we divide the remaining child bowls by the number of children to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch.

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the material needed for small masks. Since 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks, we can set up a proportion to find the material needed for 20 small masks.

Let x be the material needed for 20 small masks. We can set up the proportion as follows:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

Now, let's find the material needed for large masks. Since 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, we can set up a proportion to find the material needed for 8 large masks.

Let y be the material needed for 8 large masks. We can set up the proportion as follows:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = y yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3y
18 = 3y
y = 18 / 3
y = 6 yards

Now, we can find the total material needed by adding the material for small and large masks:
Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we first need to determine the initial number of books he had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books Sarah has, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate Joseph's initial number of books by multiplying Sarah's number of books by 2.

Joseph's initial number of books = 9 * 2 = 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from his initial number of books to find the current number of books he has.

Joseph's current number of books = 18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away. 

First, let's find 1/5 of 30. To do this, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6. 

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial amount to find the remaining marbles. 

30 - 16 = 14

"Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as an equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
Since Duncan's current age is 60, we can write the equation as: 60 - 8 = 2x
52 = 2x
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

"To find Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we need to divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks.

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total profit from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. The price per lollipop is $0.8, and each student sold 10 lollipops. There are 30 students in total. 

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we need to find the total cost. The cost per lollipop is $0.5, and each student bought 10 lollipops. There are 30 students in total.

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops bought per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150

- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The total number of toys before buying bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of blocks = 31
Total number of stuffed animals = 8
Total number of stacking rings = 9

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9

"To find Peter's age, we can start by expressing Paul's age in terms of Jean's age. We are given that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write Paul's age as J + 10.

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age. Therefore, we can express Peter's age as (J + 10) + J.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation:

(J + 10) + J + J = 100

Combine like terms:

3J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3J = 90

Divide both sides by 3:

J = 30

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Pp = J + 10
Pp = 30 + 10
Pp = 40

Now that we have Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:

P = Pp + J
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

Zoey's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat is the sum of Zoey's and Sydney's total distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is the sum of the seeds spat by Zoey and Sydney: 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is calculated by dividing the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to break down the time he spends at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron chooses to pay for the additional hours after the 12-hour mark at a rate of 70 pesos per hour.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, we can calculate the cost of the additional hours as follows: 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours. The cost of the additional hours is 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of Cameron's stay by adding the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours: 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours instead of the 24-hour option, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option with additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let G be the amount each goat needs, and S be the amount each sheep needs. Then, we have:

S = 2G - 3

Given that G = 5, we can substitute this value into the equation to find S:

S = 2(5) - 3
S = 10 - 3
S = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, we need to calculate his total earnings, subtract the cost of gas and the deposit, and then divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen.

John's earnings: 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. So, the total amount he needs to subtract from his earnings is 50 + 100 = 150 dollars.

Remaining money: 300 - 150 = 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.

Cost of pencils: 5 * 10 = 50 dollars
Remaining money after buying pencils: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen.

Number of pens: 100 / 25 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles she received.

First, we find the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher received. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she got is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: 842"
"To calculate the total amount Patty charged, we need to break down the costs involved.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply this by the hourly rate of $35. 

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Cost of parts = $60

Lastly, we add the visit fee, which is $40.

Visit fee = $40

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total amount Patty charged.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find the total cost of the CDs, we first calculate the original price and then apply the discount.

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of:
5 * $40 = $200

To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the profit from the original cost of the CDs. However, since he made a profit, we need to consider the cost of the CDs he didn't sell.

Cost of 5 CDs he didn't sell = 5 * $15 = $75
Total cost of all CDs = $150
Profit from selling 5 CDs = $200
Profit after subtracting the cost of unsold CDs = $200 - $75 = $125

Now, we subtract the profit from the total cost to find the amount he was out:
Total cost - Profit = $150 - $125 = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from yams: 6 * $1.5 = $9.
Next, we'll calculate the earnings from sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20.
Then, we'll calculate the earnings from carrots: 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 = $29, and then $29 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Let's denote the total distance as D, James' swimming speed as S, and the time it takes to swim the entire distance as T. We know that D = 20 miles and S = 2 miles per hour.

First, James swims 60% of the distance, which is 0.6D. The time it takes him to swim this distance is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 0.6D / S
Time = 0.6D / 2
Time = 0.3D

Substituting D = 20 miles, we get:
Time = 0.3 * 20
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 60% of the distance, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 0.5 * 6 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is D - 0.6D = 0.4D. James swims this distance at half the speed, which is S / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time it takes to swim the remaining distance is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 0.4D / (S / 2)
Time = 0.4D / 1
Time = 0.4D

Substituting D = 20 miles, we get:
Time = 0.4 * 20
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 0.3D + 3 + 0.4D
Total time = 0.7D + 3

Substituting D = 20 miles, we get:
Total time = 0.7 * 20 + 3
Total time = 14 + 3
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to consider the stickers she received and the ones she lost.

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left after losing some, we subtract the number of stickers lost from the initial number of stickers: 15 - 7 = 8.

After losing some stickers, Jasmine received 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers she has at the end, we add the stickers she received for helping her classmates to the number of stickers she had left: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commissions together to find the total commission: 
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

"Let's denote Deanna's age as D, Marcus's age as M, and Leo's age as L. We are given the following information:

1. D = 26
2. M = D - 5
3. M = (1/2)L

Substituting the value of D from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:
M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, substituting the value of M into equation 3, we get:
21 = (1/2)L

To solve for L, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
2 * 21 = L
42 = L

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this to A - D = -10. 

Now, we have the equation A - D = -10. 

We can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + (D - 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the number of pages per inch and the thickness of the book.

Given that there are 100 pages to the inch and each page is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch as 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book to find the total number of pages: 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked:
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Her sleepwalking episode occurred from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 * 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract this from the total capacity:

1000 - 200 = 800

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this by the number of days in 2 weeks (14):

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds:

200 + 700 = 900

Finally, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 - 900 = 100

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then use that information to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We are given the equation A + S + L = 339, representing the total number of Pokémon caught by the three.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, which can be expressed as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe has caught, which can be written as S = 4A - 13.

Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get A + (S + 5) + S = 339, which simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Substituting the third equation into the previous one, we get A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339, which simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms, we get 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides, we get 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13, which gives us S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 10 hours: speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the last 5 hours: speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Then, we calculate the distance traveled in the 2 hours: speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's find the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. A dozen is a unit of 12, so we can directly use this value.

She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies.

She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Now, let's find the number of brownies eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received, we perform the following operation: 66 - 18 = 48

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats needed for the rectangular fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. 

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to determine the number of states in each country.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29.

So, India has 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R, the number of cherries Jerry has as J, and the total number of cherries as T. We are given that T = 60, R = 30, and R = J + 10.

We can express the total number of cherries as the sum of the cherries each person has: T = R + J. Substituting the given values, we get 60 = 30 + J.

To find the number of cherries Jerry has, we need to isolate J. Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get J = 60 - 30 = 30.

Now that we know J, we can find the difference between the number of cherries Robert and Jerry have. The difference is R - J = 30 - 30 = 0.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are asked for the difference in the other direction, i.e., how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. This is given by J - R = 30 - 30 = 0.

However, we know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and we know that Robert has 30 cherries. Therefore, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. We can now find the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries: 60 - 30 - 20 = 10.

Now that we know J = 10 and R = 30, we can find the difference in the other direction: R - J = 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total earnings for the two days, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her 8-day vacation.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. Therefore, she will use a total of 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Now, we need to find out how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen she will need. To do this, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of $100, which is the price of the blue car. To do this, we multiply $100 by 0.4 (since 40% is equivalent to 0.4).

0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. We are given the following information:

1. E = 19 (Emil's current age)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad: 24 = 0.5D
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother: 24 = 2B

From equation 3, we can deduce that B = 24 / 2 = 12.

From equation 2, we can deduce that D = 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's current age is D - (24 - E) = 48 - 5 = 43. Emil's brother is currently B - (24 - E) = 12 - 5 = 7.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is D - (24 - E) + B - (24 - E) = 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads. 
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30 students. 
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

To find the number of cheerleaders or band members, we need to calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students. 
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. 
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant, plus its own width of 1 foot. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. The total space for each plant is 1.5 feet (18 inches) between the plants plus the width of the plant itself (12 inches), which equals 30 inches.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers. Each flower costs $6 at the store, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = 162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate half of 18.

Half of 18 is 18 divided by 2, which equals 9.

9 * 7 = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

Next, we'll find the cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have 30 pounds of soil in total. So, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we then multiply this amount by the number of months in a year to find the total savings: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling rate: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time.

We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This can be expressed as:

3 * (30) = x + 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's consider the checks for the electric and gas bills. Since he writes 1 check per month for each of these bills, the total number of checks for these bills is 1 + 1 = 2 checks per month. With 12 months in a year, the total number of checks for these bills is 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Next, we'll consider the checks to the church. Buford writes 2 checks per month to the church, so the total number of checks to the church per year is 2 * 12 = 24 checks.

Lastly, we'll consider the checks to the pest and lawn service. Since he writes 1 check every 3 months, the total number of checks to the pest and lawn service per year is 1 * 4 = 4 checks.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
24 (electric and gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights, but we also know that the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane. This means the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We are given that the total age of the children is 20, and the ages of Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4, respectively.

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20
Helene's age + W = 13

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
Helene's age + W = 13
7 + W + W = 13
2W = 6
W = 3

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to first determine the total number of cookies given to the church. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. To find 1/2 of 1500, we can multiply 1500 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 1500 by 2. 

1500 / 2 = 750

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's consider the ratio of the watermelon slices. 

Let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, the ratio of the watermelon slices is 2:1 (adult:child).

The total number of parts in the ratio is 2 + 1 = 3. The fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is 2/3.

To find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100: (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%.

However, since the question asks for the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to consider the total number of adults, which is 2. The total percentage of the watermelon the adults get is 2 * 66.67% = 133.34%. But this is the total percentage of the watermelon the adults get, not the percentage each adult gets.

To find the percentage each adult gets, we need to divide the total percentage by the number of adults: 133.34% / 2 = 66.67%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66.67}$"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total work hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 5:00 pm to minutes: 5:00 pm = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Now, subtract the total time required from the desired serving time in minutes:
300 minutes (5:00 pm) - 180 minutes (total time) = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes back to hours and minutes, we divide by 60:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake at 3:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

2. The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

3. The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64 (for Peter)
7x = 56 (for Martha)

To find the value of x, we can solve these equations. Let's start with Peter's equation:

4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:

For Peter: 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

Given the dimensions of the pool: length = 25 feet, width = 14 feet, and height (depth) = 4 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 7.48 (not 5.9, as 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons) to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 7.48
Gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 10472 * 0.10
Cost = 1047.2

The final answer is: $1047.20"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

There are 9 red sticks. 
Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance each person traveled, we multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. So, his distance is 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and he traveled for 10 hours. So, his distance is 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. This is calculated as 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can find the number of male students over 16 by dividing 1500 by 4, which equals 375. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students. Since one-half of these students are male, we can find the number of male students under 16 by dividing 1500 by 2, which equals 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which equals 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentage change and algebra. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 6%.

Solving for y, we get y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 34%.

Solving for x, we get x = 55%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2, which equals $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs given away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 0.3 packs. To do this, we multiply 0.3 by 60: 0.3 * 60 = 18.

Now, we add the number of pieces in 1 pack (60) to the number of pieces in 0.3 packs (18) to find the total number of pieces each friend received: 60 + 18 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120.

Year 1: 
The 5% increase is calculated as 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. The new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The 5% increase is calculated as 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The 5% increase is calculated as 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first determine the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only, so the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

However, we are given that 2 of the albums were portraits. This means the 3 remaining albums are portraits as well. So, the correct number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album + 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits + 27 portraits = 45 portraits.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 45 portraits = 72.

However, the question asks for portraits and selfies, not the total. The question is asking for the number of portraits and selfies, not the total. The correct answer is portraits and selfies, not the total. The correct answer is portraits and selfies, which is 45 portraits and 27 selfies."
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we need to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation 4x + 12y = 120, we get 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The family's daily sandwich consumption is the sum of the individual daily consumption of each family member. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

To find the total number of sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 11 * 7 = 77.

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate their daily ore production and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

First, let's determine the daily ore production of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. 

Now, to find out how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe, we need to calculate 50% more than the iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day by multiplying 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price ratio between the first two packages. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.

We can simplify the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4, which simplifies to 3/2.

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price of the second package by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

First, let's consider the red balloons. 40% of them burst, so we need to find 40% of 25. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. This means 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, we consider the yellow balloons. Half of them were released, so we need to find 1/2 of 12. This is the same as multiplying 12 by 0.5, which equals 6. Therefore, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. This means Sally added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, we can find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by adding the remaining red, green, yellow, and blue balloons: 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, the probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, which is not possible. This is because probabilities cannot be greater than 100%. 

To find the correct probability, we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get -2%. However, we cannot have a negative probability. 

To find the correct probability, we need to add 100% to -2% to get 98%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seats in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question implies that the remaining tickets are for guests.

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This means he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find the number of small beans. Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150.

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and his new annual income after college.

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000. Additionally, he lost $100,000 in income by not working while in college. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

First, let's find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

Next, let's find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken salad: 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pasta salad: 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the two costs together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

1. The amount lost in the first race is -$5.
2. In the second race, the amount won is 2 times the amount lost in the first race, plus $1. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, the amount lost is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.
4. Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.
5. The number of races is 3.
6. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) + 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the price of a car after a certain number of years, given its initial price and an annual depreciation rate. This is a classic example of exponential decay.

The formula for exponential decay is given by:

A(t) = A0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
- A(t) is the amount after time t
- A0 is the initial amount
- r is the decay rate (in decimal form)
- t is the time

In this case, the initial price of the car (A0) is $20,000, the decay rate (r) is 21% or 0.21, and we want to find the price after 3 years (t = 3).

Plugging in the values, we get:

A(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= 20000 * (0.79)^3
= 20000 * 0.4914
= 9828

"To find the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate her daily water consumption in gallons and then multiply it by the number of days.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert her daily water consumption to gallons by dividing 8 cups by 16 cups/gallon. 

8 cups/day ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day

Now, we multiply her daily water consumption in gallons by the number of days to find the total amount of water she drinks in 30 days.

0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons

"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

The area of a single tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, so its area is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can find the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of James' insurance, we first need to calculate 60% of the normal cost. This can be done by multiplying the normal cost by 0.6.

Normal cost: $120
Increased cost = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add the increased cost to the normal cost to get the total cost.

Total cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to get the annual cost.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as 'J'. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Becky ate J + 3 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2J slices.

We know that each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, making a total of 8 * 4 = 32 slices.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices. Therefore, we can set up the equation J + 3 = 10 to find the number of slices Jake ate. Solving for J, we get J = 7.

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find the number of slices Silvia ate, which is 2J = 2 * 7 = 14.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the charges for the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200. 

The cost of the 30-minute visit is $300/hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the amount of money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to determine the amount of money they each had initially and then calculate the remaining amount after they spent their respective portions.

Let's assume the initial amount of money they each had is x. Since they each had $60, we can set up the equation x = 60.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money they each spent:

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * x. This means she has 3/4 * x left. Since she had $60, we can set up the equation 3/4 * x = 60.

Solving for x, we get x = 60 / (3/4) = 60 * (4/3) = 80.

So, Maggie initially had $80 and Riza initially had $80.

Maggie spent 1/4 * $80 = $20, leaving her with $80 - $20 = $60.

Riza spent 1/3 * $80 = $26.67, leaving her with $80 - $26.67 = $53.33.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $60 + $53.33 = $113.33.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now we know that the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"Let's denote Binkie's score as B and Frankie's score as F. We are given that F = 2B + 15 and B = 90.

We can substitute the value of B into the equation for F:

F = 2(90) + 15

Using the order of operations, we first multiply 2 by 90:

F = 180 + 15

Next, we add 15 to 180:

F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

"To find the total time James spent walking, we need to consider the round trip. Since he walked to the store and then back home, the total distance covered is twice the distance to the store. Given that the store is 4 miles from his home, the total distance is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / rate. In this case, the distance is 8 miles and the rate is 4 miles per hour. Plugging in the values, we get time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Now, let's find the amount of money Jenny saved: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"To find the total minutes John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes for the regular classes and the extra classes, then add the minutes for the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes for the regular classes: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

Next, let's find the total minutes for the extra classes: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1/16 of the total minutes per week is spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total minutes per week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what the velociraptors had. This means the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we need to find out how much meat was left after the T-Rex ate its share. Since the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

However, we are not done yet. We need to find the original weight of the triceratops. Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must be twice the amount the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 out of 12 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken. She then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, resulting in 3 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 2 shaken and 5 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 2 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (2 / 7) * 100
Probability = 28.57%

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to determine the number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step using algebra.

Let M represent Martha's age, J represent Jeff's age, and K represent Mike's age.

We are given the following information:
1. J = M + 10 (Jeff is 10 years older than Martha)
2. M = K - 4 (Martha is 4 years younger than Mike)
3. K = 24 (Mike is 24 years old)

We can substitute the value of K into equation 2 to find M.
M = K - 4
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now that we have Martha's age, we can substitute the value of M into equation 1 to find J.
J = M + 10
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels. They were on sale for 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the initial charge after the return. The initial charge was $85.00, and she returned an item worth $15.00, so the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to consider the information given about the jellyfish that change color under UV light.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can express the number of large jellyfish that change color as (1/5)x * (1/3) = (1/15)x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation (1/15)x = 6 to represent this relationship.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to isolate x:
(1/15)x * 15 = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to save. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Considering she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Given that Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary, her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take her to save the required amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, we divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

First, we calculate the one-way distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time
Given that the speed is 70 miles per hour and the time is 2 hours, we can plug in the values:
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

However, we need to consider that John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance per month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

Now, considering John visits his parents twice a month, we need to account for the frequency of his visits. Since he visits twice a month, we can simply multiply the total distance by 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To find the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine the total distance Sofie will walk in that time frame. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Now, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. To find Brian's distance, we divide Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we first need to determine the total number of toys produced by the four workers in 10 hours. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
Two other workers produce 4 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
The combined production rate of these four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 
In 10 hours, they produce a total of 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys in 10 hours. 
To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find one-fourth of 60, we divide 60 by 4, which equals 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find half of 60, we divide 60 by 2, which equals 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received x/2 stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris received (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This implies that Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
4. Since Kris received x/4 stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation x/4 = 16 to find the initial number of stickers Seth had.

Solving for x, we get:
x/4 = 16
x = 16 * 4
x = 64

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. 

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's in ounces: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce contains 30 M&M's, we multiply the total weight in ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to establish the relationship between the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can express the speed of the 2nd fastest car as 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the correct answer is 750 miles per hour."
"Let's denote Liam's current age as L and Vince's current age as V. We are given that L = 16.

Two years ago, Liam's age was L - 2, and Vince's age was V - 2. According to the problem, L - 2 = 2(V - 2).

We can now solve for V:

L - 2 = 2V - 4
16 - 2 = 2V - 4
14 = 2V - 4
14 + 4 = 2V
18 = 2V
V = 18 / 2
V = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

We also know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

Substituting the second equation into the first one gives S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes from cutting down the tree, we first need to determine the total length of the usable tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable length by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then add them up.

Valerie's brother earns twice as much as Valerie, and since Valerie earns $5000 per month, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's assume the speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. 

The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40. 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. Since she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, the total amount saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Next, we find the remaining amount she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find the number of additional weeks:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we'll find the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we'll add the number of blue birds in the tree with 3 blue birds: 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's solve the problem using algebra.

Let x be the number of marbles Bob has initially. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. Therefore, we can write the equation as x + 24 = 84.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24.

x = 60

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles initially, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

Therefore, the correct answer is 50."
"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the equation (33 + x) / 2 * 5 = 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 = 40

Since the temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33, and 4 ounces of it are poured into the bottle, the remaining temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 - 4 * (33 / 8) = 33 - 16.5 = 16.5 degrees. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the remaining 33-degree mug and the second bottle, multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (16.5 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (16.5 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (16.5 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(16.5 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(16.5 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(16.5 + x) * 5 >= 80
82.5 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 82.5
5x >= -2.5
x >= -2.5 / 5
x >= -0.5

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the equation again. 

Since the temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33, and 4 ounces of it are poured into the bottle, the remaining temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 - "
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the number of cows added in three weeks is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows is 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Therefore, the total number of chickens is 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Now, we can find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the total number of cows and chickens together: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

First, let's find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, we multiply this by 4.
Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Next, we need to find 10% of $40.00 to calculate the discount.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted cost.
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total number of bagels is:
Total number of bagels = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate as S and the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop as P.

We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be expressed as:

P = 6 - 3 = 3 (for 2 scoops)

Now, we need to find the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop. Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3/2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop.

Now, we are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be expressed as:

S = 23 - 5
S = 18

Since it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

Total potatoes = S * 1.5
Total potatoes = 18 * 1.5
Total potatoes = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first determine the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Next, we add the number of green jellybeans to the number of red jellybeans to find the total number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Now, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of women in the ratio is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply the fraction of women by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers separately.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sunflowers as S. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day, we can set up the equation:

2S = 26

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

S = 13

Now, let's find the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, and Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day, we can set up the equation:

12B = 56

Dividing both sides by 12, we get:

B = 4.67 (round down to 4 since we can't sell a fraction of a bouquet)

However, since we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can also express the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets as 12B. 

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and bouquets:

Total sunflowers/day = S + 12B
Total sunflowers/day = 13 + 12(4)
Total sunflowers/day = 13 + 48
Total sunflowers/day = 61

Since we want to find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

Total sunflowers = 61 * 3
Total sunflowers = 183

The final answer is: 183"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100 investment. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, we need to find out how many rocks Adam sells. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we multiply the total number of rocks by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Now, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find out how much money Adam loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

First, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene:

1. For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
2. For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
3. For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Now, let's compare these values to find the maximum:

- 9 days (large-sized)
- 6 days (medium-sized)
- 7 days (small-sized)

The maximum value is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"

"When considering the probability of two independent events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event. 

In this case, the first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which translates to a probability of 0.2. The second ticket, being three times more likely to win, has a probability of 0.2 * 3 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply these probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

Expressing this as a percentage, we get 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2R.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be expressed as the equation: 2R + 5 = 27.

To solve for R, we need to isolate the variable. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 2R = 22.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for R: R = 11.

We know that Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2R = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.

The total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they are divided equally among themselves, we divide the total number of seashells by 3: 60 / 3 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to determine the length of the second song. Since it's 60% longer than the first song, we calculate 60% of the first song's length, which is 5 minutes. 

60% as a decimal is 0.6, so we multiply 5 by 0.6 to find the additional length of the second song.

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

The second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find its total length, we add 3 minutes to the first song's length.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now that we have the lengths of both songs, we add them together to find the total time of the cassette.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now that we know Carl's height, we can find the length of his cane, which is half of his height.
Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 100 by 20, which equals 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by 2300, resulting in 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

However, Hortex can only produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of those wearing purple bows.

Let's start by finding the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 of the 8 babies are wearing purple, which is 6 babies.

Next, we find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 of the 6 babies wearing purple are also wearing bows, which is 2 babies.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know that 1/4 of the 8 babies are wearing blue, and 1/3 of the 6 babies wearing purple are also wearing bows. This means the remaining 2/3 of the purple babies are not wearing bows. So, the number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2, and the number of babies wearing purple but not bows is 4. Therefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 4 = 6.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 * (1/4) = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find the total number of eggs found by each person, we need to follow the given information:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to determine the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined size. 

To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which equals 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments for the third complex.

Now, we add the sizes of all three complexes: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

Let's start with the given information:

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as 'R' and the amount of money Rissa was given as '3R' since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. 

We are given that Ronnie was given $5, so R = $5.

Now, let's denote the amount of money given to their little sister as 'x'. After giving 'x' to their little sister, Ronnie is left with R - x and Rissa is left with 3R - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (3R - x) = (4/5) * 3R.

We can simplify the equation: 
(3R - x) = (12/5)R
3R - x = (12/5)R
- x = (12/5)R - 3R
- x = (12R - 15R)/5
- x = (-3R)/5
x = (3R)/5

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: R - x = $5 - (3/5) * $5 = $5 - $3 = $2.

"To find the amount of red paint used in the mural, let's break down the information given.

We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the total amount of paint used as 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can denote the amount of each as x. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can observe a geometric progression in the number of clouds each day. The sequence starts with 3 clouds on Monday and doubles each day.

The sequence of clouds is: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

We can calculate the total number of clouds by adding these numbers together. To simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

where S is the sum, a is the first term (3), r is the common ratio (2), and n is the number of terms (5).

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = 3 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1)
S = 3 * (32 - 1) / 1
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100, we calculate the additional pods as 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final numerical answer is: $300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as A1 and the number of goals scored by team B in the first half as B1. We know that team A scores 4 goals in the first half, so A1 = 4.

We are also given that team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so B1 = A1 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * B1 = 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is A1 + (1/4 * 4 * B1) = 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is B1 + 4 * B1 = 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To determine how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the remaining chalk after Monday and then find out how many days it will last at a rate of 20% per day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. To find the remaining chalk, we calculate 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last at a rate of 20% per day. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Let's set up an equation to find the number of days 'x':

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the number of face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine the number of face masks Mike bought. Since we know that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we can represent the number of face masks Mike bought as 'x'. 

The number of face masks Johnny bought can then be represented as 3x + 2.

Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can substitute x with 5 in the equation 3x + 2 to find the number of face masks Johnny bought.

3 * 5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then divide it by the total number of James' teeth.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we need to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist fixes (15) by the total number of James' teeth (30), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."
"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

First, we multiply the numerator (2) by the total gallons (4000), which gives us 8000. Then, we divide this product by the denominator (5) to find the result.

8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27000 / $500
Total books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.

Next, he put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples.

To find the total number of apples he picked up, we add the 6 apples from the previous step to the 6 new apples: 6 + 6 = 12.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to calculate the miles he ran on each set of days and then add them together.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 to get the total miles for these days: 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam also ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 to get the total miles for these days: 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. This means his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, we are also given that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we can express this as 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as (5/15). Now, we can subtract: (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Let's denote the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs as 't' minutes. We can set up the equation based on the net rate of snowballs: (1/5)t = 60. To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by 5: t = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"Let's denote John's age 20 years ago as J. Since John is currently 28, we can express this as J + 20 = 28. Solving for J, we get J = 8.

Now, we know that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as M. This can be expressed as J = 2M. Substituting J = 8, we get 8 = 2M, which simplifies to M = 4.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to M: M + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had left after the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had left after the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had left after the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"To find the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"

"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is calculated by dividing 120 by 8, which is a straightforward division problem. 

120 ÷ 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

"To find the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then determine the actual number of jelly beans it can hold. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.

First, let's calculate the volume of the jar:

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Volume of one jelly bean = 0.15 cubic inches
Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has a capacity of 200 people and currently has 180 people on it. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

The initial cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the new cost of one visit after a 150% increase. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he requires to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the total pounds of meat needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find the total seasoning needed by multiplying the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10
Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, leaving x - 6 grapes.

Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. So, after her brother used the grapes, the remaining number of grapes is x - 6 - 30 = x - 36.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - 36 - 48 = 0, since the mother used all the remaining grapes.

Simplifying the equation, we get x - 84 = 0.

Adding 84 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 84.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to calculate the number of teachers who were not sick and then add the number of substitute teachers.

First, we subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers to find the number of teachers who were not sick.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers sick = 13
Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find the total number of teachers at school.

Number of substitute teachers = 9
Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out her total required score. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, we can set up the equation:

Total questions correct = 0.7 * Total questions
Total questions correct = 0.7 * 110
Total questions correct = 77

Since she got 60% of the first test's questions right, we can find out how many she got right on the first test:
60% of 70 questions = 0.6 * 70
60% of 70 questions = 42

Now, we can find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test by subtracting the questions she got right on the first test from her total required score:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write the equation B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116, which gives us the equation S + B = 116.

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of chips each family member gets, we first need to calculate the total number of chips. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips in each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets. There are 5 family members, so we divide 110 by 5.

110 / 5 = 22

Therefore, each family member gets 22 chips."
"To calculate the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to consider the time for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice that long, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. We are given that there are 20 helmets. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can calculate the number of robots by dividing the number of helmets by 2: 20 / 2 = 10 robots.

Next, we are told that there are half as many helmets as footballs. This means the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. To find the number of footballs, we multiply the number of helmets by 2: 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Now that we have the number of robots, helmets, and footballs, we can find the total number of items by adding them together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40

"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we need to convert the new speed from words per minute to words per hour, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. 

375 WPM = 375 words/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 22,500 words/hour

Now, we can find the time it takes to speak 4500 words.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 22,500 words/hour = 0.2 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60.

Time = 0.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people. 
On the second day, he saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To find the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make. He wants to make 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, which is twice as tart.

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons.

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice, so we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for this gallon.

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade and the regular lemonade.

Lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 5 cups - 2 cups = 3 cups
Lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 3 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 3/6 * 6 = 3 lemons

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 3 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 5 lemons

"To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Total number of legs = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Total pairs of legs = 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

"Let's denote the number of blue blocks as B, the number of yellow blocks as Y, and the number of red blocks as R. We are given that B = 4 and Y = 2B.

We are also given that the total number of blocks is 32, so we can write the equation B + Y + R = 32.

Substituting Y = 2B into the equation, we get B + 2B + R = 32, which simplifies to 3B + R = 32.

Since B = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 3(4) + R = 32, which simplifies to 12 + R = 32.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get R = 20.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which is equivalent to 0.3 as a decimal. So, the depreciation in the first year is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. The value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, which is also equivalent to 0.3 as a decimal. So, the depreciation in the second year is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. The value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which is equivalent to 0.2 as a decimal. So, the depreciation in the third year is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. The value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

To find 1% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.01. 

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

"To find the number of pens Sarah has, we first need to determine the number of pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3 to find the number of pens Timothy has: 18 * 3 = 54.

Next, we need to find the number of pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2: 54 / 2 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote Jackie's height before summer as J. We are given that Albert's height is 36 inches, and Anne's height is twice that of Albert, so Anne's height is 2 * 36 = 72 inches.

We also know that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we can express this as an equation: J + 3 = 72 - 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get J + 3 = 70.

To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to isolate J. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get J = 70 - 3.

J = 67.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To find the total money the company receives, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, we find the number of bars produced in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

Next, we find the number of bars produced in two weeks. Since there are 2 weeks, the company produces 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

Now, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar, which is $2. So, the total money the company receives is 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we need to calculate the cost of one T-shirt at the original price and the other at 50% off. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. His total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought 4 cones at $1.25 each, so the total cost is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine Josh's earnings, we first need to calculate the number of days he is open in a two-week period. Since Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, he is open 5 days a week.

In a two-week period, there are 14 days. Since Josh is open 5 days a week, he is open 14 / 7 * 5 = 10 days in two weeks.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cars Josh services in two weeks. He services 3 cars per day, so in 10 days, he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in two weeks are 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the current number of cookies Randy has, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then adjust for the cookies he ate or gave away, and add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
So, he ate 3 cookies in total.

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he baked 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies initially = 18
Cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7
Cookies baked = 12

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes Nate to fill them in.

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes per day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. 

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, the dog also digs 6 new holes every night. Since Nate is on vacation for 14 days, the dog digs 6 * 14 = 84 new holes at night.

Total holes = 84 (daytime holes) + 84 (nighttime holes) = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"

"Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P. We are given the following information:

1. T = 16
2. T = 2 + P
3. B = 7
4. T + B + P = 29

From equation 2, we can express P in terms of T: P = T - 2. Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

T + B + (T - 2) = 29

Substituting T = 16 and B = 7 into the equation, we get:

16 + 7 + (16 - 2) = 29

Combine like terms:

37 = 29

This is a contradiction, so the initial assumption that T = 16 is incorrect. However, we can use the fact that T = 2 + P to find the correct value of T. Rearranging the equation, we get:

T - 2 = P

Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

T + B + (T - 2) = 29

Substituting B = 7, we get:

T + 7 + T - 2 = 29

Combine like terms:

2T + 5 = 29

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2T = 24

Divide both sides by 2:

T = 12

Now that we have the correct value of T, we can find the value of P:

P = T - 2
= 12 - 2
= 10

Now, we can find the number of beakers lost:

Total beakers = 7
Beakers on the lab bench = Total beakers - Beakers lost
29 - (Total beakers) = Beakers lost
29 - 7 = Beakers lost
22 = Beakers lost

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

Now, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's analyze the given information:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as x minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2x minutes.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

However, the question asks for the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race, which is 4 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we must first calculate the required line for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

Now, we need to subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount required: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's find the daily revenue. They order 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total daily revenue is 2 * $5 + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open, which is 2 days a week. Therefore, the weekly revenue is $15 * 2 = $30.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first determine the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

Given that the profit percentage is 25%, the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

"Let's denote John's current age as J, James' current age as Jj, and the current age of John's youngest son as Js. We are given that Jj = 2 * (Dora's current age) and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.

Dora's current age = 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, Jj = 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We are also given that John had James when he was 19, so J - Jj = 19. However, this equation is inconsistent with the information that James is 18 years old. 

However, if we ignore this inconsistency, we can find the current age of John's youngest son. We are given that John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so Js = 32.

In 3 years, Js will be Js + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour, we need to calculate their individual rates of peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes. To find out how many oranges she can peel in 60 minutes, we need to convert 60 minutes to the same unit as her rate. Since her rate is in minutes, we can directly divide 60 minutes by 3 minutes per orange to get the number of oranges she can peel in an hour.

60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges she can peel in 60 minutes, we need to convert 60 minutes to the same unit as her rate. Since her rate is in minutes, we can directly divide 60 minutes by 4 minutes per orange to get the number of oranges she can peel in an hour.

60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we can find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane by subtracting the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number of oranges peeled by Ana.

20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and the discount is 80% off. 

To find the discount amount, multiply the original cost by the discount percentage: 400 * 0.8 = $320. 
The cost of the radiator after the discount is the original cost minus the discount amount: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can express this as an equation: C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can express the total number of legs as 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
