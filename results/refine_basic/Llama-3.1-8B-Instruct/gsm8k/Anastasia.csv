"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and for her baking, she uses 4 eggs. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To make a robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. It takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since the amount of white fiber needed is half that of the blue fiber, we calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Josh's house-flipping adventure. He initially buys a house for $80,000 and then invests $50,000 in repairs. This significant renovation increases the house's value by a whopping 150%.

To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original price. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. Adding this to the original price gives us a new value of $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the house, which is the sum of the original price and the repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"Let's break down James' running routine. He decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters long. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, let's find the total meters he runs in one session. Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Now, let's find the total meters he runs in a week. Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens. To find out the total number of cups of feed needed per meal, we multiply the number of chickens by the number of cups of feed per chicken: 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, we need to find out how many cups of feed she has given them in total so far. We add the morning and afternoon feed: 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help Kylar with his shopping. To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time.

Let's find the pattern of the cost of each glass: 
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
- The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.0839856.
- The tenth glass costs $0.0839856 * 0.6 = $0.05039136.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.05039136 * 0.6 = $0.030234816.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.030234816 * 0.6 = $0.0181407896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.0181407896 * 0.6 = $0.01088447476.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.01088447476 * 0.6 = $0.006530684856.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.006530684856 * 0.6 = $0.0039184109136.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.0039184109136 * 0.6 = $0.0023610469456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447476 + $0.006530684856 + $0.0039184109136 + $0.0023610469456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. Carla has to install updates for 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down John's trip into segments to find out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's consider the return trip. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so the distance traveled during this time is 0 miles. Then, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

The total distance traveled in the return trip is 15 + 160 = 175 miles.

Now, let's add the distance traveled in the first 3 hours to the distance traveled in the return trip to find the total distance:

Total distance = 180 + 175
Total distance = 355 miles

However, we need to find the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours. Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles."
"Let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week. She earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works. To find her earnings for these hours, we multiply 40 by $10, which equals $400.

For the overtime hours, Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, let's calculate the downloads for the third month. The downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 0.3 by 180, which equals 54. 

So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought. 

First, we need to find the cost of 3 dozen donuts. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 donuts. The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 36 * $68 = $2448 / 36 = $68 * 3 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes. 2 dozen is 2 * 12 = 24 cupcakes. The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 24 * $80 = $1920 / 24 = $80 * 2 = $160.

Then, we find the cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen is 6 * 12 = 72 cheesecakes. The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 72 * $55 = $3960 / 72 = $55 * 6 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the lemon tree costs $90 to plant, and each year it will grow 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each. The annual maintenance cost is $3.

First, we need to calculate the revenue generated by the tree each year. Since the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5, the total revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year.

However, we also need to consider the annual maintenance cost of $3. So, the net revenue each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, let's find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

Since the tree starts generating revenue in the first year, it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to find out how many she started with.

Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". 

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

2. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

3. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2/3)x - 2 is (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = (1/3)x - 1.

4. So, she had ((2/3)x - 2) - ((1/3)x - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, which simplifies to (1/3)x - 1.

5. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (1/3)x - 1 = 5.

6. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)x = 6.

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a dance class with 20 students. First, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance. To find out how many students that is, we multiply 20 by 0.2.

20 * 0.2 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find out how many are left.

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. To find out how many students that is, we multiply 16 by 0.25.

16 * 0.25 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance.

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best purchase option for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the increase in value for the $5,000 jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the increase in value for the $8,000 electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry is expected to increase in value by $125, which is more than the $96 increase for the electronic gadgets, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in the same direction for the first day, covering 80 miles. The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider the two legs of their journey. Since they travel in two different directions, we can't simply add the distances. Instead, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this case, the two sides are the 80 miles traveled westward and the 150 miles traveled northward. We can use these values to find the total distance covered by each train.

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"Let's break down Jill's annual salary. 

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked to get the total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, we calculate her earnings from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked to get the total hours worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"Let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks. 

First, we need to find out how many days are in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of days: 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Now, we know Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. To find out how many eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down Marissa's hike. She's already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, so she's covered a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. To find the total time she needs to complete the 12-mile hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, let's find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the remaining amount of water, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water. The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Since we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks. 

Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. This means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to calculate the difference between Raymond's current age and the age when he had a son.

The difference between Raymond's current age (25) and the age when he had a son (23) is 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the sales for Billy on Tuesday. He had 8 customers, and we need to find out how many DVDs he sold.

The first 3 customers bought one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"Let's calculate how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The candle burns for 4 hours, and it melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour. To find the total melting, we multiply the rate by the time.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"Let's solve this problem together. We know that Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50, and this is with a 25% discount from the original price. To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. We need to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, given that each box costs $8.50 and she paid a total of $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. The cost of the chicken meal is $12. The cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15. The cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add these costs together: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. This is the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pizza boxes. Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from this amount: $50 - $33 = $17.

Now that we know the total cost of the pizza boxes is $17, we can find the number of boxes by dividing this amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items. 

First, we need to find the cost of each item. One pair of shorts costs $16.50, so 3 pairs of shorts will be 3 x $16.50 = $49.50. 
Next, one pair of pants costs $22.50, so 3 pairs of pants will be 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
Lastly, one pair of shoes costs $42, so 3 pairs of shoes will be 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"Let's break down Cynthia's ice cream expenses. She eats one serving of ice cream every night, and she buys cartons with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.

To find out how much she'll spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys. Since she eats one serving per night for 60 nights, we divide 60 by 15 to find the total number of cartons:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream. Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"Let's break down Henry's bike trip. He made two stops during his 60-mile journey. The first stop was after 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points. Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

The final answer is: 15"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm happy to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much as the first one.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can calculate its cost as 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is the sum of their individual costs, which is 33 + 66. We know that this total is $5 less than the cost of the boots. So, we can write the equation as B = 33 + 66 - 5, where B is the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

So, the boots cost $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"Let's break down the guesses. The first person thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second person thinks there are 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person thinks there are 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people. The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time he spends on them each day and then multiply that by 7.

First, let's find the total time John spends on his dogs daily. He has 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We can set up two equations based on the given information. The first equation is G = S + 30, which represents the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. The second equation is S + G = 110, which represents the total number of coins.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given about the jewels. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number.

Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. 
Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total.

Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down Mike's ping pong game. He played for 40 minutes, which is divided into two 20-minute segments. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

Now, let's calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's calculate how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John sells his 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

John also has $5 left, which means he spent 195 - 5 = 190 dollars on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35, which is the amount he used from his own money. 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down John's running schedule. He runs 60 miles a week, which is spread across 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. For the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

To find the total running time, we add up the hours from each day: 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours. Since John runs 3 days a week, we multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"Let's break down Dana's speeds. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. That gives us 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time she spends walking and running. We're told she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Over six hours, she spends 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking and 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running.

To find the distance she travels while walking, we multiply her walking speed by the time she spends walking: 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. To find the distance she travels while running, we multiply her running speed by the time she spends running: 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's analyze the situation. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4.

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"The great dragon, Perg, sits atop mount Farbo, breathing fire that reaches a distance of 1000 feet. Polly, a brave warrior, possesses a gold javelin that can slay the dragon. However, the javelin can only be thrown 400 feet when Polly doesn't hold the sapphire gemstone. But when she does hold the gemstone, her throwing distance triples.

To find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the new throwing distance with the gemstone. 

New throwing distance = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Let's solve this problem together. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Now, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To determine how many grams of chips you can still eat, we first need to find out how many calories you can consume. Since your daily calorie target is 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Now, let's find out how many servings of chips you can have with the remaining calories. Each serving of chips has 250 calories, so divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's calculate Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles.

First, we need to find out how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of the beeswax is $20.00.

Next, we need to find out how much money Charlie makes from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is $40.00.

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the total number of articles she wrote and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours). The total number of articles written in 3 days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total hours spent writing articles: 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine the total number of post-it notes she had after purchasing the package. We can do this by adding the initial post-it notes and the ones she purchased, then subtracting the ones she used.

Let's call the number of post-it notes in the package 'x'. The total number of post-it notes after purchasing the package is 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

Since the total post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial post-it notes, the post-it notes used, and the post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"Let's solve this problem together. To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece, which is 6 inches.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

"Let's calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week. 

First, we need to find out how many eggs are produced per week. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, the total number of eggs produced per week is:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"Let's break down Tom's journey. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance covered during this time is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. It's simply 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

For the return journey, the distance remains the same, 30 miles. However, his ship's speed is now 6 mph. To find the time taken for the return journey, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (one way) + 5 hours (return journey) = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. The remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. So, we divide 7.5 by 0.5 to get the number of toys: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, let's compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

"Let's break down the information given. We have a basket with 25 oranges in total. Out of these, 1 is bad, and 20% are unripe. We also know that 2 oranges are sour.

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 oranges is calculated as (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Since we know that 2 oranges are sour, we can add these to the number of oranges that are not good to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
6 (not good) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges are good.

"Let's calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes.

First, we need to find the total amount from the brownies. Since each brownie costs $3, we multiply the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per brownie ($3). This gives us 43 * $3 = $129.

Next, we calculate the total amount from the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake costs $4, so we multiply the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per cheesecake ($4). This gives us 23 * $4 = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each, and she's paying for them over a 3-month installment period with a 2% interest charged for each unit.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cell phones. Since there are 5 units, we multiply the price of one unit by 5: 5 * $150 = $750.

Next, we calculate the interest charged for each unit. The interest is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

Now, we find the total interest charged for 5 units: 5 * $3 = $15.

To get the total cost of the cell phones, we add the original price and the interest: $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment: $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from his flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. The prices for these flowers are $2.74 per pot for marigolds, $1.87 per pot for petunias, and $2.12 per pot for begonias.

To make things easier, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar. Marigolds will be $3 per pot, petunias will be $2 per pot, and begonias will be $2 per pot.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower. He sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias.

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, Luke is building a sandcastle with four levels, and each level has half the square footage of the one below it. The top level has a square footage of 16. Let's break it down:

The top level has 16 square feet.
The second level has half of that, which is 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.
The third level has half of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.
The fourth level has half of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet.

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

Next, we need to find out how much dog food the puppy will eat for the rest of the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food for 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

Now, we can find the total amount of dog food eaten in the first year by adding the amount eaten in the first 180 days and the amount eaten in the rest of the year. The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food eaten by the number of cups in one bag. The total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find 30% of $100. To do this, we multiply $100 by 0.3 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3).

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. To find out how much water they got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters.

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, let's consider the boy. He got 6 liters of water.

To find out how much water was taken in total, we add the water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds. To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result.

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that result to find Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"Let's count the thorns on Dan's rose bushes. He has 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's call the number of games they lost ""L"" and the number of games they won ""W"".

We can set up two equations based on this information. The first equation is W = L + 8, which represents the fact that they won 8 more games than they lost. The second equation is W + L = 22, which represents the total number of games played.

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get (L + 8) + L = 22. Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us L = 7.

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

So, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's calculate the total number of quilt blocks Gene has. To do this, we need to find out how many years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The alarm rings three times a day, and we need to find the total number of times it rang.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. 

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Christina invited 16 friends to her birthday party. However, 1/4 of the guests won't be attending, so we need to find out how many guests will actually show up.

To do this, we'll calculate 1/4 of 16, which is 4. Then, we'll subtract that from the total number of guests.

16 - 4 = 12

Now, we know that Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags needed, we'll multiply the number of guests by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Each gift bag costs $2, so we'll multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * $2 = $18

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags for her party."
"Let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic. 

First, we need to find out how much the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the children will eat. Since there are 5 children and each child eats half as much as an adult, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed. 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given:

Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. It's also mentioned that Lee runs two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles. 

To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time. So, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, we're told that Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. To find the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles after his diet change, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"

Now, we know there are 120 girls in the class. We're told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

2/3 * 120 = 80

So, 80 girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's calculate how many hours James slept. To do that, we need to find 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be double the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can find out how many cans Freda used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given: there are 30 cars originally on the motorway, and 5 of them take an exit. This means that 25 cars drive through the traffic jam. We also know that 20 cars drive through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"Hello there. I'm Anastasia, and I'm more than happy to help you with your gardening conundrum. Mary, the avid gardener, has received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her lovely country home. Feeling generous, she has decided to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family tomorrow.

To determine how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we multiply 2 by 40 to get the total number of potted plants she already has: 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery to her existing collection: 80 + 18 = 98.

Now, let's calculate how many potted plants she will give away. Since she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, she will give away a total of 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerome had 4 friends visiting him, and we need to find the total number of doorbell rings.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5, and then add it to 20. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"Let's calculate the total inner volume of the boxes. 

To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box and then multiply the resulting dimensions. 

The length of the box is 5 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the box is 6 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. That's 2 * 1 = 2 hours. 

On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes. On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. 

Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Now, let's find the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes. We know Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

"The baking competition is just around the corner, and Henry is in a frenzy. He's determined to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's start by assuming he baked x cookies last year. This year, he decides to make twice that amount, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, Henry's not as precise as he thought, and he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. This means he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies. As he's putting the cookies out to cool, he drops 5 of them, leaving him with a total of 110 cookies.

Now, let's set up an equation to solve for x. We know that 2x + 15 - 5 = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.

"Let's calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards. 

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the app company is offering a cashback of $0.20 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, we need to find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

First, let's calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Next, let's calculate the total cashback rewards:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

"Let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Julia's boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows back towards the shore. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows per second. To do this, we can divide the distance she rowed (20 feet) by the time it took her (16 seconds): 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's find out how many seconds it will take her to row the remaining distance to the shore. The total distance to the shore is 64 seconds away, but since we already know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the remaining distance by subtracting the initial 20 feet from the total distance: 64 seconds - 16 seconds = 48 seconds. 

However, we are actually interested in the time it takes to row the remaining distance in feet, not seconds. Since we know her rowing rate (1.25 feet/second), we can multiply this rate by the time it takes to row the remaining distance in seconds: 1.25 feet/second * 48 seconds = 60 feet.

Now, we know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, her boat takes on 2 liters of water. We can divide the total distance rowed (60 feet) by 10 to find the number of sets of 10 feet: 60 feet / 10 = 6 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 6 sets * 2 liters/set = 12 liters.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 teachers who share a whiteboard and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. Since each teacher uses the whiteboard in each lesson, we need to find the total number of lessons per day.

There are 4 teachers, and each has 2 lessons per day, so the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Now, we know the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's calculate the total number of flowers Ryan has in his garden. He plants 2 flowers a day, and we need to find out how many he has after 15 days, considering that 5 of them did not grow.

To do this, we first need to find out how many flowers he planted in total. Since he plants 2 flowers a day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers he plants each day: 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers.

However, we know that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers he actually has, we need to subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a certain price, and now she wants to sell it after the prices have gone up by 50%. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, we need to find the new price of the lumber after the 50% increase. To do this, we multiply the original price by 1.5. The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards to sell, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards to sell, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

The fraction of the total mixture that is sugar is 7/20. Now, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: (7/20) * 120 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the shoes for one child. Since each pair costs $60, the total cost for one child is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we multiply this by the number of children to get the total cost: $120 * 3 = $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port on the first day. To find the total number of vehicles on the first day, we multiply the number of containers by the number of vehicles in each container: 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we're told that the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles in each container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%. To find Adrien's new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first determine how many sheets he uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad: 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.

Next, we need to find out how many weeks are in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month: 60 * 4 = 240.

"Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week. 

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she had to complete some assignments, so she slept 2 hours less each day, which is 6 hours. 

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours

"Let's break down Rosie's running distance into two parts. First, she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find out how much time she has left to run. She has a total of 7 hours, and she's already run for 3 hours. So, the remaining time is:

Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

In the remaining time, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the remaining time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour to find the total distance:

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's dive into the problem. Jennie is helping at her mom's office, and she has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She decides to put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.

After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40. We're given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"The mystery of the spoons. Let's get to the bottom of it. Julia was preparing for a dinner party, and she needed some spoons. She bought a package, but then her husband came along and gave her another package of 5 spoons. Julia used 3 of the spoons while making the stew, but in the end, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's think about this logically. If Julia had a certain number of spoons initially, and then her husband gave her 5 more, and then she used 3, we can set up an equation to solve for the initial number of spoons. Let's call the initial number of spoons 'x'.

The equation would be: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

So, Julia must have bought a package of 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 82"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lily made 50 friends. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can find the number of friends Amy made by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each of them has.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Dillon will spend at the store.

First, we need to determine the cost of each item. We know that each pepper costs $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can calculate its price by multiplying the cost of a pepper by 3. So, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find out the cost of an orange. It's mentioned that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, which means an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item Dillon buys. He buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. He buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. Lastly, he buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue from patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue from patients. We multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then convert the average time per patient to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"The poor elves at Nissa's department store's Santa village. It's a chaotic scene, I must say. Let's break it down step by step.

First, a third of the 60 elves quit after those mischievous children vomit on them. To find out how many elves that is, we need to divide 60 by 3. That's 60 ÷ 3 = 20 elves who decided to leave.

Now, we're left with 60 - 20 = 40 elves. But, alas, it seems the remaining elves aren't out of the woods yet. Ten more elves quit after those rambunctious kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves, leaving us with 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"Let's break down Joseph's expenses for May and June. 

In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. To find the expenditure in June, we subtract $60 from $500.

Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we need to find the total expenditure for the two months. We add the expenditure in May and June.

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, we can find the total number of tickets used by multiplying the total number of rides by the cost per ride: 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"

"Let's figure out how many video games Bobby has. First, we need to find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"Let's solve this enchanting problem together. 

To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

(9 * 2) / 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"Let's break down Rory's delivery order. She orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in that time. However, he only completed 40 questions out of 75, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it. At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in that time. However, he only completed 30 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the information given. We know there are 700 bees in total, and the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, while the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2(2Q) = 4Q.

The total number of bees is the sum of the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens, which is 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q. We are given that this total is 700.

To find the number of queens, we can set up the equation 7Q = 700 and solve for Q. Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees, which is 2Q = 2(100) = 200. And the number of worker bees is 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

So, the number of worker bees is 400."
"Let's calculate how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

First, we need to find out how many hours he would work in a week. Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, we need to multiply the total hours by his hourly wage to find the total amount of money he would earn in a week. His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

"Let's break down the costs of John's purchases. 

First, we have the food items: milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. The total cost of these food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we have the non-food items: light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. The total cost of these non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.1 (which is the decimal form of 10%): 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Kim will make each week.

First, we need to determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients, and he's talking to 5 potential clients, so we can confidently include them in his calculations. This makes a total of 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.

Now, let's consider the bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and 15 of them returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees have not returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's consider the total number of bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and 60 more bees left in the last 6 hours. That makes a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees. However, we know that 15 bees had not returned yet from the first 6 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours. So, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket at the museum. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the adult ticket and the child ticket:
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier. 

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two racers, Steve and Tim, who are competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Time is equal to distance divided by speed.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shawnda's bike inflation service charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. 5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. Then, 3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. Finally, 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire. 

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of inflating these tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the cookies. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside. Each cookie costs $0.10.

First, we need to find the total number of cookies. We multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Now, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we need to find the change he receives. We subtract the total cost from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. 
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down Kimo's class schedule. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. That's a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week for these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. That's a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week for these days.

To find the total hours per week, we add the hours from both sets of days: 9 + 4 = 13 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks: 13 * 16 = 208 hours.

The final answer is: 208"
"Let's calculate the total length of the baked goods Bill bakes every day. 

First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good. Since each roll is 4 inches long, we multiply the number of rolls by the length of each roll: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, so we multiply the number of croissants by the length of each croissant: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

Now, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. Then, we multiply the number of baguettes by the length of each baguette: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Blake and Kelly are running on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly's runs. She runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's calculate the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies.

First, we need to find the cost of the pens. Since he bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.

Finally, we need to add the cost of the bond paper, which is $20.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the tank had a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, which is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"I'm Anastasia, and I'm here to help you with your question. Let's dive into the problem.

Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bag of marbles that initially costs $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months. We need to find the cost of the bag after 36 months.

To calculate the price increase, we'll multiply the current price by 20% (or 0.20) and add it to the current price. We'll repeat this process every two months for 18 periods (since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months each).

After 2 months, the price will be:
$20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $20 + $4 = $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
$24 + ($24 * 0.20) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
$28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

We'll continue this process for 18 periods, calculating the price every two months.

After 8 months, the price will be:
$34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20) = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

After 10 months, the price will be:
$41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20) = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

After 12 months, the price will be:
$49.7664 + ($49.7664 * 0.20) = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968

After 14 months, the price will be:
$59.71968 + ($59.71968 * 0.20) = $59.71968 + $11.943736 = $71.663416

After 16 months, the price will be:
$71.663416 + ($71.663416 * 0.20) = $71.663416 + $14.3326832 = $85.9960992

After 18 months, the price will be:
$85.9960992 + ($85.9960992 * 0.20) = $85.9960992 + $17.19921984 = $103.19531904

$103.19531904 + ($103.19531904 * 0.20) = $103.19531904 + $20.639063608 = $123.834382648

After 22 months, the price will be:
$123.834382648 + ($123.834382648 * 0.20) = $123.834382648 + $24.7668765296 = $148.6012591776

After 24 months, the price will be:

After 26 months, the price will be:
$178.32151101312 + ($178.32151101312 * 0.20) = $178.32151101312 + $35.664302202624 = $214.985813215744

After 28 months, the price will be:

"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour in missed income. To find out how much she'll lose, we multiply the number of hours by her hourly rate:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= $105

Now, let's consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the income she'll lose to the cost of hiring the accountant. Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's figure out how much money Jimmy has. We know that Ethel has $8. To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we know that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. So, we add 2 to 16: 16 + 2 = 18.

"I'm Anastasia, and I'm here to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. To find the total number of legs from the spiders, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs per spider: 80 * 8 = 640.

Next, we have 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. To find the total number of legs from the insects, we multiply the number of insects by the number of legs per insect: 90 * 6 = 540.

Lastly, we have 3 rare mutant invertebrates, and each has 10 legs. To find the total number of legs from the invertebrates, we multiply the number of invertebrates by the number of legs per invertebrate: 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add up the total number of legs from all three groups: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

"Let's solve the mystery of the bird ages. We have four birds: Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so we multiply Sally Four's age by 2 to find Granny Red's age: 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Now, let's find Sally Two's age. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so we add 3 to Granny Red's age: 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

"Let's break down Jessica's debt payments. She has three debts with minimum payments: student loans ($300/month), credit card ($200/month), and a mortgage ($500/month). However, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for each debt.

To calculate the increased minimum payments, we multiply each debt by 1.5:
- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"The task at hand is to determine how long it will take Billy to prepare the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue. He has 60 potatoes to peel and cut, and we know that it takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut one.

First, let's convert the time it takes to cut a potato into minutes, as it's easier to work with minutes for this calculation. 5 seconds is equivalent to 5/60 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes to peel all the potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the total time it takes to cut all the potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes.

To find the total time it takes to prepare all the potatoes, we add the time it takes to peel and cut them: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. Let's call the total cost 'x'. Then, the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + x

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
$25 + x = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

Now, let's solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25
$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know there are a total of 240 participants in the race. Out of these, 80 are Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we're told that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. His monthly salary is 6000 dollars, so the amount spent on rent is 1/4 * 6000 = 600 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. The amount spent on car fuel is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400 dollars.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 3400 is 1700, so he donates 1700 dollars to charity.

After the donation, the remaining amount is 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars.

Next, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars for their weekly expenses and household goods. The total amount given to his family is 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars.

The final answer is: $800"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can find Monic's number of crabs by subtracting 4 from Bo's total: 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Now, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. To find Rani's total, we add 10 to Monic's total: 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks of tutoring.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour. To find his earnings, we multiply the number of hours by his hourly rate:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour. We calculate his earnings for this week in the same way:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together to find his total earnings:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total number of students who voted in the class is 80, and the winner got 3/4 of the votes. To find the number of votes the winner got, we multiply 3/4 by 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60 votes

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is 80 - 60 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the information given. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team's first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's figure out how many apples Jenna and her mom picked. We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Her mom picked 20 apples, so to find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There's also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store.

First, let's calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Next, we know that the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 50 + 20 = 70.

We're told that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Since 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed to have a monthly interest rate of 2%. To find the total amount Mandy should pay after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the initial amount.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the bags. The cost of buying each bag is $20, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. So, the total cost for 'x' bags is $20x + $2x = $22x.

Next, we know that the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. This means the total revenue from selling the bags is the total cost plus the profit, which is $22x + $400.

Since the total revenue is also equal to the number of bags sold multiplied by the selling price, we can set up the equation:
$30x = $22x + $400

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtracting $22x from both sides of the equation gives us:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"Let's break down the costs of the outing. The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, which means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is a bit more straightforward – they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so that's a total of 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they're splitting the costs evenly, we need to divide the total by 3. So, $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"Let's calculate how many peaches John collects. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes John collects peaches. Since he collects for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the peaches per minute by the total minutes:

2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they require per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply this amount by the number of ducks in the flock.

Total pounds of insects per week = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 (the number of days in a week).

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, let's subtract the trees that die from the total: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the events step by step to find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's calculate how much change Violetta will get after buying the crayons. 

First, we need to find out how many crayons Violetta can buy. Since one crayon costs $2 and she has $20, we can divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can find the cost of a pen by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of a pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"Let's calculate how many pounds of carrots will not be used.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to be distributed to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

To find out how many pounds of carrots will be used, we multiply the number of restaurants by the pounds each restaurant receives: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

Now, we subtract the total pounds used from the initial amount to find out how many pounds will not be used: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

"Let's break down Elaine's Pokémon card collection. Initially, she had 20 cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100, and twice that is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"Let's break down John's situation. He wins an award with a $5000 monetary reward and a 5% raise in salary. His original weekly salary is $2000. 

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount he made that year:
Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"Let's calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre grape farm.

First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes are produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week. He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used a total of 7 * 2 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. That's 3 slices per omelet. So, for the 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

Lastly, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the total slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had initially, we add these two numbers together: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought. Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

"Let's break down Brinley's situation. She has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. To get an average of 93 on six tests, we need to find the total score she needs for the semester. We multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Now, let's add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"Let's break down Michael's bike riding into two periods. In the first period, he rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. 

To find the total distance covered in the first period, we multiply the number of kilometers, the number of times he rode, and the number of weeks: 25 kilometers * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks, covering a distance of 60 kilometers each time. To find the total distance covered in the second period, we multiply the number of kilometers, the number of times he rode, and the number of weeks: 60 kilometers * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Joe's bag of Halloween candy contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and we're given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

First, let's find the total weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Next, we'll find the total weight of the candied apples. With 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Finally, to find the total weight of the bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Let's break down Sara's situation. She wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each. That's a total of $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved up. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes."
"Let's solve this puzzle together. We have a flock of chickens, and we know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, while the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day.

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's call the number of red chickens R and the number of white chickens W. This means that W = R + 2.

Now, let's think about the total number of eggs. We can set up an equation based on the number of eggs each type of chicken produces:

3R (red chickens) + 5W (white chickens) = 42 (total eggs)

Since W = R + 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, and both of them are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. This means that the small pool lost 4 gallons and the big pool lost 4 gallons as well.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water four minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Lori's situation. She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a matching belt for $32.00. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she needs to pay a total of $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of $2000) = $2200.

Now, let's calculate how much she will pay in 12 months. She pays $165 per month, so in 12 months, she will pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she owes. So, the remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's count the flowers in the vase. There are 4 roses in the vase. We also know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we need to add 7 to the number of roses.

4 (roses) + 7 = 11 (dahlias)

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Harriet is 21 years old now, and we need to find the average age of Harriet, Zack, and Adrian in three years.

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. So, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Now, we know that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. To find Adrian's age, we multiply Harriet's age by 3. So, Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Naomi scored 68 points in the board game. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to calculate half of Naomi's points first. Half of 68 is 34. 

Now, we add 10 to that to find out Yuri's points: 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points: 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. We do this by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

To find the total time spent, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles together: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. To do this, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, we know that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining water by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The amount of rainwater collected is 60 liters. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's count the flowers Andy planted. He planted 90 geraniums. To find out how many petunias he planted, we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums. 

90 - 40 = 50

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. To find the total cost, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: 30 * 3 = $90.

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. To find the total cost, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: 18 * 5 = $90.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total: $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"Let's break down Andrew's road trip plan. He's traveling from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which takes 6 days. Now, if it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester, that would be 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Since Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to add the number of days for each leg of the trip. So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (by bus) + 3 (by car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down James' Pokémon card collection. He initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

First, we need to find the total number of cards he has. 
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

Now, James loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards. 
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 + 14 = 96

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we'll use the formula: 
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, so we multiply 120 by 0.3 to get the number of watermelons ready for harvest.

120 * 0.3 = 36 watermelons.

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after two months. We subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total number of watermelons.

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, so we multiply 84 by 0.75 to get the number of watermelons ready for harvest.

84 * 0.75 = 63 watermelons.

Finally, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the number of watermelons left after two months.

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"Let's break down the costs for Mark's fleet of cars.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Then, we need to add the registration fee for each car. Mark pays $1000 for each of the 12 cars, so the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, and he consumes 6 tomatoes per day. To find out how many tomatoes he eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. To find out how many tomatoes she eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7.

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week. We add the number of tomatoes Steve eats to the number his girlfriend eats.

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"Let's figure out how many pizzas John needs to order for his friends. 

First, we need to determine the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend should have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 * 4 = 80

Now, we need to find out how many pizzas are needed to get at least 80 slices. Since pizzas are sold in 8-slice portions, we'll divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza.

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

First, let's find out how many new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. To do this, we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5. This means he can make 5 new pens from the ink of the first 25 pens.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first 25 pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 empty pens) = 31 pens.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny has $90."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age. 

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age.

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their individual ages together.

Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall. We know that 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who left through exit A, we need to calculate 30% of 1000.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find the number of students remaining in the hall. This can be done by subtracting the number of students who left through exit A from the total number of students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Next, we are told that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who left through exit B, we need to calculate 3/5 of 700.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find the number of students who left through exit C. This can be done by subtracting the number of students who left through exit B from the remaining students.

Number of students who left through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28 (32 - 4 = 28).

We're told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium 'x'. The total number of fish is then 2x.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Let's break down the cost of the makeup for the movie. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and it takes 6 hours to do each day. 

Cost per day = $250 * 6 hours = $1500
Since Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is:
Cost for 4 days a week = $1500 * 4 = $6000
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost is:
Cost for 5 weeks = $6000 * 5 = $30,000

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost.
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000
Total amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the school has 3 classes with 20 students in each class. So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

We're also given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

Now, let's find the number of boys in the third class. We know that the total number of boys in the school is 30, and the number of boys in the first two classes is 33. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3."
"Let's figure out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now. He started with 61 apps. Then, he deleted 9 apps he didn't use anymore. To find out how many apps he has left, we need to subtract 9 from 61.

61 - 9 = 52

After deleting 9 apps, Travis had 52 apps left. Then, he downloaded 18 more apps. To find out the total number of apps he has now, we need to add 18 to 52.

52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Let's break down the information given: Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"Let's figure out where Bill is now. To do that, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Sylas initially had 10 stalls with 20 cows each. That's a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Then, he bought 40 more cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:

40 / 10 = 4

So, each stall now has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. To do this, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank. 

First, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill. 
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay for returning her overdue books.

First, we need to find the cost of the overdue books. Since she owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, we multiply the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's calculate the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup. 

To do this, we need to find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"Let's count Maddison's marbles. She has 5 boxes, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Maddison then receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the new total, we add the marbles she received to the marbles she already had.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, let's find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the information given. Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"Let's break down the costs associated with buying the house. The selling price of the house is $350,000. On top of that, Mrs. Cruz has to pay a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This comes out to be 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

Next, there's the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price. This amounts to 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

To find the total price of the house, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee together. This gives us $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Now, let's compare this total price to Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000. The difference between the two is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Now, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it takes to heat up to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook. 

20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

"Let's calculate the total number of M&Ms Mary got. 

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. 
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. To find the total number of bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms in each house: 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we know each bedroom has 2 windows. So, we multiply the total number of bedrooms by the number of windows in each bedroom: 6 * 2 = 12.

However, we're not done yet. There are 4 additional windows in each house that aren't connected to the bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, we multiply the number of additional windows in each house by the total number of houses: 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms to the total number of additional windows to find the overall number of windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given. The body of the sweater requires 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that number, and the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. 

First, we need to find the number of stitches for the collar. Since it takes a tenth of the body's stitches, that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

Next, we determine the number of stitches for the rosette, which is twice as many as the collar, so that's 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we add the stitches for the collar and the rosette to find their total: 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, and the body takes 900 stitches. So, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds. 

First, we need to find the cost of the tomato seeds. Since she bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet, the total cost of the tomato seeds is 20 * $40 = $800.

Next, we need to find the cost of the celery seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet, so the total cost of the celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together to find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds. $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"Let's break down the information given. Sean has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which means it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 80 cards in total.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a large hole. We need to find out how many hours it will take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig the small holes. Since it takes 3 minutes per hole and there are 30 holes, we multiply 3 minutes by 30. That's 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig the large holes. It takes 10 minutes per hole and there are 15 holes, so we multiply 10 minutes by 15. That's 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together. 90 minutes + 150 minutes is 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 240 minutes divided by 60 is 4 hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20. To find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two pieces of information about Ruby and Sam's ages.

First, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be expressed as R = 6S, where R is Ruby's age and S is Sam's age.

The second piece of information tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be expressed as (R + 9) = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's calculate the total amount Peter paid for the popsicles and ice cream bars.

First, we need to find the cost of the popsicles. Since he purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half the number of spots as a cobra, which means a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras in the snake park, so the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

There are 60 mambas in the snake park, so the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on both cobras and mambas, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game, and we need to figure out how much she'll spend.

First, we need to calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 15 people right there. But each team member brings 2 guests, which means there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Adding those to the team members and coaches, we get a total of 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Now, we need to figure out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so to find the total amount Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * 15 = $195.

"I'm Anastasia, a jewelry designer with a passion for creating exquisite pieces. My specialty is topaz necklaces, and I'm often asked about the intricacies of my craft. Let's dive into the details of one of my signature necklaces.

To create a 25-inch topaz necklace, I use 8 topaz gemstones, each measuring 1 inch in length. The space between these gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, which are 1/4 inch long each.

First, I calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Next, I determine the total length of the spaces between the gemstones. There are 7 spaces between the 8 gemstones, and each space is filled with a sterling silver bead. Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, the total length of the spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, I subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, I already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, I divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, I use 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled her stories, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled his stories, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled her stories, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

To find the total number of stories written in the second week, we add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

Now, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week to find the total number of stories written altogether: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's figure out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years. 

First, we need to find out how old he is now. Since Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2. 

9 * 2 = 18

So, Ann's brother is 18 years old now. 

In 3 years, he will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars, one in the fast lane and one in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate its time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Now, we need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at 30 miles per hour, we can use the same formula:
time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: 16"

2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

To find out how much she earns, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Mike initially has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's solve this problem together. 

First, we need to find out how many oranges the youngest son is. Since he is half as old as the oldest son, and the oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest son must be 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we know that both sons wash the same number of oranges as their age. So, the oldest son washes 8 oranges and the youngest son washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Darren's workout routine over two days. On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

The total count of activities in two days is 170 + 200 = 370."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Sam's bread sales for the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so we'll ignore those days. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates.

To find the total number of crates sold, we add up the sales from each day: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Now, let's compare this to his target of 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55.

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Carmen starts with a bid of $200 and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 bids from the other people, and then 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of these 6 bids. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200 (the initial bid), d = 50 (the increase in each bid), and n = 6 (the total number of bids). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"Let's break down John's driving expenses. He commutes 30 miles to work and back each day, which is a total of 60 miles per day. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, his weekly commute is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Over the course of 50 weeks in a year, John's total commute is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year. 

John is charged $2 per mile, so his total driving cost is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, his total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"Let's break down Peter's exercise routine. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. To find out how many minutes he exercised in total on those two days, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Now, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. To find this out, we multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"The problem of determining the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is quite intriguing. Let's break it down step by step.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. 

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down Annika's expenses at the town fair. She started with $50. 

First, she spent half of it on food and snacks. To find half of $50, we divide 50 by 2, which equals $25. 

Annika also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 (on food and snacks) + $10 (on rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. We can do this by subtracting the number of unsold books, the number of books sold this year, and the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books.

Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"Let's break down Watson's earnings for April. He works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. To find his total hours worked in a week, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In addition to his hourly wage, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Since April has 4 weeks, we can find Watson's total earnings for the month by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"Let's calculate how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling match. 

To find the number of people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people. 

20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60.

Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4. 

4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks."
"Let's calculate the savings on the items. 

First, we need to find the savings on the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, we'll calculate the savings on the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

Now, let's add the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk to find the total savings. $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"The Lots-of-Limbs Serum is quite the fascinating concoction, isn't it? To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately.

Let's start with the extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every three days, we can divide the total number of days by 3 to find out how many extra arms will be grown. 15 days divided by 3 days per arm equals 5 extra arms.

Moving on to the extra legs, the person grows an extra leg every five days. To find out how many extra legs will be grown, we divide the total number of days by 5. 15 days divided by 5 days per leg equals 3 extra legs.

Now, let's add the extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, he buys 6 business suits at $100 each, which costs him 6 * $100 = $600. Then, he purchases 3 suitcases at $50 each, totaling 3 * $50 = $150. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of his flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract his total expenses from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

However, Theo wants to save $2000 for his trip, so we subtract this from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 5, and three of them eat 3 eggs each day, while the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the three people who eat 3 eggs each day. That's 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the two people who eat 2 eggs each day. That's 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs eaten in a day, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily total by 7 to find the total number of eggs eaten in a week: 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. Since then, Noah has aged 6 years, so his current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is twice the population six years ago, which is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of players on the football team is 105. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D, and the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, let's solve for D by dividing both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. 

First, we need to find the total number of people invited. 
2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

But, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna, we simply add these two numbers together: 20 + 50 = 70.

Now, Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find out how many marbles his father gave him, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20. This is done by multiplying 20 by 2 and then dividing the result by 5: (2 * 20) / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now that we know Solomon received 8 more marbles from his father, we can find the total number of marbles in the store by adding this to the previous total: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. We're also told that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

First, let's calculate the number of girls. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, we multiply the number of boys by 3:
Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we need to find the number of nongendered children. We're told that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so we multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pencils are in each box. Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shannon makes iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Additionally, any added liquid also weakens the coffee.

First, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees. We want to cool it down to 35 degrees. The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Now, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100, so we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
= 2 * 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so we can multiply the number of junior programmers by their salary:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to find the salary of senior programmers. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers. We can multiply the number of senior programmers by their salary:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Before that, 8 people got in at the second bus stop. So, at the second bus stop, there were 20 - 8 = 12 people on the bus.

Now, let's go back to the first bus stop. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off, so before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus. 

We know that at the first bus stop, 5 people got in. So, before the first bus stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure. He starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he shares 14 with his friends, bringing his total down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave away, which is 2 * 14 = 28. Adding these to his remaining lollipops, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

The next day, Oscar eats 3 lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33. Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, bringing his total down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's solve this problem together. Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the customer's shopping trip. They spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which earned them $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned 4 rewards, making it $4 off their next purchase.

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the information given for the two job options. 

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for Job A. Since the state has a 20% total tax rate, we multiply the total income by the tax rate: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 

Now, we subtract the income tax from the total income to find the net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Moving on to Job B, we know the total income is $42,000. However, there's an additional property tax of $6,000. We subtract the property tax from the total income to find the net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

Next, we calculate the income tax for Job B. The state charges a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. We multiply the net income before tax by the tax rate: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.

Now, we subtract the income tax from the net income before tax to find the net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"The task at hand is to determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland. To begin, we need to find 40% of the total number of castles, which is 220.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find this number, we'll divide the total number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes to determine the cost difference.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. Subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from Furniture United's offer, we get $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's calculate the total number of paintball guns they have. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, let's divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people.

24 / 4 = 6

If they were to share their guns equally, each person would have 6 guns."
"Let's calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

To find the amount of sugar needed for the suckers, we multiply the number of batches by the amount of sugar needed per batch: 8 batches * 30 ounces/batch = 240 ounces.

Next, we add the amount of sugar needed for the fudge: 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

So, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which means the price of each share becomes $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + 0.5 * $8 = $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the decrease, we calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. So, the price of each share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria has 8 shares, we multiply the price of each share after the second year by the total number of shares to find the total value of all her shares: 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"Let's break down the information given. Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, which means Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, let's find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we need to divide the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2. So, John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Then, the number of students in the smallest group would be x - 10.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can say that H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

Now, we can substitute H with 2C in the second equation, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"The poor dear Josh. He's been practicing juggling for weeks, and now he's about to perform at the school talent show. Let's see how many balls he's juggling with. He starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. That's a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

But, oh no! Josh slips and drops 3 balls on stage. Luckily, 2 of them are caught by the kind people in the crowd, but 1 ball gets lost in the dark auditorium. So, Josh is left with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. We also know that the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals. The blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each, as they weigh the same as the pink frog. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird, and the container.

The total weight is: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

First, we add 24 and 48: 24 + 48 = 72
Then, we add 15 to that result: 72 + 15 = 87

So, Laurel now has a total of 87 baby outfits for her little one."
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"Let's break down the prices of the juice boxes. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. That would be 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenny buys a bag of cookies that contains 36 cookies. Her son puts 4 cookies in his lunch box every day for 5 days, which means he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he consumes 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband: 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag: 36 - 27 = 9.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 40% of $30.

40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to compare the current daily earnings to the previous daily earnings.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor, so their previous daily earnings were 10 * $100 = $1000.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, so their current daily earnings are 5 * $220 = $1100.

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the previous earnings from the current earnings: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the previous earnings and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to consider the costs of food, treats, and medicine.

First, let's determine the cost of food per month. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. Therefore, the total cost per month is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total cost per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. So, the total cost per year is $220 * 12 = $2640.

"Let's break down John's activities during his vacation. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30. This gives us 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.40 by the total time: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Morgan's dad has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to spend it on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and Morgan and her friends will play one round. The cost of the mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down Marisa's daily expenses and savings. She gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, we need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. 
25 cents = $0.25
So, 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Billy starts with $10 that his father gave him. He buys some candy at $1.5 per pound, and then he spends half of his change on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. We know he bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Now, we know that Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. This means the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the change he had after buying the candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5x.

The amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x. Since he took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs, we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this as an equation:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. To do this, we add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Let's break down John's trip into two parts: driving to his friend's house and driving back home.

To find the time taken to drive to his friend's house, we need to consider the detour. The original distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. 

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. We know his speed is 70 mph. Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

For the return trip, John drives 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. To find the time taken, we use the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's add the time taken for both parts of the trip to find the total time. Total time = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, and 43 of them are girls. On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.

First, we need to find the total number of students who were absent. We can do this by adding the number of absent girls and the number of absent boys.

Total number of students absent = 5 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 9

Now, we need to find the number of students who were present. We can do this by subtracting the total number of students absent from the total number of fourth-graders.

Number of students present = Total number of fourth-graders - Total number of students absent
= 96 - 9
= 87

Next, we need to find the number of boys who were present. We can do this by subtracting the number of girls who were present from the total number of students present.

Number of girls present = Total number of girls - Number of absent girls
= 43 - 5
= 38

Number of boys present = Number of students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38
= 49

The final answer is: 49"

3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. 

A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
S = 4 * 3 - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
V = 3 * S
V = 3 * 7
V = 21

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 
Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. 
The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Let's break down the shoe sale. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance. To do this, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is: 67"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as he does, which means she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. Additionally, Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together: 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150 silver pesos.

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together: 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200 gold pesos.

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos: 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. To find the total profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means he has 2/5 of his land remaining.

To find the initial amount of land, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. We can write the equation as:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the choir has 52 members, and 50% of them are boys and 50% are girls. To find the number of girls, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people performing, we need to add the number of girls who can make it to the show (26 - 13 = 13) to the number of teachers (3).

The total number of people performing is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of scores to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.

First, we need to find the cost of 6 erasers. Since each eraser costs $2, we multiply 6 by $2 to get the total cost of the erasers: 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we calculate the cost of 8 pencils. Each pencil costs $3, so we multiply 8 by $3 to get the total cost of the pencils: 8 * $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and pencils together to get the total cost: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's break down the problem. James is delivering messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. He delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we need to calculate 1/3 of the messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

1/3 of 66 is 22. So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Now, we need to find the total number of messages James delivers. We can do this by adding the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"Let's break down the situation. David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket. Alternatively, you can buy a ride bracelet for $30, which gives you 9 rides.

To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

The cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, so the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm happy to help you with Monica's gift-wrapping dilemma. Let's break it down step by step.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. To find out how many gifts she has in total, we need to add these numbers together.

6 (family) + 4 (friends) = 10
10 + 2 (teachers) = 12

So, Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap. She wants to make a bow for each gift using 144 inches of ribbon. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

First, let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, let's find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"The thrill of cutting the cord and embracing the world of streaming services. Tim has decided to cancel his cable subscription and opt for a more modern approach. He's signed up for Netflix, which costs a reasonable $10 a month.

Now, let's talk about the bundled deal for Hulu and Disney Plus. Normally, each of these services would cost Tim $10 a month, making the total $20. However, by bundling them together, he gets a 20% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of $20.

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding the cost of Netflix to this, we get a total of $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of his cable subscription, which was $60 a month. By switching to streaming services, Tim saves $60 - $26 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break down Carol's time spent on her song. She spent 4 hours writing it, which is half the time she spent recording it. So, she must have spent 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording it. 

As for editing, she spent 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time she spent on her song: 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"Let's figure out how many books Wendy needs to carry. First, we need to find out how many books are already in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

To complete her task, Wendy will need to carry 92 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards.

Next, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

After giving away 29 cards, Erica had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices. She decides to share it with Bill and Mark. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. Then, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices. Now, let's consider what happened next. Jenny also ate 2 slices of the pizza for herself.

To find out how many slices are left, we need to subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices. The total number of slices given away and eaten is 7 + 2 = 9.

Now, let's do the math: 12 (original slices) - 9 (slices given away and eaten) = 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs four times the ingredients of the normal recipe. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.

To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. The total amount of flour required is 4 * 3 cups, which equals 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get 6 bags of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. The total amount of milk required is 4 * 1 cup, which equals 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get 2 bottles of milk.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk. This is simply 6 (bags of flour) - 2 (bottles of milk), which equals 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy used per day. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and it's used for 8 hours a day, the original energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches for the big game, we need to determine how many sandwiches Tyson should make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so Tyson needs 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he initially has 40 cannolis. This means he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Now, Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

To find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis he bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200."
"Let's break down Elliott's steps. He wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. To find out how many words are in the book, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page: 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Since he can read 300 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to finish reading the book and travel to the airport within 60 minutes. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he has 60 minutes - 30 minutes = 30 minutes to travel to the airport.

However, it actually takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, not 30 minutes. So, we subtract the travel time from the time he has available: 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be at the airport in 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that in May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each of them $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. To find the total amount paid to each employee in May, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each employee and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Since each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to all employees in May. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to all employees in June. Since there are 30 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to add the total amount paid in May and June. The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Let's break down Sally's expenses at the seashore. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, which is a special deal where one pound costs $3 and the other pound is half off. So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

To find the discount, I'll calculate 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

Now, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a finale firework that costs $150.

To find the total amount spent, I'll add the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Marcy makes 50000 candles, and 5% of them smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that smell like wet dog, we multiply 50000 by 0.05, which equals 2500.

However, we're not just looking for candles that smell like wet dog. We want to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. The problem states that 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. To find the number of candles that are more dangerous, we multiply 50000 by 0.01, which equals 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. To find this number, we multiply 500 by 0.05, which equals 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's dive into the problem. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 bumps. Camels have two humps each, while dromedaries have one hump each. To find the number of dromedaries, we need to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation based on this information:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now, let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation will help us eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

"Let's break down Tom's two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3, which equals 240 km. So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Stanley was initially standing at an elevation of 10,000 feet. When the comb fell, it dropped 4,000 feet to a ledge below. To find the elevation where the comb landed, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

First, four boats came and took away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat took: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the cost of the streaming service for Bill. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip. 

First, we need to find the capacity of the buses. There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees. So, the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we'll calculate the capacity of the minibusses. There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees. So, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we'll find the capacity of the minivans. There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees. So, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, the homemade feeders must attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders: 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the costs of Aleksandra's dinner. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He has $50 in spending cash, so he needs to make $50 from selling his Pokémon cards. Each card is sold for $1.5.

To find out how many cards Kenny needs to sell, we can divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests, but 40 guests showed up. Since everyone wanted a second hotdog, we need to find out how many hotdogs were prepared and how many were needed.

The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. This means 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs, and the other 18 guests were prepared for one hotdog each. 

To find the total number of hotdogs prepared, we multiply the number of hotdogs each group was prepared for: 18 * 2 + 18 * 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem. Indras has 6 letters in her name. To find the number of letters in her sister's name, we need to calculate half of the letters in Indras' name and then add 4 to that number.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down Charlotte's order step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. Charlotte gets a 20% discount on her order. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte needs to pay: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"Let's calculate how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"The tale of the brave princes and their dragon-slaying exploits is quite the legend. Let's break it down, shall we?

Prince Thaddeus, the mighty warrior, slew 100 dragons with his trusty sword. Prince Arthur, with his spear, managed to slay three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we need to calculate three quarters of 100, which is 75.

Now, Prince Walter, the axe-wielding hero, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we multiply 75 by 2 to get 150 dragons.

Lastly, Prince Bruce, the nail file-wielding prince, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we divide 150 by 5, which equals 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. To do this, we multiply 3 by 0.25 (since 1/4 is the same as 0.25).

3 * 0.25 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money. Since 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, 99% of his money is equal to $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.

The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20. The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20.

Now, let's find out how much money George spent on candy bars. The amount of money George spent on candy bars is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533. Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's solve the problem together. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops he shared with his friends, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends. Ray has 4 friends, so we'll divide 20 by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 equal pieces. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find out how much cake is left.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. To do this, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each have a piece, so we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. Since they each had one piece, the total weight eaten is equal to the weight of two pieces.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many oranges everyone will get. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. To find the total number of oranges, we add them together: 34 + 22 = 56.

Now, they want to share these oranges with their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people. To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"Bonjour! Let's calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup. 

First, we need to determine the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the situation. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, we need to figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to add 5 minutes to Bernadette's travel time. This is because Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, Bernadette needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, we multiply 3 yards by 3 to get the length in feet: 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now that we have the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, so we divide the area by the length to find the width: 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of the length and width. So, we multiply 2 by the sum of 9 and 40: 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the situation. Marcus wakes up to a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and his oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's consider the effect of the open window. Marcus leaves the window open for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down by 2 degrees. Therefore, for 30 minutes, it cools down by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window from the initial temperature. The initial temperature is 40 degrees, the oven increases it by 15 degrees, and the window decreases it by 6 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Jon's times for the swim, bike, and run are 40 minutes, 80 minutes, and 50 minutes, respectively. 

To find James' total time, we need to consider the changes in his times compared to Jon's. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. He takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"Let's break down the information given. Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B. So, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4. Therefore, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since it's running at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a set of magician's cards with different colors. There are 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"Let's break down the situation. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies.

75 - 30 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots. To do this, we first need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together to find the total weight of the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. 

Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, so three cans are worth 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 
Plastic bottles are worth three cents each, so five bottles are worth 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her weekly earnings, we add the value of the cans and bottles: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Frederick has 10 plants. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the situation. Leila gave Ali half of her $100. To find out how much she gave him, we need to divide $100 by 2.

$100 / 2 = $50

Ali already had $21. Now, we need to add the amount Leila gave him to the amount he already had.

$21 + $50 = $71

So, Ali now has $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we multiply $15 by 1/5.

1/5 of $15 = (1/5) * $15
1/5 of $15 = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"Let's break down Finley's movements in the 100-meter race. 

She started in 1st place. 
Then she fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. 
Next, she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4th place.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards. To find the total number of basketball cards, we multiply the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck: 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of baseball cards. Miss Maria has five boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box. We multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box: 5 * 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards Miss Maria has: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, we subtract this number from the total to find out how many cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Finally, we divide the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student receives to find out how many students Miss Maria has: 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there's a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there's a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 1000 cents. To do this, we multiply 1000 cents by 0.1: 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now that we know how much both Becky and Kelly paid, we can find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Total number of items per room: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

Now, multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Fireman Frank initially has 200 shoes. 

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. Now, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. So, he now has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. Therefore, he now has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we need to subtract 180 from 300. 

300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. To do that, we need to know how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of the paper. Since it costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, we'll start by calculating three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2, so three times that is 3 * $2 = $6.

Now, we subtract $1 from $6 to find the cost of the paper. $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, we need to find the change she received. To do that, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave the cashier. $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student started the year with 10 pencils. 

First, we need to find the total number of pencils initially in the class. 
Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. 
Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, let's find the remaining pencils after two months. 
Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 
Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's solve the problem together. Matt's dad has a deal with him: for every carrot stick Matt eats, he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?

Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats 'x'. According to the deal, the number of cookies he gets is (1/2)x + 2. Since Matt wants to eat five cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a 10-foot shark with 2 remoras attached to it, and each remora is 6 inches long. To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their length from inches to feet.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing it by 12. 

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Now that we know the length of one remora in feet, we can find the combined length of the two remoras by multiplying the length of one remora by 2.

Combined length of remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. To do this, we'll divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve this problem together. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We're given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, and this number represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

To find the total number of students, we can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

"Let's figure out how many books each of Sarah's 4 kids got.

First, we need to find out how many books Sarah bought in total. We know she spent $300 and each book costs $15.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 9 kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

So, we add 9 (dairy) and 6 (peanuts), which gives us 15. Then, we subtract 3 (both) to get 12. This is the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts.

Now, we need to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything. To do this, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class. There are 32 kids in Gina's class, so we subtract 12 from 32.

32 - 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given. We have 3 groups of employees, and each group consists of 200 employees. To find the total number of employees, we multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group: 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we need to consider the tour guides. Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups. To find the total number of tour guides, we multiply the number of groups by the number of tour guides in each group: 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 + 21 = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"Let's break down the cost of Tom's anniversary getaway.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two tickets, each costing $5000, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend. To calculate the new price, we multiply the normal price by 1.2, which gives us 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they're staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"Let's break down the information given. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's solve this problem together. We have two kinds of pennies: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny and then the combined weight of both pennies.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, let's find the combined weight of the two pennies. We add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny: 36 + 48 = 84 grains.

"Let's calculate how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn for their baseball camp.

Keegan has earned $83 by 3 pm, and Tasha has earned $91. To find the total amount they have earned so far, we add these two amounts together.

Total amount earned = $83 + $91 = $174

Now, we need to subtract this total from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need to earn.

Amount needed to reach the goal = $200 - $174 = $26

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the problem. Gabriel has 20 songs on his portable media player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since the player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add. So, 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked from the farm. If they picked a total of 60 oranges, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate.

To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide the result by 5. 
2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate. 

To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 * $10 = $240

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jillian's shoes cost $80. To find the cost of her handbag, we need to calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes.

3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Now, we're told that the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. So, we subtract $20 from $240 to find the cost of the handbag.

Cost of handbag = $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's break down James' running routine. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. To find out how many miles he runs in a week, we multiply the miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

Miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

"Let's calculate how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days.

First, we need to find out how much oats his horses consume in a day. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so we divide the total amount of oats consumed (200 pounds) by the amount in each bag (50 pounds).

200 / 50 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jana has a total of 27 puppies. To find out how many of them are Pomeranians, we need to calculate two thirds of 27.

Two thirds of 27 is calculated as (2/3) * 27. To do this, we multiply 2 by 27 and then divide the result by 3.

(2 * 27) = 54
54 / 3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as (1/3) * 18.

(1 * 18) = 18
18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: 6"

Then, divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"Let's calculate how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount for the toy car.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the amount already saved from the total cost.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount for the toy car.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather buys razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They're on sale, buy one get one free, and she has a $2.00 coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which is $4.00. She also gets a $2.00 discount with her coupon, so the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's find out how many razors Heather will get in total. Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

"Let's break down Charisma's walking schedule. She works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour. To find the total number of minutes she walks in a day, we multiply the number of hours she works by the number of minutes she walks per hour.

8 hours * 5 minutes per hour = 40 minutes per day

Since Charisma works for 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by the number of days.

40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how old Brett will be in four years. Since he's 14 years old now, we add 4 to his current age: 14 + 4 = 18.

Now, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42.

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"Let's break down the problem. Mark is considering two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, while the second charges $25 per person. However, the first venue doesn't include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 per person. The second venue includes food in the price.

To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We can set up the equation: 200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: 10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

Now, let's write the equation based on the given information: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by her grandma are:
1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

"Let's break down the information given: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"Let's calculate how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget. 

First, we need to find out which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar. A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50. 

On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide this total by 4:
16 / 4 = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"

"Let's break down Julie's expenses step by step.

First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after buying clothes: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after buying CDs: $400 - $100 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We're also told that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the number of bags by the selling price: 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight in minutes and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Kelsie made. We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of the number of cookies that Suzanne made. To find out how many cookies Josh made, we need to divide 36 by 4.

36 / 4 = 9

So Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to calculate the total from the $10 bills and the $20 bills separately.

First, let's find the total from the $10 bills: 4 * $10 = $40. Then, let's find the total from the $20 bills: 6 * $20 = $120. Now, we add these two totals together to get the overall amount of money Ali has: $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. To find half of the total, we divide $160 by 2: $160 / 2 = $80. After giving his sister half, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply $80 by 3/5: (3/5) * $80 = $48. After buying dinner, Ali is left with $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. To find out how long it takes him in minutes, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we're told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. To find out how long Royce takes, we need to calculate double the time it takes Rob and then add 40 minutes. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to that gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm happy to help you with Martha's wool shopping list. To determine how many skeins of wool she needs, let's calculate the total for each item.

For the hats, Martha will need 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins. 

For the scarves, she'll need 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins.

For the sweaters, Martha will need 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins.

For the mittens, she'll need 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins.

For the socks, Martha will need 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item: 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins.

The final answer is: 63"
"Let's break down Chris's math homework progress. He has a total of 100 math problems to complete.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm, and I'm excited to help figure out how many quarts of strawberries we can pick per hour. Let's start by looking at how many quarts each of us can pick.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's think about Kathy. She can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Lastly, we have Ricky. He picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of us can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"Let's calculate the number of loaves of bread left at the Beverly Hills Bakery. 

First, we need to find the total number of loaves sold. The bakers sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. 

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Now, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked. The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

Total loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold - Loaves returned
Total loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Total loaves left = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Let's calculate the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant.

To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down Ada's electric consumption and calculate the difference in her weekly bill.

First, we need to find out how much Ada consumes per week before and after adding the new device. 

Her daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and she uses electricity for 7 hours a day. So, her weekly consumption before adding the device is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt hour. Therefore, her weekly bill before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Now, let's consider the new device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. After adding this device, Ada's daily consumption becomes 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her weekly consumption after adding the device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of electricity after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

To find the difference in her weekly electric bill, we subtract the cost before adding the device from the cost after adding the device: $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to figure out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Since 5 people can work together, they can paint half a house in 1 day (because 5 people can do the work that 1 person does in 5 days in 1 day). 

Now, we know that 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, so they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24. So, 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, spending a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Tom spent on the headphone set. We subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount spent: $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. We divide the money spent on the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 ÷ $4 = 11.

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on both the headphone set and the CD. We divide the total amount spent by the cost of one CD: $48 ÷ $4 = 12.

Finally, we subtract the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD from the number of CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set to find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set: 11 - 1 = 10.

"Let's break down Josh's workout routine. He spent 4 hours working out every week except for a few occasions. There was a time when he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, and another time when he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's figure out how many passengers get on at the second stop. It says 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the information given: Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. If the computer cost $1,100, we need to find the cost of one monitor.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 seashells each. To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of seashells each brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.

First, we calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 60 + 240 = 300.

So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add this to the total number of seashells brought by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we let the number of candies George had initially be x, then Nick had 2x candies initially.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 8.

Since Nick had 2x candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick has by multiplying 2 and 8, which gives us 16.

So, Nick has 16 candies."
"Let's figure out how old Anne is. We know Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. To find Alyana's age, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's calculate the total thickness of the four books on the shelf.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

To find out how many vlogs she should make to complete her goal, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made. 

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, let's subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make:
72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he needed some money and spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he saved some more and was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the final amount, we multiply $13 by 3, which gives us $13 * 3 = $39.

"Let's break down Elvis's monthly saving goal. He wants to save a total of $1125 in April. To make it more manageable, he plans to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

The total amount saved in the first half is the amount saved per day in the first half (y) multiplied by the number of days in the first half (x), which is xy. The total amount saved in the second half is twice the amount saved per day in the first half (2y) multiplied by the number of days in the second half (30 - x), which is 2y(30 - x).

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2y(30 - x). We know this total is equal to $1125.

We can simplify the equation: xy + 2y(30 - x) = 1125.

Expanding the equation, we get xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125.

Combining like terms, we get -xy + 60y = 1125.

Factoring out y, we get y(-x + 60) = 1125.

Dividing both sides by (-x + 60), we get y = 1125 / (-x + 60).

However, we know that x is the number of days in the first half of April, and the total number of days in April is 30. So, x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30.

This means x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation y = 1125 / (-x + 60) to find y: y = 1125 / (60 - 15) = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought. She purchased three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he completes, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task she completes. Both of them finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much Jairus will get in total, we multiply the amount he gets per task by the number of tasks he completed: 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Now, let's do the same for Jenny: 0.5 * 20 = $10.

To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to subtract Jenny's total from Jairus' total: 16 - 10 = $6.

"Let's solve the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and together they have 100 dollars. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"

"Let's break down Elise's writing process step by step. 

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

"Let's solve this problem together. To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 * $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 * $10 = $10

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's calculate the total cost of Carly's order. She buys five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each.

First, we calculate the cost of the hamburgers: 5 x $4 = $20
Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries: 10 x $0.30 = $3
Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks: 5 x $2 = $10

Now, we add the costs together to find the total: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission. This is calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

The sales over $1000 are $2500 - $1000 = $1500. For these sales, she earns an additional 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total commission, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"Let's figure out how many water bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he already has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Now, let's calculate how many bottles he needs for his guests. He has 70 guests, and he wants 2 bottles for each guest. That's 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

In total, Bill needs 140 bottles for his guests and the 48 bottles he already has. So, he needs a total of 140 + 48 = 188 bottles.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that when the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does on a cold day. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Twice the time = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down John's income and savings plan. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. To find his daily earnings, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a day:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since John works 4 days a week, we need to calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, let's determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80. We can do this by dividing the target savings by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's calculate the total cost of lunch at Subway. 

First, we need to find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it's three times as much as the foot-long fish sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost.

Total cost for both subs: $40 + $120 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's count the holes in the buttons. There are 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

Now, let's count the buttons with 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are 21 - 7 = 14. These 14 buttons have 4 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the holes from the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and her husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. We also know that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

First, we need to find out how many cups Juan currently drinks. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks x/2 cups. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, so he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. So, x = 4. Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's count the rodents in the pet shop. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters. And there are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

To find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the information given. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3. The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the angle the sun moves. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground when standing at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun moves for 10 hours, and we need to calculate the total angle it moves during this time.

Angle moved by the sun per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle moved by the sun to find the final angle from the ground to the sun.

Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

"Let's calculate the number of candles James needs for his sons' birthday. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 8 years old.

To find the total number of candles needed, we add the ages of both sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3, we need to determine how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"Let's break down Judy's reading habits. In the first week, she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, let's figure out how many pages she read in the first week. Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"Let's solve this problem together. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"Let's break down Peter's action figure purchases. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures, which cost $5 each. 

In 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ford grows 40 roses every week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"Let's break down the costs and revenue for the food truck.

To find the total cost, we need to consider the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they're selling 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"Let's break down the cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom. 

First, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom. Since it measures 18 feet by 12 feet, the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of labor. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864. The contractor also charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the cost of the materials and labor. The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 = $3024. The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

"The oven is malfunctioning, and Maggie needs to adjust the temperature accordingly. To find the correct temperature, we first need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18. To find the percentage, we divide this difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the actual temperature for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we calculate 4% of 520: (4/100) * 520 = 20.8. 

The actual temperature for the recipe is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8. However, since Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we'll round to the nearest whole number. 

To find the temperature she should set the oven to, we need to subtract the percentage by which the oven is off from the actual temperature. The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Herb paid $76,000 for his house. To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

30% of Herb's house price is 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800. Now, we subtract this from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.

Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses. We simply add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together.

Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last him 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day:
90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Now, let's find the total number of days the contacts will last:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

Next, we need to find the cost of the contacts. The original price of 2 boxes is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200

However, there's a 10% discount, so we need to subtract that from the original price:
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

"Let's break down Hannah's activities and calculate the total calories burned. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Now, let's determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. To find out how many 200-calorie units there are, we divide the total calories burned by 200.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100.

8 * 100 = 800

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"The Burger Palace restaurant has a jar filled with red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. We know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Since the total number of jelly beans is 4500, we can write the equation B + R + G = 4500. Substituting the expressions for R and G, we get B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. Combining like terms, we get 3.01B = 4500. Dividing both sides by 3.01, we find that B = 1500.

Now that we know B, we can find R and G. R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485, and G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract R from G: G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that eating Cheerios every day for breakfast results in a weight loss of 1.25 pounds per week, while eating donuts every day for breakfast results in a weight gain of 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option. 

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Now, let's multiply the weight change per week by the number of weeks to find the total weight change for each option:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Now, let's find the difference in weight between the two options:
8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the information given. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. This means the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited by Alex's friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people invited by Alex's friends: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her.

The final answer is: 319"
"Let's break down the weights of the dogs in the waiting room. The first dog, an Affenpinscher, weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund next to him weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, which is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Moving on, the Papillon sitting next to the Dachshund weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. To find this, we divide the Dachshund's weight by 4: 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the Mastiff at the end of the line. It's mentioned that the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, we multiply the Papillon's weight by 44: 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay. The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's solve this problem together. We know that Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, and the beanstalk starts at 4 feet. It doubles in height every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to first determine how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's solve the problem together. 

Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down George's dental expenses. He needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the total base price for the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

However, he wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, let's calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount. He makes $15 per hour at work. To find the number of hours, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x, respectively.

Now, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

First, we need to convert all the coins into cents. 8 quarters equal 8 x 25 cents, which is 200 cents. 6 dimes equal 6 x 10 cents, which is 60 cents. 14 nickels equal 14 x 5 cents, which is 70 cents. And 15 pennies equal 15 x 1 cent, which is 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"Let's count the legs of all the pets in the store. We have 5 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from dogs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Next, we have 2 cats, and each cat has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from cats is 2 x 4 = 8.

Lastly, we have 10 birds, and each bird has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs from birds is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. To find the weight after increasing it by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the years. 

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday gifts and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4. 
60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Patrick's lemonade sales. For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. To find the total amount earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and multiply it by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the total amount earned from both periods to find the overall earnings.
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine how long Jeremy's tires will last before needing replacement, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can handle in a month and then divide that by the total number of rotations they can handle in their lifetime.

Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, and his tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. So, the number of rotations per month is:

400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, let's find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. The tires can handle a total of 10,440,000 rotations in their lifetime.

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equal to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine the amount of butter Juan needs to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we find the amount of butter needed per dozen croissants, which is 1/4 pound. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. However, his research takes 10 times longer than expected, which means it lasts for 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months are covered by the initial funding of $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial amount. To find the increased funding, we calculate 50% of $100,000, which is $50,000. So, the increased funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

To find the total cost of the research, we add the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, we can calculate the total number of seats by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of seats by 1/4.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Next, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators occupied their seats. We can do this by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Now, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so we can calculate this by multiplying the remaining seats by 1/3.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we can find out how many seats were occupied by the students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Now, let's calculate the difference in height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference in height by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down James' earnings from selling the used cars.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars. They paid 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, let's find the profit from selling the cars. This is the total cost minus the company's cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit. He earns a 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. This means 25% of 100 riders can stay on the wave.

To find 25% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. If the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of diamond Jewell
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we're told that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we simply add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 

To find the number of rose stamps, we need to know that he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up.

To do this, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. This is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Relative Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up. The distance between them is 75 miles, and the relative speed is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can find out how many fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem. Manny signed up for 10 Karate classes for a total of $60. His parents have a condition that if the classes cost more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. 

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. To find her weekly production, we need to multiply this number by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the information given. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges for Clyde.

First, we need to find the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can multiply this by 5/4 to find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

Next, we need to find the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can multiply this by 5/3 to find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"Let's break down the costs of Bill's new truck. The base price of the truck is $30,000. 

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. 

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's break down Tim's new compensation package. He's getting a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary, which is a significant boost. To calculate the raise, we multiply his current salary by 0.05:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
This means his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

In addition to the raise, Tim is also receiving a bonus worth half a month's salary. Since half of $20,000 is $10,000, his total monthly income will be:
$21,000 (new monthly salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

Now, to find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. To find the total cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total price:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to calculate the total cost without the discount:
20 * $30 = $600
Next, we calculate the discount, which is 10% of $600:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the cost of the first day from the cost of the second day:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down Ariadne's sales. In a particular month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in that month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in that month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in that month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in that month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori needs for her party, we first need to figure out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, we know that Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. To find out how many eggs she needs, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

"Let's break down the information given: Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, we need to find the total cooking time for all the food.

First, let's determine the cooking time for pork. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food:

"Let's dive into the problem. We're given that Lee rears sheep and geese on his farm, and we know the total number of animal legs is 70 and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can represent the total number of legs as 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, so the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

To find the number of sheep, we can solve for G in the second equation: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying 120 by 3/4.

Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can find Rayna's amount by adding 60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

To find out how much money each person would have if they decided to add their money together and share it equally, we need to add up the money of all three and divide it by 3.

Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.
Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the game's duration. The basketball game consists of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. To find the total length of the regular game, we multiply the number of quarters by the length of each quarter: 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.

However, the game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter. To find the total length of the entire game, we add the extra 5 minutes to the regular game time: 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a company with 50 employees, and 20% of them are management. To find the number of management employees, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, we know that 30% of these management employees oversee the entire company. To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we multiply 10 by 0.3.

10 * 0.3 = 3

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For 16 muffins, the amount of flour needed is 16 * 5 = 80 tablespoons.
The amount of sugar needed is 16 * 3 = 48 tablespoons.
The amount of salt needed is 16 * 0.25 = 4 tablespoons.

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together to get the total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: 132"
"Let's figure out how much candy each of them would have after sharing. To do that, we need to add up the total amount of candy they have and then divide it by the number of people.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4
Total candy = 12 pounds

There are 3 people sharing the candy, so we divide the total candy by 3:
12 / 3 = 4

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and the cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.

First, we need to find the total cost of the type A candies: 7 candies * $0.5 = $3.5. Then, we calculate the total cost of the type B candies: 10 candies * $0.75 = $7.5.

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies together: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11. This is the total amount Adam spent on candies.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, we need to find the change he got. To do this, we subtract the total cost of the candies from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down Christina's mood records. We know that over the past thirty days, she had twelve good days and eight bad days, with the rest being neutral. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral.

Now, let's consider the next three days: good, neutral, and good. We need to find out how many good days were left in the month.

We already know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. So, the total number of good days we know about is 8 + 3 = 11. However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in total. To find the number of good days left, we subtract the known good days from the total number of good days: 12 - 11 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Sally has.

Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 2x + 3 books. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Let's solve this problem together. We know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day. Currently, its height is 20 feet, which is equivalent to 240 inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to calculate the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This means there are a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account. 

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/5) * 1200 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment. This is simply the total amount minus Dylan's investment: 1200 - 480 = 720.

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * 720 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment. This is simply the remaining amount minus Frances' investment: 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"Let's break down the problem. Carol and Jennifer have been collecting signatures from celebrities during their summer break. After five weeks, Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. They want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

To find out how many signatures they have in total so far, we add Carol's and Jennifer's signatures together.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

Now, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's figure out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes. To do this, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 6 potatoes : 36 hash browns. 

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns.

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x: 6x = 96 * 36, 6x = 3456, x = 576.

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate the total weight of the 9 adults riding the elevator. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the cookie situation. Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 less cookies than Katarina, we need to subtract 5 from Katarina's total to find Max's cookies. That's 68 - 5 = 63 cookies for Max.

Now, let's figure out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we need to subtract 12 from Max's total. That's 63 - 12 = 51 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we add 23 to Max's total. That's 63 + 23 = 86 cookies for Summer.

Now, let's add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 63 (Max) + 51 (Cookie Monster) + 86 (Summer) = 268

However, I made a mistake. The correct total is actually 268."
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm happy to help you with Shania's dress design problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length and added 20cm to the bottom. The final design is 140cm long. To find the original length, we need to account for both the extension and the added lace trim.

Let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Chris has a two-speed lawn mower that can mow his entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in ""turtle"" mode or 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode. Today, he decided to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode.

First, we need to find the time it took for each mode. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the fire station. They spend 6 minutes getting to the corner where the library is, and then another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

Time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, let's find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late. They have a total of 30 minutes to get to school. 

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

"Let's solve this cookie conundrum. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and her partner Celinda bakes twice as many. To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we multiply Greta's number by 2: 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked together: 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

After they've had a snack and eaten 10 cookies, we subtract that from the total: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies left in the box."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two pieces of information: the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44, and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet.

The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44

The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"Let's break down John's schedule. He has 3 hours before dinner, which is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. To find the total time spent on homework, we add these together: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. 

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. To do this, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"Let's break down John's vet bill. He needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so that's a total of 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the cost of the fruits in the crate. 

First, we need to find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the information given about Brittany's quilted comforter. It has 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. We know there are 14 red squares, and the number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares. The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, and the number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.

First, we calculate the number of blue squares: 14 (red) + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Next, we calculate the number of green squares: 18 (blue) + 6 = 24 green squares.

Then, we calculate the number of white squares: 24 (green) - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's figure out how many chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get for the function. 

First, we need to find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, we need to find out the total number of chairs needed. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so we add those together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Next, we find the total number of chairs available by adding the number of high chairs and regular chairs.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Finally, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

"Let's break down the points collected by each student in class 3B.

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know he has 30 points less than Betty. To find Tom's points, we subtract 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Martha's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 35 * 3 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by each student: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. To find the total number of people, we add the number of males and females: 8 + 6 = 14.

Next, we're told that each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by males, we multiply the number of males by the number of dumplings each male ate: 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by females and males to find the total number of dumplings eaten: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"Let's figure out how fast Martha's turtle can crawl. If her cat is 5 times faster than her turtle and the cat can run 15 feet per second, we need to find the turtle's speed.

Since the cat is 5 times faster, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to get the turtle's speed. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the local firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine how much they raise per hour. They've already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find the hourly rate, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they've already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, we need to find out what percentage of this 40% is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can calculate this by multiplying 40% by 0.8. 

0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%. This means 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge: 
14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of ice cream being produced: chocolate and vanilla.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, it would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's calculate Marcus' total bill. 

First, we need to find the cost of each item. 

The cost of 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply $50.00 by 0.10: 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Let's figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy. 

First, we need to know the cost of each scoop, which is $1.50. Erin has $6.00 to spend. 

To find out how many scoops she can buy, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy have after two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. To find out how much candy they eat in two weeks, we need to multiply the number of pieces they eat per day by 14 (the number of days in two weeks).

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's find out how much candy each of them has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hello there. I'm Anastasia, and I'm happy to help you with Mr. Boarden's bathroom remodeling project. To determine the number of mosaic tiles he needs, we first need to calculate the area he wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can find this by multiplying 36 by 2/3.

To do this, we can multiply 36 by 2 and then divide by 3. Multiplying 36 by 2 gives us 72, and dividing 72 by 3 gives us 24.

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. Now, we know that for every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate how much James saved by picking blueberries himself. 

First, we need to find the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking the blueberries is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost at the store would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The company initially planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each. However, they found out that the price of each computer is 10% higher than they had planned.

To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price. 10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70.

Now, we add this increase to the original price to get the new price: $700 + $70 = $770.

To find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers, we multiply the new price by the number of computers: 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"Let's break down the ingredients in John's omelet. He's using 6 eggs, 2 oz of cheese, and an equal amount of ham. 

First, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs. Since each egg is 75 calories, 6 eggs would be 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories from the cheese. With 2 oz of cheese at 120 calories per oz, that's 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Lastly, we calculate the calories from the ham. Since there's an equal amount of ham as cheese, that's also 2 oz. With 40 calories per oz, that's 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up the calories from all the ingredients: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the items you purchased. 

First, we need to find the cost of the pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50 and you bought 6 of them, the total cost of the pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, we need to find the cost of the erasers. Each eraser costs $0.25, and you bought 8 of them, so the total cost of the erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and erasers together to get the total cost: $3 + $2 = $5.

Since you paid $10 for the items, the change you would get is $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that 100 people apply for a job at Google. 

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:
30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:
A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave some to her cousin and brother. We know she gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

To find the total number of sacks she gave away, we simply add the sacks she gave to her cousin and brother. 

Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we need to multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

"Let's calculate how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week.

To do that, we need to find the total number of boxes she bought this week. Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so the total number of boxes she bought this week is 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of boxes she bought this week and last week. To do that, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

"The art of clog dancing is a beloved tradition in Slovenia, and Helga is indeed a master of the craft. Let's break down her tapping skills to determine the total number of times she taps both feet.

When Helga dances with her arms at her sides, she taps her right foot at a rate of 300 times per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 times per minute. This results in a combined total of 550 taps per minute. Over the course of 3 minutes, she would tap a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

However, when Helga raises her arms, her tapping speed slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. This means she taps a total of 400 times per minute. For the 2 minutes she dances with her arms raised, she would tap a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both feet, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"The pothole in front of Ron's house is a real nuisance. If it's not fixed, it's going to cause $450 worth of damage to his car. However, the city council is being stubborn and will fine Ron $120 if he decides to fix it himself. On top of that, he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.

To calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to add the fine and the cost of the asphalt. The fine is $120, and the cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, let's calculate how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. We subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"Let's calculate the number of chairs left in the restaurant. 

First, we need to find the total number of chairs sent for repair. There were 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs sent, so the total number of chairs sent for repair is 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, let's find the total number of chairs left. We have 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. If we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs, we get:

Total chairs left = 170 (normal chairs) + 23 (baby chairs) - 33 (chairs sent for repair)
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total, including Bryce and his 4 friends. 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. To find out how long it takes a dog to eat the same number of sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then divide by 2.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two groups of cars: students' cars and teachers' cars. We need to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we multiply the number of students' cars by the number of windows per car and then by 1/4.

Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows, we multiply the number of teachers' cars by the number of windows per car and then by 3/4.

Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars to find the overall total.

Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

"Let's calculate the percentage of blue spools of thread Candy has. To do this, we need to find the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

First, let's find the total number of blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. We have 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 

First, we need to find out how many people voted by midday. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 5000. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left after midday. 
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left after midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00. 
We subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the total number of people who were left after midday.
3000 - 2000 = 1000

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days: 4 * 30 = 120.

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack, which is 15. So, we calculate 120 / 15.

To find the result, we perform the division: 120 / 15 = 8.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"Let's figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need for the s'mores party. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so that's 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores for the kids. And 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, which is 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores for the adults. 

Now, let's add the s'mores for kids and adults together: 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 s'mores in total.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves. And since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 / 3 = 1 box.

So, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

"Let's break down the information given. Dora's age is 15 years. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. To find her father's age, we multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8.

Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. To find her age, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age.

Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, he makes 3 cubes, so that's 3 * 4 ounces = 12 ounces. For medium cubes, he makes 7 cubes, so that's 7 * 2 ounces = 14 ounces. For small cubes, he makes 8 cubes, and since each uses 1/2 an ounce, that's 8 * 0.5 ounces = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball.

Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, and 5 students like to play basketball, then 10 students like to play music.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. 
Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) 
= 50 - (10 + 5)

"Let's figure out how many birds are in the backyard now. Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, 1/3 of them flew away. To find out how many birds left, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12.

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds flew away. Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the total number of students in both classes is 80. Since each class has the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class. 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.

Next, we're told that in each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4): 40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class.

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the sequence of events. Mara initially had 2 slices of cake on the plate. Then, she added 3 more slices, bringing the total to 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, Mara tripled the number of slices she had, which is 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After that, she ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices from the plate, resulting in 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining.

The final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8."
"Hello there. I'm Anastasia, a pet groomer with a passion for making furry friends look and feel their best. This week, I have a busy schedule ahead of me. I need to bathe 8 dogs, clip the nails of 5 cats, trim the wings of 3 birds, and brush 12 horses. To make my work more manageable, I'll split these tasks evenly over the 7 days of the week.

First, I'll add up the total number of animals I need to groom: 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals.

Now, I'll divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many I'll groom each day: 28 / 7 = 4.

So, I'll be grooming 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark buys 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each. The total cost of the packs is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from the cards. Mark gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. He also gets 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each. The total value of these 30 cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total revenue is the sum of the value of all the cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"Let's break down the costs for each amusement park. 

For the first amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $26 = $52, and the cost for children is 2 * $12 = $24. Adding these together, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $14 = $28, and the cost for children is 2 * $10 = $20. Adding these together, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks: $76 - $48 = $28.

The final answer is: $28"
"Let's calculate the weekly savings for the tomato vendor.

First, we need to find out how much he saves per day by buying tomatoes from the new vendor. 

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each, but now he buys them at $0.4 each. 

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Now, we need to find out how much he saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily savings by 7.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given: Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's amount: 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find Carl's marbles, we multiply Sean's amount by 4: 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. We have a total of 54 students and we want to divide them into 6 groups. 

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are told that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students = 12 * 9
Total students = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, there are 8 weeks in two months. 

- Total chairs rented in 8 weeks: 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"Let's break down the events step by step. Gunther initially had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch. 

Arnold, the sneaky chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile. To find out how many bananas were left, we need to divide 48 by 2. 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile. Now, we need to add 25 to the previous total of 24 bananas. 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

However, Arnold was at it again, stealing 12 bananas from the pile. To find out how many bananas were left, we need to subtract 12 from 49. 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile. Now, we need to add 6 to the previous total of 37 bananas. 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, when Gunther began counting bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to divide the monthly bill by the number of roommates and then multiply the result by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the bill equally among themselves.

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Now, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to get the yearly amount:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. To find the total number of glasses and plates, we need to multiply the number of dozen by 12.

Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
- Broken glasses: 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that 11 students need size extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students. 

For size medium, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 students.

Moving on, half as many students need size large as size medium, which is 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Lastly, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

"Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases the second house needs as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Now, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

To reach his goal of $135, Bennet needs to make an additional $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Since he has 25 ears of corn, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear for. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the final price after a discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The laptop originally costs $1000, and there's a 20% discount. 

To find 20% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.20. 

$1000 * 0.20 = $200

This means the discount is $200. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you would have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.

"Let's break down Mike's movie collection replacement cost. He has 600 movies in total. A third of them are in series, which can be bought together for $6 each. To find the number of movies in series, we divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these series movies is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. To find the number of older movies, we multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The Llesis family drove and hiked to their vacation spot, and they spent a total of 6 hours doing so. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

To find their hiking speed, we need to determine half of their driving speed and then subtract 5 miles per hour from that. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, we'll find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ava and Emma are competing in a video game, and their scores are determined by the number of enemies they jump on, the number of berries they collect, and the time left on the timer when they finish the level.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so let's call the number of enemies Emma jumps on 'x'. Then, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so the number of berries Emma collects is 'y'. Then, Ava collects y + 3 berries.

The time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level is 60 seconds. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, the time left on the timer for Ava is 60 - 4 = 56 seconds.

Now, let's calculate their scores. Emma's score is the sum of the points she gets from enemies, berries, and the timer. Since she jumps on x enemies, collects y berries, and finishes the level in 60 seconds, her score is 10x + 5y + 30(60).

Ava's score is the sum of the points she gets from enemies, berries, and the timer. Since she jumps on x + 8 enemies, collects y + 3 berries, and finishes the level in 56 seconds, her score is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(56).

Now, let's simplify their scores. Emma's score is 10x + 5y + 1800. Ava's score is 10x + 80 + 5y + 1680.

To find the difference in their scores, we need to subtract Emma's score from Ava's score. The difference is (10x + 80 + 5y + 1680) - (10x + 5y + 1800).

Simplifying the expression, we get 80 + 1680 - 1800 = -40.

However, we can also consider the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores. The difference in their enemy scores is 8. The difference in their berry scores is 3. The difference in their timer scores is 60 - 56 = 4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas.

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Chase and Rider can ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. To find the total number of times they ride on these usual days, we multiply the number of times they ride per day by the number of days: 3 * 5 = 15.

However, there are two other days when they ride twice the times they do on usual days. Since they ride twice as many times on these days, we multiply the usual number of times they ride per day by 2: 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we need to find the total number of times they ride on these two extra days. Since there are two extra days, we multiply the number of times they ride per day on these days by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have Bob, who initially had 7 fish in his pond, consisting of 3 orange and 4 white fish. He then went to the pet store and had a sales assistant dip out 17 fish from a mixed tank. After adding these fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can solve the first equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he commutes to and from work every day, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we know he goes to work from Monday to Friday, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much fuel he consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so we can calculate the fuel consumption by dividing the total distance by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the fuel consumption by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt. 

First, we need to find the total value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the total value of the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply the number of twenties by the value of each twenty: 10 * $20 = $200.

Now, we know Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find the amount she spent, we multiply the total value of the twenties by 3/5: 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Finally, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"Let's calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants.

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes he can get. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and he planted 5 tomato plants, we multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant: 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants, so we multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant: 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

To find the number of smart TVs sold, we multiply one-fourth by the total number of TVs: 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.

To find the number of analog TVs sold, we multiply one-eighth by the total number of TVs: 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem. John is trying to raise money for a school trip that costs $300. The school has agreed to cover half of the cost. To find out how much the school will cover, we need to divide the total cost by 2:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

Since the school will cover $150, we need to find out how much John is missing. We know John already has $50. To find the amount he's missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing.

First, we need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'm excited to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 members, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we need to find out how many groups brought back seashells. It's given that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find this, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction that brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's calculate the number of people on the train. 

Initially, there were 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

The number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

To do this, we need to know how many bottle caps he finds per day and the value of each bottle cap. Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap:
10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Then, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"Let's break down Jamie's earnings for last Tuesday. She earns $20 per hour for her regular 8 hours of work. To find her earnings for these hours, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours worked: 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, Jamie is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. This means she earns 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour for the extra hours. To find her earnings for these hours, we multiply her special hourly rate by the number of hours worked: 3 * $30 = $90.

Now, we add her earnings from the regular hours and the extra hours to find her total earnings for the day: $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Hello there. I'm Anastasia, the zookeeper here at the local wildlife sanctuary. I'm delighted to help you with your question about the lion enclosure. 

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to count the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. We have 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. That's 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. 

As for the lion cubs, we have 14 adorable little ones. Now, let's add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

"Let's calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after buying the discounted jeans.

First, we need to find the discount amount. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much money he will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total salary for each month, we multiply the number of employees by the salary per employee:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. He was initially paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. 

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"Let's calculate the total number of trees planted at Ashley's school. 

First, we need to find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we need to find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class.

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is twice the total number of teachers.

Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

"I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to first find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

"Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week, which is 7 days. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

To find the total hours Kris has played, we add the hours from both periods: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Now, to find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars on the highway, with the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

First, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. So, for the first car:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

To find the distance between the two cars, we need to find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the ring. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the diamond and the gold. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. 

Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to add the 30% premium to this total. The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

To find the total cost with the premium, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the results of the standardized test from Herbert Hoover Elementary School. 

First, we need to find the number of students who passed in each grade. We know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. 

Now, let's find the number of fifth-graders who passed. The pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. 

First, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea drank to gallons by dividing by 4. However, we're actually looking for the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, which is the sum of the tea drank and the tea left. 

The amount of tea left is given as 10 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

To convert this to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. Then, he sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the initial number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

However, we can't have a negative number of candies, so this means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. Let's continue with the problem.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. To find the total number of candies he has now, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200

Now, we need to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy. We subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has.

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, let's find the number of additional students by subtracting the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem. Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he has to climb to retrieve items stuck in trees. He made a total of $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers. 

First, we have 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which gives us 3 * 5 = 15 petals. 

Next, we have 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which gives us 4 * 6 = 24 petals.

Then, we have 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which gives us 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

Lastly, we have 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which gives us 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have. First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

John and DeSean each make 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. They also drop 3 marshmallows, so in total, they use 21 marshmallows. To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract 21 from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used and dropped = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

Total marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four people playing games at the arcade: Jack and his three friends. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. Two of his friends are not as skilled and can only play for half the time, which is 10 minutes per quarter. The other friend is more skilled and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

They all play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Now, let's calculate the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 240 minutes. The two less skilled friends play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The more skilled friend plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the information given: Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money John spent at the market. 

To do this, we need to find the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 goats * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent a total of $4500 at the market."
"Let's calculate how many more cupcakes Paul should buy for the birthday party. 

To do this, we need to find out how many cupcakes he already has and subtract that from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so he has a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Since he needs 63 cupcakes in total, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes for the party.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Now, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe gives away 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

This means the students raised $125,000. Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. To find the time she walked on the second day, we need to divide the time she walked on the first day by 2.

Time walked on the first day: 8 hours
Time walked on the second day: 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Time walked on the first day in minutes: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
Time walked on the second day in minutes: 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to add the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

Total time = 480 + 240 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

"Let's break down John's daily earnings. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20.

To find his daily earnings, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Daily earnings = 30 cycles * 5 tasks * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = 150 tasks * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = $180

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings. Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's break down the information given about the basketball games between Sasha and Julie. 

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. We know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Now, let's consider the second game, which was at Julie's home court. Sasha struggles during away games, and we're told she scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

First, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles. 

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

Next, we need to find out how much Amazon will refund Milly for the book. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.

- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

"Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the month. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities. She records 18 videos per week, each taking 4 minutes. That's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes spent on recording videos.

She also spends 2 hours, or 120 minutes, writing songs for her TikTok content. And, she does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week, we add these times together: 72 minutes (videos) + 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) = 282 minutes.

Converting this to hours, we get 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours per week.

Now, let's calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

"Let's break down the installation costs for Angela. The interior design firm offers a base installation package for $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela needs to have 6 additional mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures installed. To calculate the cost of these additional items, we need to multiply the number of each item by the installation fee of $15.00 per item.

For the additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
For the additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
For the additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Now, let's add up the costs of the additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

To find the total cost, we need to add the base installation fee to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we need to find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain. Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain. Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down Mason's bike journey. He's traveling at a rate of 8 miles per hour. To find the total distance he's covered, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to divide the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

So, 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we're told that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they will take twice as long to travel across the highway. 

Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4. 

First, we multiply by 2 to account for the turtles' slower speed: 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours per turtle. 

Then, we multiply by 4 to account for the number of turtles: 12 hours * 4 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given: Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down Erika's situation. She's saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one will be reduced by $200, making it $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has already received some money from her part-time job, $150, and her mom has given her $80 to help out. So, the total amount of money she's received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can calculate the total amount of money she has by adding the price of the laptop after trading in her old one to the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, to find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially, we subtract the money she received from the total amount she has: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. He decides to slice 3 large apples and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will give him 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will give him 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the total number of slices together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so to find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

The milk production rate is 5 liters per cow per day. To find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's calculate the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. 

To find the unused portion of each glue stick, we need to calculate 1/6, 2/3, and 1/2 of 12 millimeters.

1/6 of 12 millimeters is 2 millimeters.
2/3 of 12 millimeters is 8 millimeters.
1/2 of 12 millimeters is 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Let's break down Gabriel's financial situation. He wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. To find out how much money he still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of these items.

The total cost of the items is $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. So, he has a total of $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

So, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"Let's calculate the change Thea got from the craftsman in Bali. 

First, we need to find the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. Since she gave him four $20 bills, we multiply 4 by $20. 

4 * $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"Let's calculate how much money Craig has left after his purchases.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

To find the total amount he spent, we add the cost of squirt guns and water balloons: $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them perform well in English only. The rest are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. Since the students good at both math and English are counted in both groups, we need to add them to the students good at math only.

First, let's find the number of students good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students good at math only and those good at both math and English.

Total students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

"I'm Anastasia, and I'm here to help you with Vicki's pop concert planning. Let's break down the time needed for each group to perform. Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. That's a total of 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. However, there's a 10-minute intermission, so we need to subtract that from the total time. That leaves us with 120 - 10 = 110 minutes for performances.

Now, let's divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, the answer is that 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"Let's break down the information given. We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, which means 20 of them do. To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. We know that 20 of them have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This is simply 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's calculate how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

Number of trays = 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm X. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.

Next, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. It's mentioned that he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. In Farm X, he had 55 goats initially and sold 10, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

In Farm Y, he had 45 goats initially and sold 20, so the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y. So, the total number of goats left is 45 + 25 = 70.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of baskets: green food baskets that cost $25 each and red food baskets that cost $18 each. We're buying 3 baskets of each type.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 green food baskets: 3 * $25 = $75. Then, we calculate the cost of 3 red food baskets: 3 * $18 = $54.

Now, we add the costs of both types of baskets together: $75 + $54 = $129. However, we also get a discount of $2 for each red food basket. Since we bought 3 red food baskets, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we'll calculate one-half of that.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The town plans to build homes over the next three years. In the first year, they will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. To find this, we multiply 12 by 3, which equals 36 homes.

Now, let's calculate the number of homes built in the third year. They will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we add the number of homes built in the first two years: 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, we double this amount: 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the following information:

- I am three years younger than my brother, so my age is x, and my brother's age is x + 3.
- I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

"Let's calculate how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy for his class.

First, we need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. There are 27 students in the class, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. 

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

Number of glue sticks per pack: 8
Number of packs required: 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through a river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, which means it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the new total, we add this increase to the amount of water on the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point. To do this, we add the initial amount of water (4000 gallons) to the amount of water on the second day (8000 gallons) and the amount of water on the third day (14000 gallons): 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a plague that infects people, and each infected person infects six others every day. We want to find out how many people are infected after three days, starting with ten people.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount: 40 * $20 = $800.

Now, we know that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1: 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total: $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of money they received as tips, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together: $800 + $720 = $1520.

"Let's break down the information given:

Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so she earns half the amount of badges Claire does in the same time frame. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour, and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. So, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the price per slice to dollars by dividing 50 by 100, which equals 0.5 dollars per slice.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars

However, I made a slight mistake in my calculation. Let me redo it.

80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins.

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

"Let's break down the information given about the bumper car rink. We know they have 12 red cars. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the rink has 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Next, we're told the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has a total of 75 cars, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the overall total: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We can express Sofie's books in terms of Anne's books: S = A + 25.

We can also express Anne's books in terms of Fawn's books: A = F - 12.

Now, let's substitute the expression for S into the equation for the total number of books: (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Now, substitute the expression for A into this equation: 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85.

Expand the equation: 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

Now, we know the seller gave $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will receive $500 in change."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Madeline and her roommate, Keenan, share the cost of groceries, which amounts to $400 per month. We need to find out how much Keenan spends per week.

First, we need to determine how much Keenan pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. To find 40% of $400, we multiply 0.4 by 400.

0.4 x 400 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we'll divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"Let's break down Tobias's pizza-eating adventure. He started with a big pizza that had 60 pieces. On the first day, he devoured 2/5 of those pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

So, on the first day, Tobias ate 24 pieces. On the second day, he ate 10 more pieces. 

Now, let's calculate how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces so far.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so to find the cost of 1 bottle of soda, we'll divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Similarly, 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so to find the cost of 1 bottle of water, we'll divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"Let's calculate how much money David has left after buying the bolts.

To do this, we need to find the total cost of the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03 and David wants to buy 16 bolts, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, we subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts."

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

However, we are asked for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000. 

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together by subtracting Julie's sales from the total.

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie = 32 - 14 = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses each of them sold by dividing the total number of glasses they sold by 2.

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 18
Number of people selling glasses = 2
Glasses sold by each of them = Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 9
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 9 = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

Solving for x, we get x = 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down Kelly's shopping cart. She has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. 

The 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, so that's 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.

The 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so that's 3 * $4 = $12.

The 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $2 each, so that's 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final answer is: $-91"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. The final concert's runtime is 2x minutes, and the encore is 15 minutes. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. To find the total number of chimichangas made on these two days, we simply add them together.

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) = 250

Now, we're told that they make twice as many chimichangas on Friday as they do on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. Since they make 250 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, we multiply this number by 2 to find the number of chimichangas made on Friday.

250 * 2 = 500

Now, to find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday to the number made on Friday.

250 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 500 (Friday) = 750

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in. This means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs.

To find the number of microphones that will be arranged in pairs, we need to calculate 80% of 50. 

80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we need to divide the total number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's count the birds together. Jerry sees six birds nesting in the bushes. Then, he notices that 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2 * 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's solve this problem together. Lani baked 55 cookies and then ate 5 of them. To find out how many cookies were left, we need to subtract the cookies she ate from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now, we know Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to divide the cookies left by the number of jars.

Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Since Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, we'll find the total number of petals on the daisies. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, so we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. 

First, we find the number of indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Next, we find the number of outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. She buys two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means it costs $3.

To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to know the total cost of her daily goods, which is $11. We can represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since she buys two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Let's calculate Mark's weekly earnings. 

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find out his total hours worked in a week, we multiply the hours he works in a day by the number of days he works in a week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Mark's pay was raised by $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to isolate it in the equation. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the information given. Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"Let's break down John's car rental business. He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. To find out how much he earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Martha initially had some notebooks, and then she bought 5 more, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. To find out how many notebooks Martha had initially, we subtract the number of notebooks she bought from the total number of notebooks she now has: 7 - 5 = 2.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Hello there. I'm Anastasia, and I'm happy to help you with your question. 

So, Dijana and Anis went out rowing on a Sunday morning, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find the total distance rowed by both of them, we need to calculate the distance rowed by Anis.

To do that, we need to find 1/5 of 50 miles. 1/5 of 50 is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances together. 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"Let's figure out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get. First, we need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. Susan started with 100 cookies, and her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. 

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we only need to consider his yesterday's reading.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. To find out how many pages Denise read today, we add 5 to Daniel's yesterday's reading: 13 + 5 = 18 pages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each of them read. Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so her total is 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so his total is 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem. Calvin is making soup for his family, and he has a pot that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children will be eating dinner, that's a total of 4 people. 

Since each person eats one bowl, they will use 4 bowls in total. Now, we need to figure out how many child bowls that is equivalent to. Since 4 adult bowls is equal to 8 child bowls, 4 bowls is equal to 4 child bowls.

Now, we know that there are 4 child bowls used for dinner, and the pot can fill 8 child bowls. To find out how many child bowls are left, we subtract the number of child bowls used from the total number of child bowls the pot can fill: 8 - 4 = 4.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 4 child bowls left, we can divide the number of child bowls left by the number of children to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 4 / 2 = 2.

"Let's calculate the material needed for Jo to make face masks for her class.

To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Material per small mask = 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask
- Material needed for 20 small masks = 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards

For large masks: 
- Material per large mask = 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask
- Material needed for 8 large masks = 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards

Total material needed = Material for small masks + Material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Let's break down Harold's daily activities. He sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a good amount of rest. 

Harold also works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

In addition to sleeping and working, Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day. 

To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends on these activities. There are 24 hours in a day.

Total hours spent = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours

Now, let's calculate Harold's free time:
Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the problem. Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of his red shoeboxes to go fishing.

To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to add the marbles he gave away: 6 + 10 = 16. 

Now, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total: 30 - 16 = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
So, (60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

"Let's break down Colby's earnings for a typical eight-hour workday. 

First, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works: 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 * $0.20 = $64.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that 20 of the balloons were red.

First, let's calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since there are 20 red balloons and Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each one, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 3 * y.

We know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's calculate how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month. 

To do this, we need to find out how many miles he drives in that time. Since he drives 100 miles a day, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days.

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many tune-ups his car needs. Since a tune-up is required every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. 

The cake costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons are sold in sets of 2 for $0.5, we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons they bought. To do this, we divide 12 by 2, which equals 6. Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 6 * $0.5 = $3. 

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items they bought: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"Let's count Larry's pets. He has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Now, let's calculate the number of rabbits. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Next, we'll figure out how many fish he has. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Moving on to the gerbils, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Let's calculate how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday. 

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"The mystery of the tea cups. Let's get to the bottom of it. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total, and she divides them into 3 rows. To find out how many cups are in each row, we simply divide 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Now, since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we need to find out how many of those are mint tea cups. If we divide the 9 cups in each row by 2, we get 4.5. However, we can't have half a cup of tea, so we need to consider the whole numbers.

Let's assume there are 4 mint tea cups in each row. That would mean there are 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. But we know that Lana brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea using the remaining cups. Since 12 mint tea cups are already accounted for, the remaining cups must be used for cinnamon tea.

However, if we assume there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, that would mean there are 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. This is a problem, as we know there are only 12 cups of mint tea in total (27 - 15 = 12). So, this option is not possible.

But, if we assume there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, and 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, then the total number of mint tea cups would be 12, and the remaining 3 cups would be used for cinnamon tea. This is a possibility.

However, if we assume there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, and 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, then the total number of mint tea cups would be 15, which is not possible since there are only 12 cups of mint tea in total.

So, the correct answer is that there are 4 mint tea cups in each row.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, let's consider the tank's water usage. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water used in 6 days, we multiply the daily rate by the number of days: 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To determine the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"Let's break down Colby's expenses for the month. He's already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each) and 8 movies on other days ($7 each), 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each), and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each).

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movies: 5 * $10 = $50 for Friday and Saturday movies, and 8 * $7 = $56 for other days. The total spent on movies is $50 + $56 = $106.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on snacks: 2 * $8 = $16 for popcorn and 4 * $2 = $8 for candy. The total spent on snacks is $16 + $8 = $24.

Now, let's add the total spent on movies and snacks: $106 + $24 = $130.

Colby's monthly budget is $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to see a movie on a Friday and also buy popcorn and candy, he'll spend $10 for the movie, $8 for popcorn, and $2 for candy, which is a total of $20. This leaves him with $0.

However, he can still use the $20 to see a movie on a different day. The cost of a movie on a different day is $7, so he can see $20 / $7 = 2.857 (round down to 2 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movies on other days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked.

First, we need to find the calories of each type of mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we'll calculate the calories from the blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, we add the calories from both types of pastries to find the total calories: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"Let's calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it covers a distance of 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car, on the other hand, travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, which means it covers a distance of 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's figure out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought for her nephew. We know she had a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks, a bin of stuffed animals with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower of stacking rings with 9 multicolored rings. 

To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we need to know the total number of toys she had before buying the bouncy balls. We can find this by adding the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings together.

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

We also know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie had a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J. 

We can start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than Jean. This can be written as Pp = J + 10.

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, which can be written as P = Pp + J.

Now, we can use the fact that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This can be written as P + Pp + J = 100.

We can substitute Pp with J + 10 in the equation P + Pp + J = 100:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Since Pp = J + 10, we can substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's count the water balloons. Maria started with 1 balloon for herself. Her 4 friends each had 2 balloons, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. In total, they had 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each of them 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, that's 5 * 3 = 15 more balloons. Now, let's add the initial balloons to the additional ones: 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"The watermelon seed spitting contest between Zoey and Sydney is quite the event. To determine the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's add their total distances together: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average, we need to know the total number of seeds spat. Zoey spat 40 seeds and Sydney spat 35 seeds, so the total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Now, we can calculate the average total distance spat: 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and it runs 24 hours a day for 30 days. So, the total number of widgets it can produce is:

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, and it also runs 24 hours a day for 30 days. So, the total number of widgets it can produce is:

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron can also choose to pay 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after that.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he needs to pay for the initial 12 hours and 5 additional hours. The cost of the additional hours is 70 * 5 = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to compare this cost to the cost of the 24-hour option. The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the savings: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to determine how much hay each sheep needs. Since each goat requires 5 pounds of hay, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs by finding twice the amount each goat needs and then subtracting 3 pounds.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he'll be left with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars. Now, let's consider the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and he wants to buy 5 of them, which will cost 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

After buying the pencils, John will have 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. Now, let's see how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with this amount. To do this, we divide 100 by 25, which gives us 4.

So, John can buy 4 pens with the money he has left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words he spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children in one school and then multiply it by the number of schools.

There are 8 children in each row and 7 rows. So, the total number of children in one school is 8 * 7 = 56.

Now, we have 5 different schools, so we multiply the total number of children in one school by the number of schools: 56 * 5 = 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. To find the total number of bottles given to the students, we multiply the number of pupils by the number of bottles each student gets: 29 * 2 = 58.

Now, let's look at the teacher's coupons. She has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles she gets, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon can redeem: 9 * 100 = 900.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, Patty worked 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

Next, we need to add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down James' situation. He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the original price is 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got them for 40% off, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. After the discount, he paid $150 - $60 = $90.

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent. So, he was out $90 - $200 = -$110. The negative sign indicates a loss.

The final answer is: -$110"
"Let's calculate the total earnings from Jen's root crops. 

First, we need to find out how much she earns from the yams. Since she has 6 yams and each yam can be sold at $1.5, the total earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, and each one costs $2. So, the total earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we'll determine the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots, and each carrot costs $1.25. Therefore, the total earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do this, we'll calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. To find out how many loaves the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves the bakery has. It's mentioned that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So, we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left, we need to subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she was given initially. 

15 (initial stickers) - 7 (lost stickers) = 8

After losing some stickers, Jasmine received 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find out the total number of stickers she has now, we need to add the stickers she received to the stickers she already had.

8 (remaining stickers) + 5 (new stickers) = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling newspapers.

First, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times. The number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, we need to calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to find the total commission.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this to A - D = -10. 

Now, we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + (D - 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"Let's break down Kim's sleep schedule. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. To find her usual sleep time in minutes, we multiply the hours by 60. So, 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, which means she woke up at 5:55 a.m. We need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., we can calculate the time she went to sleep by adding the sleepwalking time to her wake-up time. 2:38 a.m. + 5 minutes (earlier wake-up) = 2:43 a.m. Then, we add the 5 minutes to get her usual bedtime: 2:43 a.m. + 5 minutes = 2:48 a.m. However, since she went to sleep at 10 p.m. that day, we need to find the time difference between 10 p.m. and 2:48 a.m. 

10 p.m. to 2:48 a.m. is 4 hours and 48 minutes. We convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes, and 48 minutes remains the same. So, the total time is 240 + 48 = 288 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking (23 minutes) from her total sleep time (288 minutes): 288 - 23 = 265 minutes.

The final answer is: 265"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can find the number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. 

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and spoons together.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract this from the total capacity:

1000 - 200 = 800

Now, we need to account for the patients admitted due to the coronavirus outbreak. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this by the number of days in 2 weeks (14):

50 * 14 = 700

These patients will occupy the hospital beds, so we add this to the initial number of occupied beds:

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down Robyn's emails. She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many non-work emails she sends, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1 * 3) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We add the number of balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7.

"The pirate crew's treasure hunt is quite the adventure. Let's break it down step by step. They started by digging 10 holes on the first day. The next day, they dug 13 more holes, bringing the total to 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 more holes but had to fill in 2 holes they kept falling into. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

Now, we know the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's solve this problem together. We know that Amora and Lainey got an equal amount of corn chips, and Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others. We're also given that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add up the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. We can do this by adding 70 + 70 + 85.

70 + 70 = 140
140 + 85 = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's dive into the world of Pokémon and figure out how many Pokémon Stan has caught.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokémon. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We can start by setting up an equation based on the total number of Pokémon caught: A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can express this as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, we know that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe, which can be written as S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms, we get 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find that A = 40.

Now that we know the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe, we can find the number caught by Stan: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's dive into the problem. We know that each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since there are 20 minutes per episode, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"The bird's journey to her winter home in the south is quite an adventure. To find the distance between her northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled in the first 10 hours. She flew at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered is 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flew towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. This means she traveled 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles in the opposite direction.

Finally, the bird changed direction and flew towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. This distance is 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, let's find the net distance between the two homes by subtracting the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. The net distance is 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"Let's break down Greta's brownie adventure. She started with a dozen cream cheese swirl brownies she made for herself, which is 12 brownies. Then, her office sent her home with half a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. And, to make her birthday even more special, her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

But, it's not all good news. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were devoured, which is 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta has left, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

So, Greta has 48 brownies left over from her birthday celebration.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given. Nani is 8 years old, and his brother is twice his age. So, his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Now, let's find Nani's sister's age. She is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes.

Then, we'll calculate the time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the times together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"Let's break down the cost of the phones. The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining two phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost for all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of players in both teams. To do this, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed for the fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she has left. She had 240 oranges initially and gave away 80, so she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Next, we need to find the number of states in India. It's mentioned that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29. 

So, India has 29 states.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we simply add the number of states in the USA and India. That's 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the books. We do this by adding the cost of each book together: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining amount. We know that he earns $5 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we need to subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries together, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given for Sunny's fundraiser.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 15 boxes. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the price of the blue car is $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of $100. To do this, we multiply $100 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 0.4). This gives us $40.

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car: $100 - $40 = $60. So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the blue and red cars together: $100 + $60 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. 

From the information, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From this, we can also deduce that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. So, 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down Joe's crawfish catch. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by multiplying 0.2 by the total number of students, which is 30.

0.2 * 30 = 6 students are football players.

Now, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Since these students are part of the remaining class after removing the football players, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students.

30 - 6 = 24 students are remaining.

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining 24 students to determine the number of cheerleaders or band members.

0.25 * 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or band members.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant takes up 12 inches of space plus 18 inches of space between plants. 

To make calculations easier, let's convert the length of the flower bed to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total space taken up by the plants and the space between them. The total space taken up by each plant and the space between it and the next plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches. 

We can set up an equation to find the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed: 12n = 1332 - 30n, where 'n' is the number of plants. To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1332. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1332 / 42 = 31.7143. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

However, we need to remember that Pat already owns 17 flowers. So, she needs to buy 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers. Each flower costs $6 at the store, so the total cost will be 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"Let's figure out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. 

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18.

"Let's calculate the total cost for Katherine to fill her hanging baskets. 

First, we need to find the cost of the petunias. Since she has 5 baskets and each basket requires 3 petunias, the total number of petunias needed is 5 * 3 = 15. The cost of each petunia is $3.00, so the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of the sweet potato vines. Since she has 5 baskets and each basket requires 2 vines, the total number of vines needed is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of each vine is $2.50, so the total cost of vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of petunias and vines to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's calculate how many roses Artemis and her father can plant. They have a 30-pound bag of soil. 

First, we need to find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations. They plant 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, they plant 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have 30 pounds of soil in total, so the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down Jessica's situation. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. To find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

Now, let's add the cooling effects together: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

To find the net cooling effect, we subtract the warming effect from the total cooling effect: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age at the time of the second sighting.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. This means that 75 years have passed between the two sightings.

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that 75 years have passed between the two sightings, and Bill was 15 years old when his dad saw the comet for the second time. 

To find Bill's age at the first sighting, we need to subtract 75 from 15. 

15 - 75 = -60

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill's dad was 15 years old when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let x be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

x + 75 = 30

To solve for x, we need to subtract 75 from both sides of the equation.

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill's dad was 15 years old when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let x be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

x + 75 = 30

To solve for x, we need to subtract 75 from both sides of the equation.

x = 30 - 75
x = -45

"Let's break down Buford's check-writing habits. He writes a check every month for his electric bill, which means he writes 12 checks for that each year. He also writes a check every month for his gas bill, adding another 12 checks. Additionally, he writes two checks to the church every month, resulting in 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months, which translates to 4 checks annually.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add these numbers together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by doubling the number of flights made by the second plane. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply the total number of flights made by the first plane by three-quarters. This gives us (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights made by the first plane and then divide the result by 2. This gives us (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11 flights to France.

The final answer is: 11"
"The three little wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous, are quite the musical trio. When they howl at the moon, it's a symphony of sound. Let's calculate the combined length of their howls.

Tobias, the first wolf, howls for 20 seconds. Chikote, being the melodious one, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. And Igneous, the harmonious one, howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so that's 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the individual howling times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 to help with the purchase. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers. That would be $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7. Since the total age of the children is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred by subtracting the age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13.

Now, let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10. We already know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, so we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age: 13 - 10 = 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Walter starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. 

The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by Walter's friend. 

So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is $2000. 

To find the amount the lawyer will donate, we multiply $2000 by 3. 

$2000 * 3 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were 100 guests at the wedding reception, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought: 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for their help. To find half of the total number of cookies, we multiply the total by 1/2: 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received: 750 / 15 = 50.

"Let's dive into the problem. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They want to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To solve this, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 100. Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"Let's break down the time it takes to make the cake. Jordan needs to make the cake batter, which takes 20 minutes. Then, she has to bake the cake, which takes 30 minutes. After that, the cake needs to cool for 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Finally, she needs to frost the cake, which takes an additional 10 minutes.

To find the total time required, we add these times together: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"Let's break down the problem. Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter and Martha have the same number of chocolate bars in each box, but the total number of chocolate bars they have is different.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"Let's calculate the number of female porcupines in the park. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can find it by multiplying the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. With 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School.

First, we know that the school has a total of 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. 

Now, let's find out how many of these students are male. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this by dividing 1500 by 4, which gives us 375 male students over 16.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can find this by dividing 1500 by 2, resulting in 750 male students under 16.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Finally, to find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After that, it started losing 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after 8 hours. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, so the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is indeed 28%.

Now, let's find the initial charge. We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 28% = 27%. So, the initial charge is 55% + 27% = 82%.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. We also know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%. But we also know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. This means that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is indeed 6%.

Now, let's find the initial charge. We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 28% = 27%. However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

"Let's break down Janet's situation. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply 0.2 by $10,000, which equals $2000.

Now, we need to determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy with the money he has left.

First, we need to find out how much money Jamaar has left after buying the other fruits. 

The cost of the fruits he has already purchased is:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces each friend received. Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. 1.3 packs can be broken down into 1 pack and 0.3 packs. 

1 pack has 60 pieces, and 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and divided them equally among 8 albums. Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, let's find the number of selfies. Since 3 albums were selfies only, we multiply the number of selfies albums by the number of pictures per album.

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together.

Portraits and selfies: 27 + 27 = 54

"Let's break down the situation at the hotel. Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so we subtract those as well: 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. We add these new guests to the remaining count: 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a 60-item quiz, and 40% of the questions are easy. To find out how many easy questions there are, we multiply 60 by 0.4.

60 * 0.4 = 24

So, there are 24 easy questions. The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, which means there are 36 questions left. We can divide this number by 2 to find out how many average and difficult questions there are.

36 / 2 = 18

There are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get. She's sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She's also sure to get 50% of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 for each.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions, 9 average questions, and 9 difficult questions.

To find the total number of questions she's sure to get, we add these numbers together:

18 + 9 + 9 = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's calculate the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. To find the total number of sandwiches they eat per day, we need to add these amounts together: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we need to multiply the total number of sandwiches they eat per day by the number of days in a week, which is 7. So, 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, which gives her a total of 80 * $1 = $80. 

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, which gives her a total of 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne also gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's solve this problem together. We know that the Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.

To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. With his bare hands, he can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much more ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe. 50% more than 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. We multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three different package sizes for sandwiches: 2 sandwiches for $3, 4 sandwiches for $6, and 8 sandwiches with an unknown price.

First, we need to find the price per sandwich for the first two packages. For the first package, the price per sandwich is $3 divided by 2 sandwiches, which equals $1.5 per sandwich. 

For the second package, the price per sandwich is $6 divided by 4 sandwiches, which also equals $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. Now, we can find the price for the third package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He then sells his old bedroom for $1000, which he uses to pay for part of the bedroom set. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, so we need to calculate 10% of the amount still owed.

Amount still owed: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the situation with Sally and her balloons. 

First, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Then, a gust of wind burst 40% of the red balloons. To find out how many red balloons burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. That's a total of 34 balloons."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, the total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, which is not possible. This means we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get -2%. However, we can't have a negative probability, so we need to add 100% to -2% to get 98%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. 

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question implies that the remaining tickets are for guests. 

Therefore, the answer is 5 tickets per graduate."
"Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.

Let's start by finding out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, let's figure out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. 

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150 (since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean). 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down Melissa's jury duty pay. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. To find out her total earnings, we multiply her daily pay by the number of days: 3 days * $15 per day = $45.

However, she also has to pay $3 for parking each day. So, her total expenses would be 3 days * $3 per day = $9. 

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since she works 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked would be 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly pay after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: 
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down Ted's purchases. He bought 3 books for $16 each, so the total cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars. He also bought 3 pencils for $6 each, so the total cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet along his 24-foot-wide driveway. To find the total number of bottles, we need to divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Now, we know it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next. To find the total time, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many packs Uncle Franky can make with the apples. He has two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's calculate how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese.

The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds, so the cost is 2 * $11 = $22.
The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds, so the cost is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break down Jim's situation. He took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, which totals to $200,000 in loans. Additionally, he lost $25,000 per year for 4 years due to not working while in college, which amounts to $100,000.

So, Jim needs to earn a total of $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples to $75,000 per year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Monday. The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

Next, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which equals 85. Then, we add 17 to that result, giving us 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

Now, let's move on to Wednesday. They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2, which equals 204. Then, we add 5 to that result, giving us 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"Let's calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering. 

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken salad. Since 10 people want it and it costs $6.50 per person, the total cost of the chicken salad is 10 * $6.50 = $65.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pasta salad. Since 6 people want it and it costs $6 per person, the total cost of the pasta salad is 6 * $6 = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to get the total amount Molly will pay for the catering. $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities. 

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Since the whole population lives in these cities, we can start by finding the total number of cities: 26 countries * 5 cities per country = 130 cities.

Now, we know that each city has 1000 people. To find the total population, we multiply the total number of cities by the population of each city: 130 cities * 1000 people per city = 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130000"
"Let's calculate the current heights of Cole and Xavier. Xavier was initially 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 48 inches. He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole was initially 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, making his current height 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, let's find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier. To do this, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

Now, let's add up the shares of all three people: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + x + 80 + 80 + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 3x + 320 = 1920.

Subtract 320 from both sides: 3x = 1600.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 533.33.

The final answer is: $533.33"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory retrieved a certain number of tennis balls in the second set, which we'll call x. In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls, and in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is x / 2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, and it's given that this total is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To simplify the equation, let's first get rid of the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's distribute the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"Let's break down the information given. We have a total of 50 books in the library. Half of them are written in English, which means there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

Now, let's find out how many books are written in German. 10% of the books are written in German, so we multiply 50 by 0.1 to get the number of German books: 50 * 0.1 = 5.

Now that we know the number of English and German books, we can find the number of Spanish books. We subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, making the total 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

Finally, at the third stop, 80 more people get off the train. To find the total number of people left, we subtract 80 from 190: 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"Let's break down the costs of the athletic gear Alison bought.

First, the tank top costs $10. Then, the running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, which is $10 + $5 = $15.

The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 / 2 = $24.

Next, the athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we subtract the coupon value from the original price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of renovating your kitchen floor.

To find the total cost, we need to determine the number of tiles required to cover the floor. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Given that the total area of your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need to find the total number of tiles required. Since each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's calculate James' insurance cost. Since he had an accident, his insurance cost is 60% more than the normal cost. The normal cost is $120 a month.

To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

"Let's break down Greg's laundry needs. He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 

For the twin beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets. 
For the king size bed, he needs 1 king sheet. 
So, in total, he needs 8 + 1 = 9 sheets per week.

Now, let's consider the laundry machine's capacity. It can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time. 
For the twin sheets, he can wash 4 / 2 = 2 sets per week. 
For the king sheet, he can wash 1 set per week. 
So, in total, he can wash 2 + 1 = 3 sets per week.

Since each set requires 1 load, he does 3 loads per week. 
There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 * 52 = 156 loads per year.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, let's multiply the amount each cat eats per day by the number of cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams per day.

To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

"Let's break down the costs of Hannah's doctor's visit.

First, there's the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Hannah also needs to pay for painkillers. She needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, there's the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour, and the minimum parking time is 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

"Let's break down James' email situation. He receives 80 emails a day, but 20% of those don't require a response. To find out how many emails he doesn't respond to, we need to calculate 20% of 80.

20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. These are the emails James doesn't respond to.

Now, let's find out how many emails he does respond to. Since he doesn't respond to 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5.

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

Now, let's move on to the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many he ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

First, we need to find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so we calculate this by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4.

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we need to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers. This is the total number of trucks minus the number of trucks with mechanical failures.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons per truck.

Total tons of fertiliser = 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants, and the butter costs $4.00 a pound. There's a promotion where he can buy one pound of butter and get one half off.

To take advantage of the promotion, Dennis will buy 6 pounds of butter in sets of 2 pounds. For each set, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

The cost for one set of 2 pounds of butter is $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half off) = $6.00. Since Dennis needs 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"Let's break down the party costs for Kayla. We need to find the total number of guests attending the party and then calculate the additional cost.

First, let's find the total number of guests invited. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so we need to subtract those from the total number of guests. 45 - 4 = 41 guests will be attending the party.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so the cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, let's add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests. The initial fee is $125, so the total cost is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can infer that the amount they spent is the difference between their initial and final amounts.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. This implies that the amount she spent is 1/4 of her initial amount. Let's call her initial amount 'x'. Then, 1/4 * x = $60. Solving for x, we get x = $240.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. This implies that the amount she spent is 1/3 of her initial amount. Let's call her initial amount 'y'. Then, 1/3 * y = $60. Solving for y, we get y = $180.

Now that we know their initial amounts, we can find the total amount of money they had initially: $240 + $180 = $420.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys, and they last for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total number of bananas eaten each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's consider the eating habits of the monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenny wants to buy 15 roses from the florist. Roses cost $2 each, but the florist offers a deal where a dozen roses cost $15. Since 15 roses is 1 dozen and 3 individual roses, it's more cost-effective to buy 1 dozen roses and 3 individual roses.

The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

9 burger platters for $11 each will be 9 x $11 = $99
20 sodas for $1.50 each will be 20 x $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total amount from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long Paul will wait for his train.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes. It will stay in the station for 20 minutes, so it will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train will leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Melanie has been saving toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, which is $2000. To find the price he paid, we multiply the original price by 0.75:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Now, he sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. To find the price his friend paid, we multiply the price Mr. Rogers paid by 1.2:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours. 

First, we need to find the total number of seconds in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"Let's figure out Frankie's bowling score. We know Binkie's score is 90. To find Frankie's score, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to add 15 to this number to find Frankie's score. 

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"Let's break down James' journey. He walked to the store, which is 4 miles away, and then he walked back home. Since he walked halfway to the store before turning back, he walked a total of 4 miles to the halfway point and 4 miles back home, making the total distance 8 miles.

To find the time it took him to walk 8 miles, we need to divide the total distance by his speed. James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. 

8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, we multiply the number of bunches by the price per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They decide to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

Let's calculate the growth rate by dividing the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, we need to find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so we multiply 300 by 0.15 to get 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. So, 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer is making hay bales at a rate of 5 bales per hour, and the truck is picking up the bales at a rate of 3 bales per hour. Both the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer. Since the farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he dedicates on the weekends.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per period by the number of periods and the number of days.

6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends in his extra classes. He has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, and he attends these classes 5 days a week.

2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

John also dedicates extra time to learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his total weekly minutes on these days. To find his total weekly minutes, we multiply the minutes in a day by the number of days in a week.

7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

The final answer is: 30.17"
"Let's calculate the height of the bouncy ball after each bounce.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

After the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the heights of Caroline's children step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's calculate the total earnings of the apple orchard. To do this, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's solve this puzzle together. We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had, we can calculate the velociraptors' share. To do this, we multiply 270 by 2, which gives us 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. To find the T-Rex's share, we multiply 540 by 2, which equals 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must be double the T-Rex's share. Therefore, we multiply 1080 by 2 to get the original weight of the triceratops.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Then, her brother came along and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time. The first train has traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train has traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Now, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them. 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of days Billy helps between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were 12 buses and 20 private cars parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, as there is no other information provided.

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. To find Martha's age, we subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"Let's break down Bobby's daily schedule. He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, we need to calculate the total time spent on breaks. Since he takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, the total break time is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the lunch time to the break time. The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply the miles Amber ran by 3.5, since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions step by step.

First, Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge.

$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the frying pan.

$20.00 (original price) - $4.00 (discount) = $16.00

Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the towels.

$30.00 (original price) - $3.00 (discount) = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels.

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance to get the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

$70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jellyfish tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"Let's break down Lauren's retirement savings plan. She's saving 20% of her $100,000 annual salary, which translates to $20,000 in annual savings.

To determine how much she needs to save for retirement, we need to calculate her annual living expenses during that time. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her annual retirement income will be 40% of $100,000, which is $40,000.

Given that she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is her annual retirement income multiplied by the number of years in retirement: $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Now, each of those 4 parts needs to be cut into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final cuts, we'll divide the length of the initial parts by 5.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, let's divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

"Soledad is planning a hiking trip in June, and she's determined to cover 9,300 miles. Since she'll be hiking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, we need to figure out how many miles she'll hike in total per day. That's 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it'll take her to complete her journey, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days. However, June only has 30 days, so she won't be able to finish her trip on time.

Let's calculate how many miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles. The difference between her goal and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given about Tate's garden pond. There are initially 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

First, let's calculate the total number of male guppies. We add the initial number of male guppies to the number of male guppies Tate bought: 4 + 2 = 6.

Next, we calculate the total number of female guppies by adding the initial number of female guppies to the number of female guppies Tate bought: 7 + 1 = 8.

Now, let's find the total number of male goldfishes by adding the initial number of male goldfishes to the number of male goldfishes Tate bought: 3 + 2 = 5.

Then, we calculate the total number of female goldfishes by adding the initial number of female goldfishes to the number of female goldfishes Tate bought: 5 + 3 = 8.

To find the total number of male fishes, we add the total number of male guppies and male goldfishes: 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the total number of female fishes, we add the total number of female guppies and female goldfishes: 8 + 8 = 16.

Finally, to find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the chores and the time each person took to complete them. Amalia was in charge of mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

Megan had to walk the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. So, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's task was to do laundry, and it took her 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete it. Therefore, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to add up the time taken by each person. So, the total time is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"Hello there. Let's break down John's monthly driving distance to visit his parents. 

First, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip. To do this, we multiply his speed by the time it takes to get there. 

Speed = 70 mph
Time = 2 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, we know John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance he drives in a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"Let's break down the problem. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. To find out how far she'll walk in total, we multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. To find Brian's total distance, we divide Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 400 toys to produce, and 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift.

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. The other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours. This is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding the weights of both of his dogs.

15 + 30 = 45 pounds

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog.

45 + 60 = 105 pounds

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. So, Luis had 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.
2. Luis had 14 stickers, which is half of what Seth had. So, Seth had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's calculate the number of small bags John can make. He buys 3 large bags of M&M's, each weighing 10 ounces. To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this distance, we divide the circumference by 2.

40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to find its speed.

The 2nd fastest car's speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the speed of the faster car. We're told that it's 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find its speed, we multiply 600 by 1.25.

The faster car's speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's figure out how old Vince is. We know Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age was 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can calculate Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age two years ago by 2. 

Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 easter eggs. 

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A and Madeline as M, and say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Camden as C and Sarah as S. This gives us the equation C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with each box holding 8 crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

To find out how many boxes Nik will need, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, let's find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs, as each log is 4 feet.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given: Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, which means he earns $10,000 per month. To find their combined salary, we add Valerie's and her brother's earnings: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Now, we know their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down Grandma's walking routine. She walks 3 miles every day, consisting of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula distance/speed = time. Since the distance on the beach is 2 miles and the time is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40, where x is her speed in miles per minute.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute. This is her speed on the beach.

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we get time = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"Let's break down Jane's savings. She has been saving $4 of her allowance every week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply her weekly savings by the number of weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she continues to save $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"Let's count the blue birds together. We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds in each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds in each, which gives us 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. And finally, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can set up an equation: x + 24 = 84, where x is the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

"Let's dive into the problem. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees. The other mug's temperature is unknown. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle into his water bottle, he's able to drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the bottle after the transfer must be at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the average temperature of the two mugs multiplied by the total ounces of water in the bottle. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2, where x is the temperature of the second bottle. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, the temperature of the second bottle cannot be negative, so the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

"Let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00 with 9 bagels inside. To find the total cost of 4 packs, we multiply the cost of one pack by 4.

Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops he ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to figure out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We're told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's start by finding out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Now, we multiply the number of groups by the number of potatoes per group. 9 * 3 = 27.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

"Let's calculate the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade. 

To do this, we need to find the total number of lemons he gets in a year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find the total number of lemons he gets in a decade, which is 10 years. We multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

To find the number of women on the bus, we need to determine what fraction of the total passengers they represent. Since women make up 9 out of 14 parts of the ratio, we can calculate their fraction as 9/14.

Now, we multiply this fraction by the total number of passengers on the bus, which is 84: (9/14) * 84 = 54. This means there were initially 54 women on the bus.

However, 20 women alighted from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract the number of women who got off from the initial number: 54 - 20 = 34.

So, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"Let's break down Adam's rock stand business. He has $100 to invest and wants to buy rocks for $5 each to sell them for $7 each. 

First, we need to find out how many rocks he can buy with his $100. To do this, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, Adam only sells 12 rocks, so he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Since Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find out how much money he loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lauren is a cartoonist with different drawing capacities for large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes. She can draw 5 large scenes, 6 medium scenes, or 7 small scenes per day.

To determine how many days it will take her to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of scene. 

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one project at a time, the number of days it will take her to complete the project is the maximum of these values. In this case, it will take her 9 days to complete the project.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two lottery tickets, and we want to find the probability that both of them are winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

Now, we need to convert this decimal to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's dive into the problem. We have three friends - Carlos, Jim, and Carrey - who gathered seashells at the beach. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This means Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Now, let's find out how many seashells Carrey collected. We know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let R be the number of seashells Carrey collected, then 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

So, we have the following number of seashells collected by each person: Jim (27), Carlos (22), and Carrey (11). To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide them equally, we need to add up the total number of seashells and then divide by 3.

Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60
Number of people = 3
Seashells per person = Total seashells / Number of people = 60 / 3 = 20

"Let's calculate how many carrots Mason eats in a week. 

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's calculate the total time of the cassette. 

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Linus bought a mobile device for $20 and sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which is $40. 

To find the profit from each device, we subtract the cost price from the selling price: $40 - $20 = $20. 

Since Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. The total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find his height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carla has 8 identical octuplets, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. To do this, we multiply the total number of babies by the fraction of each color.

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find out how many babies wearing purple and blue are also wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows, so we multiply the number of purple babies by 1/3.

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

We also know that all the blue babies are wearing bows, so we add that to the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the correct answer is 50%."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"Let's figure out Geb's age. We know Haley is 26 years old. To find Geb's age, we need to find half of Haley's age first. 

Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we need to find 10 less than 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

So, Geb is 3 years old."
"The question is quite simple, really. If Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, we need to calculate how many face masks he uses in a day. 

To do that, we multiply the number of times he changes his mask by the number of times he goes out in a day. 

2 * 3 = 6

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we simply multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

So, the answer is quite straightforward: Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many eggs each person found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of apartments. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life.

First, we know that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. Then, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

Next, a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

Now, we're told that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.

The 9th year is a bit of an exception, as the tree doesn't produce any fruits.

Finally, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

We can use this information to find the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, we can set up the equation x - 200 = 1000 to solve for x. Solving for x, we get x = 1200.

Now that we know the production of a 10-year-old tree, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much money that is, we need to divide $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we need to add this amount to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has a total of $120."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express the combined length of the ropes as R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B into this equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37. This gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37. Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12. Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a wall mural with four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, which means the total amount of these three colors is 3 times the amount of one of them. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

We know the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is 6 pints. This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can represent the amount of each of these colors as x. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house, and each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet. To find the total area of the bedrooms, we multiply the length and width of one bedroom: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply this area by 4: 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Now, let's consider the living room. It's mentioned that it's 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5: 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

We also know that the rest of the house has an area of 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"I'm Anastasia, and I'd be happy to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a special size box of dishwasher pods that costs the same as a regular box, which is $12. However, this special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the special box. To do this, we calculate 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that we can run 120 cycles with the special box for $12, since we use 1 pod per cycle. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

So, with the special box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. To find the remaining chalk, we need to calculate 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Now, we know the teacher recycles the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class with 12 boys and 12 girls, making a total of 24 students.

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so we need to find one-third of 12. To do this, we divide 12 by 3, which equals 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so we need to find one-fourth of 12. To do this, we divide 12 by 4, which equals 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity. 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7 students are on varsity.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. 

First, we need to find the number of teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we need to find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two pieces of information about Wendy and Colin's ages.

First, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

Second, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, let's substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob has $27,000 to spend on books, and he can buy 100 books for $500. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with the money he has. To do this, we'll divide the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books.

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27,000 / $500
Total books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he's distributing the money to 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of books by 3.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's determine the number of bags. Since the coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight per bag:

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know the cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. 

First, we need to find out how many slices of cheese pizza they eat in total. Since each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36.

Next, we need to find out how many slices of pepperoni pizza they eat in total. Since each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, and her friends eat 36 slices in total, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

Similarly, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, and her friends eat 24 slices in total, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds per minute, we divide 20 by 60, which gives us 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, we also need to consider that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. To do this, we divide the number of snowballs by the rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we need to find John's age 20 years ago. To do that, we subtract 20 from John's current age: 28 - 20 = 8.

Now, we know that John was 8 years old 20 years ago, and he was twice as old as Jim at that time. So, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

So, Jim is 24 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than her, which is 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"May is getting her hair cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, how much did her cut and color cost?

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the difference in length and multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Initial length: 10 inches
Final length: 8 inches
Difference in length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches

Cost per inch: $30
Cost for 2 inches: 2 * $30 = $60

Adding the cost of the color: $40
Total cost: $60 + $40 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's break down Jen's earnings for April. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and her hourly rate is $1.5. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April.

To find her total hours worked, we multiply her daily hours by the number of days she worked: 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours.

Now, let's calculate her regular pay: 180 hours * $1.5 per hour = $270.

In addition to her regular pay, Jen receives a $10 bonus for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and attendance bonus: $270 + $240 = $510.

The final answer is: $510"
"Let's break down Jason's earnings for the two-week period. He earned $3.00 for doing his laundry, which he did once. So, that's $3.00.

He also earned $1.50 for cleaning his room, and he did that once as well. That's another $1.50.

For taking the trash out, he earned $0.75 each time, and he did it twice. So, that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

Lastly, he earned $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher, and he did that 6 times. That's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up all his earnings: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"Let's dive into the problem. We know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark by multiplying the amount of blood in a whale by 3. 

So, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, if we have ten sharks, we need to find the total amount of blood they have. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 

Finally, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) = 90
90 + 80 (lunch) = 170
170 + 150 (evening) = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Now, let's consider the black pens. We know Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, let's consider the cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so we need to calculate the additional cost per bottle. 50% of $60 is $60 * 0.5 = $30. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

To find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: 20 * $90 = $1800.

Now, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total cost: $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on his first day. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the events surrounding the root beer. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer. However, his children drank 4 gallons of it on the first day. This leaves us with 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, Fred's wife, Barbie, accidentally spilled 7 gallons of root beer. This reduces the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

The next day, Fred's friend Ronnie took 5 gallons of root beer, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, on the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party. To find out how much root beer each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people. So, 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as 4x + 8.

We can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a total of 66 fish in the tank. To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of 66.

One-third of 66 = 66 / 3 = 22

Now, let's find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. We'll subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the situation. Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which gives her a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had three makeup sets, each containing six eyeshadow colors, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister then stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is 3. So, she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's break down the information given about Mattison's house. We know that Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, which means the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Now, we're told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 inches. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

This means the second floor is 240 inches high. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:
420 - 240 = 180 inches

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 700 shells in total, and team Alphas found 40% of them. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 0.4 by 700.

0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and they need to walk a total of 12 miles on average per day. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs. 

First, let's add up the miles walked by the first three dogs: 
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"Let's break down John's situation. He's mortgaging his house, which is worth $250,000. He decides to take out a loan for 40% of that amount.

First, we need to calculate 40% of $250,000. To do this, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000.

0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this loan amount to pay off his debts. We calculate 60% of $100,000 by multiplying 0.6 by $100,000.

0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's calculate Deandre's earnings from selling the tunas. 

The first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting.

The medium setting removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and the high setting removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

Next, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"The water balloon fight with my friends sounds like so much fun. To figure out how many balloons were thrown, I need to calculate the total number of balloons and then subtract the ones that are left.

First, I know that we filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, the total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Now, I need to subtract the number of balloons that are left. We have 12 balloons left, so I'll subtract those from the total: 300 - 12 = 288.

I'm so excited to see how many balloons we threw!"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, let's find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"The problem at hand is quite intriguing. We have a jar with a square base, measuring 6 inches by 6 inches, and a height of 15 inches. The jar is filled with jelly beans, each with a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. However, the jelly beans are packed with an efficiency of 80%, and only 30% of them are red.

To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Considering the packing efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't specify what Tim's guess was, so we will assume he guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"Let's break down Pauline's museum visits. She goes to the museum 3 times a year. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. So, the annual cost for her visits is 3 * $2 = $6. For the first 5 years, the total cost would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's consider the increased cost. The cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total cost for all visits, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

"I'm Anastasia, and I'm here to help you figure out how long it will take for all the students at Cedar Falls Middle School to try the escape room.

To start, we need to know that there are 4 grades at the school (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. That's a total of 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Now, we know that each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ian has a 40-foot board and he wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's call the length of the shorter piece ""x"". This means the longer piece is 4x.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he'll need, let's first figure out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now, we know Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. To find the total seasoning needed, we multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Let's break down the costs for Karen's salon visit. A basic manicure starts at $35, and a pedicure starts at $40. If she chooses to get both, the salon offers a 20% discount on the total cost of the services.

First, calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's break down the information given. Susan has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues. She also has one magazine that sends 6 issues a year. The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to add up the issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

From point 1, we know that Shelley has 12 more paintings than Samantha. Since Samantha has 27 paintings, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

From point 2, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Since Shelley has 39 paintings, Kim must have 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's calculate the price of the toy after the discounts.

First, we need to find the price in December after an 80% increase from the initial price of $40. 
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price in January after a 50% decrease from the price in December.
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"Let's break down Charlie's income for the day. He has 4 standard rate lessons and 2 reduced rate lessons. 

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie charges 75% of his standard rate, which is $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. 
Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the amounts from the standard and reduced rate lessons together.
Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her math quiz scores and divide by the total number of scores.

Let's start by adding up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to determine what 1/4 of 20 is.

To find 1/4 of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/4: 20 * (1/4) = 5. This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

Since Eve originally had 20 pomelos and is left with 5, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the remaining amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, Walter bought 60 apples from the store. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"Let's break down the problem. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. To find the total number of novels she wrote this year, we need to determine what 1 quarter of the novels is and then multiply it by 4.

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters, we can find 1 quarter by dividing 9 by 3.

9 / 3 = 3

Now, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

3 * 4 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down Michael's journey. He's traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, which takes into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, and other activities. 

To find the distance he covers in 3 days, we need to calculate the total hours he's traveled. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael has traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, let's calculate the distance covered:

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance covered, we'll use the following formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Then, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Now, their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies. The total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. The total number of grapes used is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 102.

The final answer is: $\boxed{102}$"
"Let's figure out how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School that day. 

First, we need to find out how many teachers weren't sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 of them were sick. So, the number of teachers who weren't sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

Now, we know that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we just need to add the number of teachers who weren't sick to the number of substitute teachers. That's 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's break down the costs for Bud's macaroni and cheese. The pasta costs $1.00 per box. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount, which is $6.00, on gruyere cheese.

To find the total weekly cost, we add the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00 per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 to find the total yearly cost: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the custodian has to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. 

First, we need to find the total time they have to clean. They work 8 hours a day for 5 days, so the total time is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

Now, let's convert the time it takes to clean one classroom from minutes to hours: 15 minutes is 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours.

The total time to clean all the classrooms is 80 * 0.25 = 20 hours.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Elly's bookcases have three shelves each. The middle shelves can hold 10 books, and the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 15 books.

To find the total capacity of one bookcase, we add the capacity of all three shelves: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Now, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Now, we know that there are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. 

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of them are red, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red ones. That would be 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which is 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left, which are the white hats. We already know that 50 hats are left after removing the red ones, and 30 of them are blue. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"Let's break down Audrey's situation. She needs to get 70% of the total questions right to pass 6th grade. The total number of questions is 70 (from the first test) + 40 (from the second test) = 110 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in total, we multiply 110 by 70% (or 0.7). 
0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she got 60% of the first test's questions right, we need to find out how many that is. 60% of 70 is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right. 
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto 7th grade.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We can express the number of blueberry cubes in terms of the number of strawberry cubes: B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116: S + B = 116.

Now, let's substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. To sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"The power goes out in my house, and my family and I gather all our candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in our house, and we have 4 people living here, including me. Each person has a flashlight, and there are two flashlights for each room. We have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms.

Let's start by counting the flashlights. Since there are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's count the candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"The poor Phineas Frog. He's been washed away by the rainstorm and now he needs to find his way back home. Let's break down his journey into two parts: hopping on land and swimming through the water.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land. If he needs to cover half of the distance, which is 100 yards, we can calculate the time it takes by dividing the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

Now, let's consider his swimming speed. Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in the water. Since the other half of the distance is in the water, he also needs to cover 100 yards. We can calculate the time it takes by dividing the distance by his swimming speed: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

To find the total time it takes Phineas to return home, we simply add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone costs $20.

To find the cost of the additional phones, we need to determine the cost of one additional phone. Let's call this cost x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which means Conor saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days. It's simply the sum of the people he saw each day: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the people he saw on the first three days to the people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Garrett is popping popcorn, and we need to find the total number of pieces he has to eat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:

"Let's calculate the number of lemons Tim needs for the party. He's making 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 4 gallons.

Total cups of juice for the regular lemonade = 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups

For the extra tart lemonade, which is twice as tart as the other gallons, we need to find out how many cups of juice are required. This lemonade is 1 gallon, and since it's twice as tart, it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Now, let's find out how many lemons are needed for the regular lemonade. 

Total lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 4 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 4/6 * 6 = 4 lemons

For the extra tart lemonade, we need to find out how many lemons are required.

Total lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Now, let's add the lemons needed for both the regular and extra tart lemonade.

Total lemons needed = 4 lemons (for the regular lemonade) + 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) = 6 lemons

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the Kennel house. They have 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. 

Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. 

To find the total daily consumption, we need to add the consumption of both breeds. 
Daily consumption of German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day
Daily consumption of Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day
Total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

Now, we need to multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to find the weekly consumption. 
Weekly consumption: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's count the animal legs on the farm. We have 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each. 

For the 2-legged animals, we have 10 * 2 = 20 legs. 
For the 4-legged animals, we have 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since we want to find the number of pairs of legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 4 blue blocks in the tower. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks by multiplying the number of blue blocks by 2. 

4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks

Now, we know the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

To find the number of red blocks, we need to subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks in the tower, which is 32.

32 - 12 = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down Elvis's journey. He travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Then, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. To find the distance traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's calculate the value of the boat after three years.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated by another 30%, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated by 20%, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a large bag of Starbursts candy with a total of 232 pieces. We know that there are 54 red candies in the bag. 

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it's 2 * 54 = 108.

Now, let's find the number of yellow candies. It's mentioned that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27.

To find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies, we add them together: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Now, to find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"Let's break down Helen's expenses for her trip to Germany. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. Since she stayed for 3 nights and one night costs $80, we multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights. 
Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Number of nights: 3
Total cost of the hotel: $80 * 3 = $240

Next, we need to find the cost of the bus trips. We know that each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. 
Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Cost of one bus trip: 10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8
Number of bus trips: 7
Total cost of the bus trips: $8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the overall expense. 
Total cost of the hotel and bus travels: $240 + $56 = $296

"Let's figure out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla. 

First, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas received. We know that after dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has 21. So, to find out how many marbles he had initially, we add the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now.

Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"Let's break down the expenses for the family's trip to the cinema. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets. There are two adult tickets at $12 each, so that's 2 * $12 = $24. Then, there's a child ticket for $8. 

Next, we have the cost of the popcorns. They bought 2 popcorns for $3 each, so that's 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $24 (tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

"Let's calculate the total weight of John's car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each of the two children weighs 75 pounds. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to move the car.

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Mia is 40 years old and she's younger than Emma. Since they are 16 years apart in age, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age. So, Emma's age would be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to add their ages together and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. Now, we divide 96 by 2 to get the average age.

The average age of Mia and Emma is 96 / 2 = 48.

"Let's count the seashells together. Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. When they cleaned them, they discovered that 67 were cracked.

To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Total seashells found = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732
Total cracked seashells = 67

Total good seashells = Total seashells found - Total cracked seashells
Total good seashells = 732 - 67
Total good seashells = 665

"Let's calculate how much feed is left after a week.

First, we need to find out how much feed the pigs eat in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total amount of feed they eat in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"Let's calculate how much John needs to spend on hot dogs for his party.

First, we need to figure out how many hot dogs he needs in total. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs per guest:
20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total required:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Let's break down the information given. We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother.

Since one brother is 12 years old, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of the sisters. Since there are 3 sisters and each is 16 years old, their total age is 3 * 16 = 48 years.

Next, we need to find the total age of the brothers. We already know that one brother is 12 years old, and the other is 24 years old. So, the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters. This is 48 + 36 = 84 years.

"Let's break down Charisma's daily routine. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which totals 30 minutes per day. Since she does this every day of the week, we multiply 30 minutes by 7 days to get the weekly meditation time: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Now, let's look at her yoga routine. She practices yoga for 1 hour, or 60 minutes, 5 days a week. To find the total yoga time per week, we multiply 60 minutes by 5 days: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week, we add the weekly meditation time and yoga time: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

Since we want to know the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

Anne's height = 2 * 36 = 72 inches

Now, we know that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's height, we subtract 2 inches from Anne's height.

Jackie's height = 72 - 2 = 70 inches

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we need to subtract 3 inches from her current height to find her height before summer.

Jackie's height before summer = 70 - 3 = 67 inches

"I'm happy to help you with Jake's shopping trip. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

"Let's break down the cost of making one jar of Tim's special honey and jam mix. It requires 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound, and 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound.

The cost of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12.
The cost of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12.
The cost of honey is 2 * $10 = $20.

Adding these costs together, we get the total cost of making one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, let's consider the selling price of one jar, which is $50. To find the profit from one jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

"Let's break down the situation with Randy and his cookies. He starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 18 cookies.

Randy then eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he's down to 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.

Next, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with 9 - 2 = 7 oatmeal cookies. He still has 4 chocolate chip cookies and 5 sugar cookies, so the total number of cookies is now 7 + 4 + 5 = 16.

After that, Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 5 - 2 = 3 sugar cookies. The total number of cookies is now 7 + 4 + 3 = 14.

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This adds 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies to his collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies initially = 18
Cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7
Cookies baked = 12

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. To find the total number of holes dug, we multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days Nate was on vacation.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. However, the problem doesn't specify how many days Nate fills the holes, so we'll assume he fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"Let's solve the mystery of the Adams family's cookies. They've made a total of 7995 cookies so far. We know they have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies together: 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, let's subtract this number from the total number of cookies: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This statement is incorrect, but we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. So, if he gathered 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, then he gathered 12 Petri dishes (since 12 + 2 = 14, but 14 is the number of test tubes, not the number of Petri dishes, so 12 is the correct number of Petri dishes).
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's calculate how many screws James will have left over after putting together the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's count the eggs together. We have 10 eggs in the first basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first one, we need to multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2 to find the number of eggs in the second basket.

So, 10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, she raises $430 + $320 = $750.

We also know that Sarah raises $300, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a relay race with Aaron and Vanessa as partners. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes. Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa, we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost price of one watermelon. The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. 

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon. The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. This means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).

Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had James when he was 19, which means the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this means the information given is inconsistent.

But let's continue with the problem. We are also told that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son is currently 32 years old. In 3 years, his age will be 32 + 3 = 35 years.

The final answer is: 35"
"I'm Ana, and I'm excited to help you with this problem. Let's get started.

If I spend 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same, we both start peeling oranges at the same time. We want to know how many more oranges I'll have peeled than Jane after an hour.

To figure this out, I need to calculate how many oranges each of us can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour. On the other hand, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Jane and me. It's simply 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, I'll have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the cost of Mark's new radiator. 

First, we need to find the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and Mark gets an 80% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original cost by 0.8: 400 * 0.8 = $320. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted price: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We can write two equations based on the given information:

1. C + W = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
2. 2C + 4W = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem. We have 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). So, we divide 56 by 4 to find out how many slices each person can have: 56 / 4 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
