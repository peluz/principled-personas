"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for muffins. So, in total, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs she has left. We subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to figure out how much white fiber is required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"So Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then put in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. To find out how much profit he made, we need to first find the new value of the house.

The original value of the house was $80,000. When Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, it increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 150% of the original value plus the original value. 

To find 150% of the original value, we multiply the original value by 1.5 (since 100% is the original value, and 150% is 100% + 50% more). 

150% of $80,000 = $80,000 * 1.5
150% of $80,000 = $120,000

Now, we add this to the original value to find the new value:
New value = Original value + 150% of original value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost of the house is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to figure out how many meters he runs in one session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to know how much feed she gives them in total per day and how much she gives them per meal.

First, let's find out how much feed Wendi gives her chickens in total per day. She gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to find the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the cost of the remaining 13 glasses. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
The fifth glass costs 60% of $1.08, which is 0.6 * $1.08 = $0.648. 
The sixth glass costs 60% of $0.648, which is 0.6 * $0.648 = $0.3888. 
The seventh glass costs 60% of $0.3888, which is 0.6 * $0.3888 = $0.23328. 
The eighth glass costs 60% of $0.23328, which is 0.6 * $0.23328 = $0.139968. 
The ninth glass costs 60% of $0.139968, which is 0.6 * $0.139968 = $0.0839856. 
The tenth glass costs 60% of $0.0839856, which is 0.6 * $0.0839856 = $0.05039136. 
The eleventh glass costs 60% of $0.05039136, which is 0.6 * $0.05039136 = $0.030234816. 
The twelfth glass costs 60% of $0.030234816, which is 0.6 * $0.030234816 = $0.0181407896. 
The thirteenth glass costs 60% of $0.0181407896, which is 0.6 * $0.0181407896 = $0.01088447776. 
The fourteenth glass costs 60% of $0.01088447776, which is 0.6 * $0.01088447776 = $0.006530686656. 
The fifteenth glass costs 60% of $0.006530686656, which is 0.6 * $0.006530686656 = $0.0039184169936. 
The sixteenth glass costs 60% of $0.0039184169936, which is 0.6 * $0.0039184169936 = $0.00236105019616.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447776 + $0.006530686656 + $0.0039184169936 + $0.00236105019616 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's figure out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we multiply 20 by 4 to find out how many sheep Charleston has. 20 * 4 = 80.

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply 80 by 2 to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. 80 * 2 = 160.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find out how long it takes Carla to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. First, let's figure out how long it takes to download 40% of the file. Since the file is 200 GB and Carla can download 2 GB per minute, we can find the time it takes to download 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) by dividing 80 by 2.

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, we need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates. So, the total time so far is 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

But we're not done yet. We still need to download the other 60% of the file, which is 120 GB. To find the time it takes to download 120 GB, we divide 120 by 2.

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file to the time it took to download the first 40% and install the updates.

60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

First, let's find the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's find the distance John traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:

Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

Next, let's find the distance John traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Then, let's find the distance John traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances John traveled in the return trip:

15 + 160 = 175 miles

The total distance John traveled in the first 3 hours is 180 miles, and the total distance he traveled in the return trip is 175 miles. 

To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to find the distance he traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

The correct answer is 0 miles."
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

First, let's find her earnings for the first 40 hours. Since she works for $10 per hour, we multiply 40 hours by $10. That's 40 * 10 = $400.

Now, let's find her earnings for the overtime hours. She worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * 10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * 12 = $60.

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours. That's $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 0.3 by 180, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. 3 dozen donuts cost $68 per dozen, so 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we'll find the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we'll find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen, so 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The total cost of the tree is $90 (initial cost).

The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year.

The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.

So, the net revenue each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself, we need to divide the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this is the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself, but we want to know when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we need to consider the first year as the year it starts earning money.

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she had x vacuum cleaners initially, then she sold x/3 at the green house. This means she had 2x/3 left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had 2x/3 - 2 left.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 - 2 is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1.

Now, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20 * 0.2 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to get the remaining students: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 16 * 0.25 = 4 students.

So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. To find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out which item will increase in value the most, we need to calculate the increase in value for each item.

For the jewelry, we multiply the cost by the percentage increase: 2.5% of $5,000. To find 2.5% of $5,000, we multiply 0.025 (which is 2.5% as a decimal) by $5,000. This gives us 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets, we multiply the cost by the percentage increase: 1.2% of $8,000. To find 1.2% of $8,000, we multiply 0.012 (which is 1.2% as a decimal) by $8,000. This gives us 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in the same direction for the first day, which is westward. They cover a distance of 80 miles each.

The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles each.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

In this case, the two sides of the right-angled triangle are the distances traveled on the first and second days. We can use the formula:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the total distance).

Plugging in the values, we get:

80^2 + 150^2 = c^2
6400 + 22500 = c^2
28900 = c^2
c = √28900
c = 170

So, the total distance covered by each train is 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she makes from teaching and coaching, then add those two amounts together.

First, let's figure out how much she makes from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works to find the total hours she works in a year. That's 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year. Now, we multiply the total hours she works by her hourly wage: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year.

Next, let's find out how much she makes from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. We multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works to find the total hours she works in a year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year. Now, we multiply the total hours she works by her hourly wage: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year.

Now that we have her earnings from teaching and coaching, we add those two amounts together to find her total annual salary: $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, we multiply the total number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to figure out how much time she has left to walk. She's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. Since she wants to walk the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time she needs to complete the hike by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to start by finding the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 
Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.
Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. 
The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.
The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to figure out how old Raymond is now. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. So, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age. 

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when he had a son) = 2 years.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to add up the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find out how much shorter the candle will be, we need to know how long it burns and how fast it melts. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the time it burns by the rate at which it melts.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out how much the discount was and add it back to the price Kyle paid.

Let's say the original price is 'x'. Since Kyle got a 25% discount, that means he paid 75% of the original price. We can write this as 0.75x.

We know that 0.75x is equal to $19.50. To find the original price, we need to divide $19.50 by 0.75.

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

So, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she bought that we know the quantity of. 

The chicken meal costs $12, the 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15, and the 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

So, the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now, we know that Marie paid a total of $50. To find the cost of the pizza boxes, we subtract the cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount she paid: $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the shorts. Since Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts and each pair costs $16.50, we multiply 3 by $16.50 to get the total cost of the shorts. 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, we find the cost of the pants. Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $22.50. We multiply 3 by $22.50 to get the total cost of the pants. 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Now, let's find the cost of the shoes. Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $42. We multiply 3 by $42 to get the total cost of the shoes. 3 x $42 = $126.

Finally, we add the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes together to find the total amount Mishka spent. $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to figure out how many cartons she buys and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, and she needs 60 servings for 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she needs:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton, which is $4.00:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to figure out how far apart they are. 

We know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, the more expensive pair of heels costs 2 * 33 = $66.

We're also told that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. If we add the cost of both pairs of heels, we get 33 + 66 = $99. Since this is $5 less than the boots, we can set up an equation: B = 99 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a number that we need to find. We know that their total age is 162, so we can write an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Now, divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to find the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, 80 + 20 = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate how many hours he spends per day. 

John has 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

So, we multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog: 
10 * 0.5 = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily time by 7 to get the total time spent in a week: 
5 * 7 = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is S. Then, the number of gold coins is S + 30.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of coins: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to S: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We're told that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of 40 is 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first figure out how many yogurts he eats in that time. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we multiply 2 by 30 to get the total number of yogurts.

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. We do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4.

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Since each set costs $5.00, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total amount spent.

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is 195 - 5 = 190 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money he made:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

This means John spent $35 of his own money to buy the video games. Since he spent $35 of his own money, he must have used the remaining money from the Lego sales to buy the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35.
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to figure out how many hours he runs in a week and then divide the total distance by that number.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

So, his total running time for the week is 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

Since he runs 3 days a week, we multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time. 
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to figure out how fast she can walk and run. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's think about the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she has six hours, she spends 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking and 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure out how old Brandon's iPhone is.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. To find out how old Ben's iPhone is, we multiply the age of Suzy's iPhone by 2. 

So, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we multiply the age of Ben's iPhone by 4.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit it with the javelin, we need to figure out how far she can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The original distance Polly can throw the javelin is 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. This is because she can throw the javelin 1200 feet, and 1000 feet is within that range.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to know the total number of pieces and the number of pieces that were left. 

First, we find the total number of pieces: Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were taken. We know that there were 14 pieces left, so we subtract that from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, we need to subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can eat with 200 calories. Each serving of chips has 250 calories. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, we multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 * 300 = 240 grams

The final answer is: 240"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to figure out how much money he makes from selling the candles and how much it costs him to make them.

First, let's find out how much money he makes from selling the candles. He sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find out how much it costs him to make the candles. It costs $10.00 for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, and he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to know how many articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write one article, which is 4 hours.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we multiply 2/5 by 5, which is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4: 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's figure out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She bought a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package, we need to add the Post-it notes she used and the ones she had left, then subtract that from the total number of Post-it notes she had initially.

Let's do the math:

Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package = 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)

We can simplify this by adding the initial and remaining Post-it notes, then subtracting the ones used:

80 + 23 = 103
103 - 220 = -117 (this is the opposite of what we want, so we need to make it positive)

To make it positive, we need to add 220 + 117 = 337 to the initial Post-it notes (80) to get the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package.

337 - 80 = 257

So, the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is 257. This is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining.

Now, let's find out how many Post-it notes were in the package:

257 = 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)

Subtract 80 and 23 from both sides:
257 - 80 - 23 = x
154 = x

The final answer is: 154"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we need to find out how much each red tie costs. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means each red tie costs 1.5 times the price of a blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, so 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4. 

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (4). So, 120 * 1 = 120, and then 120 / 4 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week, we need to know how many eggs his chickens produce and how much he sells them for.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs they produce in a week, we multiply the number of eggs per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week.

1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we know that Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes per week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled and his speed. Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, that's a 3-hour time period, and his speed is 10 miles per hour. 

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 10 miles per hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can find the time it takes to travel back at 6 miles per hour.

Time = distance / speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight (15 pounds) by the weight of each toy to find the number of toys to be removed: 15 / 0.5 = 30.

However, we need to consider that the weight of the comic books has already been removed, so we need to subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed. The weight of the toys to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we can divide the weight of the toys to be removed by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Now, we need to package 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops."

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final bill. To do this, we multiply the final bill by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). 

0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Next, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Then, we add the delivery fee:
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

20% of 25 oranges is 0.2 x 25 = 5 oranges. 

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.

"Let's break it down step by step. Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years. For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The full pension is $50,000 per year. So, for 10 years, she gets 10 years * $50,000/year = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of the value of the pension. 5% is the same as 0.05. So, 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000 per year.

Now, we add the two amounts together. $50,000 per year (for the first 10 years) + $25,000 per year (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000 per year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year is 6 months and the second half of the year is also 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. Then we subtract $14 from $140 to get 90% of $140, which is $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how many miles her car can go on one gallon of gas. We can figure this out by dividing the distance she traveled since her last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

miles per gallon = distance / gas used
miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
miles per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the miles per gallon.

total miles = tank capacity * miles per gallon
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys') with 5 players each, so the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team.

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems: 
Total gems = 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the price per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day for 5 weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total amount from the brownies and the total amount from the cheesecakes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount from the brownies. Since each brownie costs $3 and Tommy sells 43 brownies, we multiply 43 by 3. This gives us 43 * 3 = $129.

Next, we find the total amount from the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake costs $4 and Tommy sells 23 slices, so we multiply 23 by 4. This gives us 23 * 4 = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones. Since she bought 5 cell phones for $150 each, the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750.

Now, we need to add the interest charged for each unit. The interest is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. Since there are 5 units, the total interest charged is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find out how much Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar. 

Marigolds cost $2.74 per pot, so we round that to $3. Petunias cost $1.87 per pot, so we round that to $2. Begonias cost $2.12 per pot, so we round that to $2.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower. He sells 12 pots of marigolds, so that's 12 x $3 = $36. He sells 9 pots of petunias, so that's 9 x $2 = $18. He sells 17 pots of begonias, so that's 17 x $2 = $34.

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to know the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels by dividing the previous level's square footage by 2.

The second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage.
The third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage.
The fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. We also know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. To find out how much laundry David does, we need to divide the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4
= 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. To find out how much laundry Raymond does, we need to divide the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
= 200 pounds

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, we need to find 30% of $100. To do this, we multiply $100 by 0.3 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3).

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

The boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

First, let's add the stickers Charlie initially had to the ones he bought from the store. He had 10 stickers and bought 21 more, so he now has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Next, Charlie got 23 stickers for his birthday, so we add those to the total. Now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract those from the total. Now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract those from the total. Now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times that is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's call the number of games they lost ""L"" and the number of games they won ""W"".

Since they won 8 more games than they lost, we can write an equation: W = L + 8.

We also know that the total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22. So, we can write another equation: W + L = 22.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

So, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to figure out how many years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on each year.

Gene is 34 years old and started vacationing at 23, so he's been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations per year, we multiply 11 years by 4 vacations/year to get the total number of quilt blocks.

11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to figure out how many times it went off each time and add them up.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after a 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

First, we need to find the increase in her salary after 5 years. We do this by multiplying her initial salary by 10% (or 0.1). 

Initial salary: $600
Increase: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Increase: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.6
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.6 = $798.6
Increase: 10% of $798.6 = 0.1 * $798.6 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.6 + $79.86 = $878.46
Increase: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 9 years: $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

The final answer is: $966.31"
"Let's say Harald sold H copies of his record. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10H copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we need to figure out how many guests will actually show up to the party. Since 1/4 of the guests won't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

First, we need to find 1/4 of 16. To do this, we multiply 16 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 16 by 4. 

16 / 4 = 4

So, 1/4 of 16 is 4. Now, we subtract 4 from 16 to find the number of guests who will attend.

16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * $2 = $18

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount eaten by adults and children.

First, let's find out how much the adults will eat. There are 20 adults, and each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad. So, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the children will eat. There are 5 children, and each child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 pounds, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. So, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed. 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's figure out how many pets the three of them have.

We know Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Now, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To find Gerald's new time, we need to first find his original time. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40. 10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. So, the number of cats is 60 * 2 = 120.

Next, we need to find the combined number of dogs and cats. We can do this by adding the number of dogs and cats together: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

Now, we're told that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats to find the number of rabbits: 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply 2/3 by the total number of girls.

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to figure out the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 of them took an exit. This means that 30 - 5 = 25 cars drove through the traffic jam.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's call the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes 'x'. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars in the first 15 minutes and the cars in the remaining 15 minutes, which is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. To find out how many potted plants she has in total, we multiply the number of plants on each ledge by the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 80.

Then, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, we add these new plants to the total: 80 + 18 = 98.

Now, Mary wants to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. To find out how many plants she will give away, we multiply the number of plants given away per ledge by the total number of ledges: 1 * 40 = 40.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 20 by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles, we can divide 42 by 3.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the volume of the inner space of each box. 

First, we need to find the inner dimensions of the box. The box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions: 5 - 2 = 3 inches, 6 - 2 = 4 inches, and 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to figure out how much time he spent watching TV in total and then subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 one-hour episodes, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours. 

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which is 1.5 hours. 

On Friday, he watched 2 one-hour episodes, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

So, the total time spent watching one-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, we need to multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons.

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we need to first find the total number of roll-ups each person ate. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she ate 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. 
Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2 to find the average. 
Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to figure out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and multiply it by 2 liters per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

The final answer is: 10.24"
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to know how many lessons are taught and how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Now, we need to find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, and there are 8 lessons per day, we multiply the number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To find out how many flowers Ryan has, we need to figure out how many flowers he planted and then subtract the ones that didn't grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers didn't grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we're told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought. 

She has 10 boards that are 2 x 4 x 10 and cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 

She also has 5 boards that are 4 x 4 x 10 and cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, we need to find out how much she can sell each board for. Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of each board is 1.5 times the original price.

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Sasha has 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for 10 * $15 = $150. 
She has 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for 5 * $24 = $120.

The total amount of money she can make from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total amount of money she can make: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to figure out the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the total mixture is sugar. Since sugar is 7 parts out of 20, the fraction of the mixture that is sugar is 7/20.

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture, which is 120. 

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * 6 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid for the shoes, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children.

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

So, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, 4 containers were added on the second day.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Lylah was making four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 70% of $40000, which is 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first find out how many sheets he uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad has 30 sheets of paper, we multiply 2 by 30 to get the total sheets used in a week.

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks are in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Morisette brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits, and Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits they have, we add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts. First, she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find out how much time she has left to run. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, we need to find out how far she can run at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours.
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Julia bought a package of spoons, and then her husband gave her 5 more spoons. After that, she used 3 spoons, and then she had a total of 12 spoons left.

Let's say the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 'x'. 

When her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had a total of x + 5 spoons. 

Then, she used 3 spoons, so she had (x + 5) - 3 spoons left.

We know that after using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of each item. We know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45. 

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. He buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. Dillon also buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to figure out how much time the doctors spend with patients and how much money they make from those patients.

First, let's find out how many hours the doctors work in a day. There are 500 patients and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. We need to convert the minutes to hours, so we divide by 60.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes
12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, we know the doctors work 200 hours a day. They charge $150 an hour, so we multiply the hours by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we need to find out how much money the hospital makes from the patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and there are 500 patients. We need to multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate, but we need to convert the minutes to hours first.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes
12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours
200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

Now, we know the hospital makes $40000 and the doctors cost $30000. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee. There's a 20% delivery fee added at checkout. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20. 
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the tip. Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. This means he can complete the test in 75 / 5 = 15 hours. However, he only had 8 hours to complete it, so he finished 8 * 5 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. This means he can complete the test in 100 / 5 = 20 hours. However, he only had 6 hours, so he finished 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

Now, let's add up the questions Mark completed in both tests: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the questions he completed from the total number of questions in both tests. The total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175.

So, the number of questions Mark left incomplete is 175 - 70 = 105.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to know how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

First, let's find the number of semi-automatic cars. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars. To do this, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's say the number of queens is Q. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q, and the number of worker bees is 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

To find the number of queens, we divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

And finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

"To find the total cost of everything John bought, we need to add up the cost of all the items and then calculate the tax on the non-food items.

First, let's add up the cost of the food items: milk and eggs. 
- Milk costs 2 dollars.
- Eggs cost 3 dollars.
So, the total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, let's add up the cost of the non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. 
- Light bulbs cost 3 dollars.
- Cups cost 3 dollars.
- Roach traps cost 4 dollars.
So, the total cost of the non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. The tax is 10% of the cost of the non-food items. 
10% of 10 dollars is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees. So, 15 bees return to the hive.

Now, let's think about the bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and then 15 of them returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees haven't returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's think about the bees that haven't returned yet. We had 15 bees from the first group, and then 60 bees left in the last 6 hours. That makes a total of 15 + 60 = 75 bees that haven't returned yet.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. That means 15 bees return to the hive.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can use this information to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"To figure out who wins the race, we need to calculate how long it takes for Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve lives 3 miles away from school, and since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we multiply 3 miles by 5280 to get the total distance in feet. 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. Steve can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Tim lives 2 miles away from school, which is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's figure out how many bicycle tires were inflated. Since each bicycle has 2 tires and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated, we multiply 5 by 2 to get 10 bicycle tires.

Now, we multiply the number of bicycle tires by the cost to inflate one tire, which is 25 cents. So, 10 * 25 cents is $2.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. We multiply 3 by 3 to get 9 tricycle tires.

We then multiply the number of tricycle tires by the cost to inflate one tire, which is 25 cents. So, 9 * 25 cents is $2.25.

Finally, we calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. Since a unicycle has 1 tire and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated, we multiply 1 by 1 to get 1 unicycle tire.

We then multiply the number of unicycle tires by the cost to inflate one tire, which is 25 cents. So, 1 * 25 cents is $0.25.

Now, we add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies inside. We need to find out how much change he gets if he pays with a $10 bill.

First, we need to find the total number of cookies. Since there are 10 packs and each pack has 6 cookies, we multiply 10 by 6.

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we need to find the change he receives. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

$10 - $6 = $4

So, Carl receives $4 in change."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Dave ate 14 french fries initially. Then, a seagull came and ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 french fries. So, the total number of fries eaten so far is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21.

Next, three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each, which is a total of 9 fries. Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30.

Let's say the total number of fries in the pack initially is x. After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. A raccoon then came and ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). The number of fries left after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30). After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6. Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18. Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends in class, we need to figure out how many hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo has 3 classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each class is 1 hour long, so that's 3 hours a day. Since there are 3 days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. That's 4 hours a day. Since there are 2 days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

So, in total, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class each week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester. To find the total hours, we multiply 17 hours by 16 weeks: 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's start with the rolls. Bill bakes 300 rolls every day, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.

Next, let's look at the croissants. Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches.

Now, let's consider the baguettes. Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. So, the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 24 = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To find out who wins the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the pens. Since there are 4 pens and each pen costs $1.5, we multiply 4 by $1.5 to get the total cost of the pens. 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we find the cost of the notebooks. There are 2 notebooks and each notebook costs $4, so we multiply 2 by $4 to get the total cost of the notebooks. 2 * $4 = $8.

Now, we know the cost of the bond paper is $20.

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break it down step by step. Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding from under a lily pad, so now he can see a total of 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

17 - 2 = 15

So, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish he caught, we add these numbers together: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

To find the total number of fish caught by Locsin, we add these numbers together: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. We add the total number of fish caught by Anakin to the total number of fish caught by Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

We can see a pattern here. The price is increasing by $4 every two months. To find the price after 36 months, we can multiply the number of times the price increases by $4, which is 18 times (36 months / 2 months), and add it to the initial price.

Price increase = $4 * 18
= $72

Price after 36 months = Initial price + Price increase
= $20 + $72
= $92

The final answer is: $92"
"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and one action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"So, let's figure this out. Jackie's thinking about doing her taxes herself or hiring an accountant. If she does it herself, she'll have to give up 3 hours of freelance work, which pays $35 an hour. That's a total of $105 she'll be missing out on.

Now, the accountant charges $90 to do the taxes. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the money she'll lose to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Let's do the math: $105 (money she'll lose) - $90 (cost of hiring the accountant) = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

First, let's add up the cost of all the accessories:

- The computer costs €1090.
- The scanner costs €157.
- The CD burner costs €74.
- The printer costs €102.

Adding these costs together, we get: €1090 + €157 = €1247, then €1247 + €74 = €1321, and finally €1321 + €102 = €1423.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of €1500:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To figure out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to know how many eggs she needs in total and how many eggs she gets per babysitting job. 

Sandra needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she's making 15, so she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs in total.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we let Brooke's current age be B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by multiplying Brooke's age by 2:

Seth's age = 2B
= 2(8)
= 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first figure out what twice the money Ethel has is. Since Ethel has $8, we multiply that by 2 to get 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in 7 days. 

There are 5 days in a week when Pancho walks 20 miles a day, and 2 days when he walks 10 miles a day. 

First, let's find the total miles he walks in the 5 days when he walks 20 miles a day: 20 * 5 = 100 miles. 

Next, let's find the total miles he walks on the 2 days when he walks 10 miles a day: 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked in the 5 days and the miles walked on the 2 days: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and add them together.

First, let's find the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs for the spiders is 80 * 8 = 640.

Next, let's find the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs for the insects is 90 * 6 = 540.

Now, let's find the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates, and each invertebrate has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs for the invertebrates is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of legs, we add the number of legs for each group together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The final answer is: 1210"
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The final answer is: 51"
"To figure out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to find out how much she pays each month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt. For her student loans, she pays 50% more than the minimum, which is $300. 50% of $300 is $150, so she pays $300 + $150 = $450.

For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200. 50% of $200 is $100, so she pays $200 + $100 = $300.

For her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500. 50% of $500 is $250, so she pays $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find out how long it takes Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply 1.5 minutes by 60 to get the total time it takes to peel all the potatoes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato. To convert this to minutes, we divide 5 by 60 since there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 minutes, which simplifies to 1/12 minutes. Now, we multiply 1/12 minutes by 60 to get the total time it takes to cut all the potatoes: (1/12) * 60 = 5 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to figure out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar.

First, let's find out how much they made per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + Cost

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

We can now solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + Cost) / $10

However, we don't know the total cost yet. We do know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

Since we know the cost of lemons per gallon, we can find the total cost of lemons by multiplying the cost of lemons per gallon by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + Cost) / $10)

We are given that the total profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we first need to figure out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 people in total and 80 of them were Japanese. 

So, the number of Chinese people is 240 - 80 = 160.

Now, we know that 60 of the Chinese people were boys. To find out how many girls there were, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

Number of girls = Total Chinese people - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent. Zaid earns 6000 dollars per month, and he spends 1/4 of that on rent. To find 1/4 of 6000, we can multiply 6000 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 6000 by 4. 

6000 / 4 = 1500

So, Zaid spends 1500 dollars on rent.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent on car fuel. Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. To find 1/3 of 6000, we can multiply 6000 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 6000 by 3.

6000 / 3 = 2000

So, Zaid spends 2000 dollars on car fuel.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel. We subtract the amount spent on rent and car fuel from his total salary.

6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Next, let's calculate the amount donated to charity. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. To find half of 2500, we can divide 2500 by 2.

2500 / 2 = 1250

So, Zaid donates 1250 dollars to charity.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after the donation. We subtract the amount donated from the remaining amount.

2500 - 1250 = 1250

Next, let's calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife. Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.

200 + 700 = 900

Finally, let's calculate the final remaining amount. We subtract the total amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

1250 - 900 = 350

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can find Monic's number of crabs by subtracting 4 from 40. 

40 - 4 = 36

So, Monic has 36 crabs. Now, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. To find Rani's number of crabs, we add 10 to Monic's number of crabs.

36 + 10 = 46

Now that we know the number of crabs each person has, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has.

40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much he earned in the first week. He tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are 5 x $10 = $50.

Next, let's find out how much he earned in the second week. He tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are 8 x $10 = $80.

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together: $50 + $80 = $130.

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now, we know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. To find the number of red roses, we need to multiply 40 by 4.

40 * 4 = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28. 

The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we need to find Mark's current age. To do this, we add 2 to Mark's age two years ago:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 222 = -2 seconds. However, since time can't be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference. The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're rolling a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes. To find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to find half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we divide 20 by 2 to find the number of apples Jenna picked. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples and her mom picked 20 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

We also know that there's a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among them.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mandy should pay back to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The interest rate is 2% per month, which is 0.02 as a decimal. 

For the first month, the interest is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
For the second month, the interest is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
For the third month, the interest is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

Adding up the interest, we get $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

Now, we add this interest to the initial amount of $100. $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out the total cost and total revenue.

Let's say the trader bought 'x' bags of wheat. The cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20), and the cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is $2x. The total cost is $20x + $2x, which is $22x.

The trader sold each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling the bags is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and it's given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. The tickets cost $20.25. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The rides cost $33 each, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to know how many peaches he collects per minute and how many minutes he collects.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Since he collects for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we need to first calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week and there are 10 ducks, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 ducks.

3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 to get the pounds of insects per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. To find the net change in the number of trees, we subtract the number of trees he chops down from the number he plants: 10 - 2 = 8.

This means that every year, Tom has 8 more trees than he had the year before.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, Tom has 80 more trees than he started with.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the neighbors put 18 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard on Friday. Then, they took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

Next, on Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to know how many crayons she can buy with the $20 she has. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots won't be used, we need to figure out how many pounds are being distributed and then subtract that from the total amount.

Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

So, we multiply the number of pounds each restaurant gets by the number of restaurants: 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount of carrots: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

That means 120 pounds of carrots won't be used.

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"To find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100, and twice that is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. He gets paid by two different publishers, A and B. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so he gets 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.

Since Mark edits the same number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"So, John gets a 5% raise on his salary of $2000 a week. To find the new salary, we need to calculate 5% of 2000.

5% of 2000 is 0.05 * 2000 = 100. So, his new salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since John gets the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he made that year:
Total amount = New salary * Number of weeks

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to do a couple of calculations.

First, we need to figure out how many tons of grapes are produced per year. Since each acre of her 10-acre farm produces 5 tons of grapes, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now that we know the farm produces 50 tons of grapes per year, we need to find out how many barrels of wine that makes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

First, let's look at the sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, let's consider the omelets. Carl made omelets for 3 days and used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

Now, let's look at the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for each meal together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had, we add these two numbers together: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then, Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens had 9 pens, and each bag of red pens had 6 pens. To find the total number of blue pens she bought, we multiply the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag: 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. To find the total number of red pens she bought, we multiply the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag: 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought to the number of pens she already had: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 new pens. Then, we add the new pens to the initial number of pens: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks. He rode 25 kilometers each time and did that 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, we multiply 25 by 5 and then by 4. 

25 * 5 = 125
125 * 4 = 500

So, in the first four weeks, he rode a total of 500 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks. He rode 60 kilometers each time and did that 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, we multiply 60 by 2 and then by 3.

60 * 2 = 120
120 * 3 = 360

So, in the next three weeks, he rode a total of 360 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs 40g. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, we multiply the cost of one plate by 6 (since there are 6 plates in a half dozen). So, 6 * $6000 = $36,000.
2. Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, we subtract $1200 from $36,000 to find the cost of twenty dozen cups. $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.
3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups. $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To figure out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to know how much money she needs to earn in total and how much she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. We also know that he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use the variables R for the number of red chickens and W for the number of white chickens. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write an equation: W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens. We can write an equation based on this information: 3R + 5W = 42.

Now, substitute W = R + 2 into the equation: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32.

Divide both sides by 8: R = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walks around the park. The park is a rectangle, and its perimeter is the distance around the outside. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

The length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we know the total distance is 15 miles, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the distance by his speed. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to know the number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day.

Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250
Customers on the third day = Total by the third day - Total customers on the first two days
Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
Customers on the third day = 250

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two pools, and both of them are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water four minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, it had 2x gallons of water four minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at the same rate, they both lost the same amount of water in the last four minutes. This means that the small pool now has x - 4 gallons of water, and the big pool now has 2x - 4 gallons of water.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

To solve for x, we can start by simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Next, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 4x - 12

Then, we can subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -12

Finally, we can divide both sides by -2:

x = 6

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water four minutes ago. Since the small pool lost 4 gallons in the last four minutes, it now has 6 - 4 = 2 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to first find their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

We know that Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the time spent on crossword puzzles. Since it takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle and she solved 3 of them, we multiply 10 minutes by 3. This gives us 30 minutes.

Next, we find the time spent on sudoku puzzles. Since it takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle and she solved 8 of them, we multiply 5 minutes by 8. This gives us 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles together. 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

"To find out how much water is in the tank now, we need to start by figuring out how much water is left after Celine used 90 liters. We subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, we know that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining 30 liters by 2 to find out how much rainwater she collected.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater to find the total amount of water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. 
Then, we know that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. 

The company spends a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3. 

$15000 / 3 = $5000.

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year ($15000) to the amount spent in the second year ($5000) to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000.

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to add the number of days it takes to travel to Rochester by bus and the number of days it takes to travel back from Rochester by car.

It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. 
It takes half as many days to travel by car, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days to travel by car from Rochester back to New Jersey.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (by bus) + 3 (by car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

James starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

First, let's find the total number of cards he has initially: 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Now, he loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32. The total number of cards now is 90 - 8 = 82.

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes 20 + 14 = 34. The total number of cards now is 82 + 14 = 96.

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

First, let's start with the base burrito, which costs $6.50. Then, he adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. Since there are 2 sauces, we multiply $0.25 by 2 to get $0.50. 

Now, let's add up the cost of the extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 

Next, we add the cost of the extra items to the base burrito: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. 

Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so we add that to the total: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Finally, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to know their combined rate of placing pieces. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces in the puzzle by their combined rate to find out how many minutes it will take to complete it. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

"To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready, we multiply 120 by 0.3. 
   0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

2. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after two months. We subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total number of watermelons.
   120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

3. Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. Since 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, we multiply 84 by 0.75.
   0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the number of watermelons left after two months.
   84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fee.

First, we find the total cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Mark pays 10% tax on the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1. This gives us $24,000.

Now, we need to find the registration fee. Mark pays $1000 for each car, and he has 12 cars. So, the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add up the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee to find the total cost. $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. We know that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. 

So, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to find the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants. 

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to figure out how many penguins jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. 

One-third of 36 penguins is 12 penguins. This is because 36 divided by 3 equals 12. So, 12 penguins jumped in the ocean and 12 penguins went inside the cave.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 
36 - 24 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many vines Steve needs for his cherry tomatoes.

First, we need to know how many tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat in a week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply that by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats in a week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to grow these tomatoes. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To figure out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and divide it by the number of slices per pizza.

First, we need to find the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend gets 4 slices, we multiply 20 by 4.

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we know that pizzas are sold in slices of 8. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza.

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break it down step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

So, from the 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. 

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

To find the total number of pens he gets, we add the initial 25 pens to the 5 new pens and the 1 new pen: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

First, Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10 to it. This means he now has a total of $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, we know that this sum of $30 tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to find the ages of Mary and Joan first.

We know that Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can find Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, we know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding them together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we multiply 0.3 by 1000, which equals 300 students. So, 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students: 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 3/5 by 700, which equals 420 students. So, 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students: 700 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John has 54 candies. We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. To find out how many candies Robert has, we need to divide the number of candies John has by 2.

Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, to find out how many candies James has, we add 6 to the number of candies Robert has.

James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, so Mike receives 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's find out how many minutes Jason used for his daily calls. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month. So, the total minutes used for daily calls is 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Next, we need to add the extra minutes he used to talk to other people, which is 300 minutes.

Now, let's add the total minutes used for daily calls and the extra minutes: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Finally, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Then, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

We're also told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium ""x"". The total number of fish is then 2x.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup. 

First, we need to find out how much it costs per day. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do each day, so the cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, the cost for 4 days a week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the cost for 4 days a week by 5 to get the total cost: $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount. To find the discount, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): $30,000 * 0.1 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to know the total weight of the onions and the cost per pound.

"Let's figure out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

We know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we multiply the number of cookies her sister ate by 4. So, 5 * 4 = 20 cookies.

Now, we know Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday. To find out how many cookies she ate on Tuesday, we multiply the number of cookies her sister ate by 2. So, 13 * 2 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Next, we add up the total number of cookies her sister ate: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total number of cookies Sue ate by 200 to find out how many calories she consumed: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

We do the same for her sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

Now, we subtract the number of calories her sister consumed from the number of calories Sue consumed to find the difference: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find out how many apps Travis has now, we need to subtract the apps he deleted and add the apps he downloaded. 

First, let's subtract the apps he deleted: 61 - 9 = 52
Then, add the apps he downloaded: 52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Let's break down the problem. Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's start with the cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars today than last night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. So, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

To find the total number of wolves killed, we add the wolves from last night and today: 10 + 36 = 46.

To find the total number of cougars killed, we add the cougars from last night and today: 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we add the total number of wolves and cougars to find the total number of animals Rick killed: 46 + 27 = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find out which floor Bill is on, we need to do some math. We know he starts on the 3rd floor. Then, he rides the elevator up to a floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

First, we multiply 3 (his starting floor) by 4. That's 3 * 4 = 12. 

Next, we add 6 to that result. So, 12 + 6 = 18.

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to figure out how many times Anne went down the slide first. 

We know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we multiply 0.3 by 30, which is 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break this down step by step. We know that Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls.

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Now, we know each stall initially had 20 cows. So, after Mr. Sylas added the new cows, each stall had 20 + 4 = 24 cows.

We want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. To do this, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 192 cows

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill.

First, let's start with the pennies. Since there are 100 pennies and each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 100 by $0.01 to get the total value of the pennies. This is equal to $1.

Next, we have 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so we multiply 40 by $0.05 to get the total value of the nickels, which is $2.

Then, we have 20 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so we multiply 20 by $0.10 to get the total value of the dimes, which is $2.

Finally, we have 40 dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is worth $1, we multiply 40 by $1 to get the total value of the dollar bills, which is $40.

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to know how many 10-foot sections it has. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add a flat fee.

First, let's find the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books that are overdue, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 8 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the books.

8 * $0.50 = $4.00

Now, we need to add the flat fee of $2.00. This fee is for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Next, we're told that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. This means he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. To find out how many bananas Andrea has, we divide the number of bananas Jamal has by 2. So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. This is 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

We can calculate this by multiplying 9,300 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Now, we divide 18,600 by 3 to find two thirds of 9,300.

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she already has to the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she has 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.

She then receives 20 marbles from her friend.

To find the total number of marbles, we add 250 and 20.

Total marbles = 250 + 20 = 270

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to figure out how many trees each of them has.

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to add up their individual amounts.

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply 0.05 by $350,000, which is $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply 0.12 by $350,000, which is $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000 is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's find the transfer fees. 3% of $400,000 is the same as 0.03 * $400,000. To find 0.03 * $400,000, we multiply 0.03 by 400,000. This equals $12,000.

Next, we need to find the brokerage fee. 5% of $400,000 is the same as 0.05 * $400,000. To find 0.05 * $400,000, we multiply 0.05 by 400,000. This equals $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee together to find the total fees. $12,000 + $20,000 equals $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price. $400,000 - $32,000 equals $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds. $368,000 - $250,000 equals $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, which is 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

In addition to the windows in the bedrooms, each house has 4 more windows. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

"To find the change, we need to add up the cost of all the items the mother bought. 

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. 

First, we add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry: $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65. 
Then, we add the cost of the pasta to that total: $13.65 + $1.35 = $14.00.

Now that we know the total cost is $14.00, we can find the change by subtracting that from the $20 the mother paid. 

$20 - $14.00 = $6.00

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to figure out how many stitches are used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The first scene has twice as many lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes. 

Next, we'll find the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"Let's say Mico's current age is M and Marco's current age is m. We know that their ages add up to 20, so we can write an equation: M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 years old, and Marco will be m + 10 years old. To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add their ages at that time: (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute 20 into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation: R = 6S, where R is Ruby's age and S is Sam's age.

In 9 years, Ruby will be R + 9 years old, and Sam will be S + 9 years old. We're also told that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second one: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. To find the total cost of the popsicles, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Next, let's find the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. To find the total cost of the ice cream bars, we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how much Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to figure out how many people she needs to buy for and then multiply that by the cost of each pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 15 people. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests. In total, Maddy needs to buy pizza for 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to figure out how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

Now, we need to find the length of the spaces between the gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. Each space is filled with a sterling silver bead that's 1/4 inch long. 

To find the total length of the spaces, we multiply the number of spaces by the length of each space: 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories written in the first week and the second week separately.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. So, the total number of stories written in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories. The total number of stories written in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week. So, 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we first need to determine his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly has left after buying a can of pop, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and dimes together: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we need to first calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 stars and 6 stars.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to know how much each truck can carry and how much each flagstone weighs. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the trucks can carry a total of 2000 pounds.

First, we need to find the total weight of all the flagstones. We can do this by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks to find out how many trucks are needed:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we need to know its speed. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is going 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is going 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. Given that it traveled 480 miles, we can plug in the values as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". Then, 10x = 39.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.

Finally, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to figure out how much time she actually works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she takes a break for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns money every 10 minutes, we need to convert 2.5 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's think about the fourth round. If a player has more than 20 points, they get an extra point. Mike has 21 points, which is not more than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is not more than 20, so he also doesn't get an extra point. Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know the oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest. To find the youngest son's age, we divide the oldest son's age by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now that we know the ages of both sons, we can determine how many oranges they washed. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. 

To find the total number of oranges washed, we add the number of oranges washed by each son: 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, we can find the number of oranges left unwashed by subtracting the total number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges bought: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and add them together.

Day 1: 
- Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 
- So, the total for Day 1 is 100 + 50 + 20 = 170.

Day 2: 
- He does 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups.
- He does 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats.
- He doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.
- The total for Day 2 is 120 + 40 + 40 = 200.

Now, we add the totals for both days: 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to know how much rice is consumed per day. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

"Let's figure out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

To find the total number of crates he sold, we add up all the crates he sold: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65.

Now, we need to find out how many crates he was off from his target. His target was 120 crates. To do this, we subtract the total number of crates he sold from his target: 120 - 65 = 55.

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to figure out how much money was bid in total. The initial bid was $200, and each time someone bids, the price goes up by $50.

There were 3 other people who bid, and Carmen bid after each of them. So, there were 3 bids from the other people, and then 3 bids from Carmen. That's a total of 6 bids.

We can think of this as a series of bids where the price keeps going up by $50 each time. We can use a formula to find the total cost. The formula is: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the total cost, n is the number of bids, a is the first bid, and d is the increase in price.

In this case, a = 200 (the first bid), d = 50 (the increase in price), and n = 6 (the total number of bids). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To find out how much John pays for driving to work each year, we need to do some math.

First, let's figure out how many miles John drives in a year. Since he goes to work and back each day, that's 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate how much he pays for driving. He gets charged $2 per mile, so 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000 per year.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, that's $150 * 12 = $1800 per year.

To find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

"To figure out how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's think about how the pages are arranged after folding.

Imagine you have a piece of paper and you fold it in half. Now you have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

For a 32-page tabloid, you can print the pages on these sides like this:

- The first page is on the left back.
- The second page is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until you reach the middle of the paper. Since there are 32 pages, the middle page is the 16th page. 

So, the first 16 pages are printed on one side of the paper, and the last 16 pages are printed on the other side. 

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, you need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 + 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

"Let's figure out how much money Elise earned in the second year.

We know that Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. This year, she sold 45 books. We also know that there are 50 books left unsold.

Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We can do this by subtracting the number of books sold this year, the number of books sold in the first year, and the number of unsold books from the total number of books.

Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to figure out how much he earns from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, and he works 5 days a week. So, he works a total of 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings are $500/week + $300/week = $800/week.

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to first figure out how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day, and two-thirds of them are sold in the morning. 

To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 3. 
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 3 = 40

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening.

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, this is not the question. The question is how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time, we need to multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4. 

4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks."
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the savings on the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's find the savings on the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"Let's figure out how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days.

The serum makes the person grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many extra arms the person will grow, we need to divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The serum also makes the person grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many extra legs the person will grow, we need to divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

"To find out how much money Theo has left to spend on gifts, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much money Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from the remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

This means Theo has $2050 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to first find the total number of eggs consumed in a day. 

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to figure out Jane's age first. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. So, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can find his age by dividing Cera's age at that time by 2. So, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

Now, we're told that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. To find the population, we multiply Noah's age by 3000: 20 * 3000 = 60000.

We're also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is twice the population six years ago. So, we multiply the population six years ago by 2: 60000 * 2 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the football team has 105 members in total. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D, and the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify this, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Now, let's combine like terms:

7D = 210

To find the value of D, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense."
"Let's figure out how many people are going to show up to Martha's party.

First, we need to find out how many people Martha invited in total. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, and 3 families with 4 people each. 

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they're sick. So, we subtract those from the total number of people invited.
24 - 8 = 16 people

But, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2, so 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5. 20 * 2 = 40, and 40 / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (like the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

First, let's find the number of girls. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we multiply 30 by 3 to get the number of girls:
Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we need to find the number of nongendered children. Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we multiply 30 by 1/10 to get the number of nongendered children:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left. Since there were 40 people initially, 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 people left the party.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Since 10 people left in total, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. If 7 women left, then the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to figure out how many ice cubes she needs to cool it down and how much cream she adds.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and she wants to cool it down by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes. 

65 / 13 = 5

So, she needs 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, she adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. 

To find the total weakening, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to figure out how many old records were traded for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records.

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to know how many junior and senior programmers there are, and how much they get paid.

First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since there are 100 employees in total, we can multiply 100 by 2/5 to find the number of junior programmers.

Number of junior programmers = 100 * 2/5
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's find out how much junior programmers get paid. We know that they get $2000 per month.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, let's find out how much senior programmers get paid. We know that they get $400 more than junior programmers, so they get $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Before that, 8 people got in at the second bus stop. So, at the second bus stop, there were 20 - 8 = 12 people on the bus.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second bus stop. So, before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

We also know that 5 people got on at the first bus stop. So, before that, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Since there were 14 people before the first bus stop, that means there were 14 people who got on the bus at the terminal.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Then, he eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to know how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 by 60.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to figure out how much they saved from their rewards and the coupon.

First, let's see how many rewards they got from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get a $1 reward. So, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they got: $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

Now, let's use these rewards on their current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their 4 rewards, which is $4 off the price.

Next, they used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they used $4 from their rewards, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the two job options. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, which is a total of $30,000 a year. However, we need to subtract the income tax, which is 20% of $30,000. That's $6,000, so the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but we have to subtract the property tax, which is $6,000. That leaves us with $36,000. Then, we need to subtract the income tax, which is 10% of $36,000. That's $3,600, so the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the two jobs. To find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay, we need to subtract the lower net income from the higher net income. So, $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 is the same as 0.4 multiplied by 220. 

0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. So, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. So, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. To do this, we subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's find out how much sugar is needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar, we multiply 8 by 30 to get the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers. 8 x 30 = 240 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how much sugar is needed for 1 batch of fudge. Since each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar, we don't need to multiply anything, we just need 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to get the total amount of sugar Mason needs. 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. This means she has a total of 8 * $8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (which is the same as 100% + 50%). So, the new price is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

Now, the stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (which is the same as 100% - 25%). So, the new price is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Since Maria has 8 shares, we multiply the price after the second year by 8 to find the total value of all her shares. 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups ""x"". Since the third group has 10 fewer students, it has x - 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms to get:
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to get:
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3 to get:
x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the third group by subtracting 10 from x:
70 - 10 = 60

So, the third group has 60 students.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's use the variable C to represent the number of cows and the variable H to represent the number of chickens. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can write an equation: H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write another equation: H + C = 60.

Now, we can substitute the value of H from the first equation into the second equation. Since H = 2C, we can replace H with 2C in the second equation, resulting in 2C + C = 60.

Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60. To find the value of C, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us C = 20.

Now that we know the number of cows is 20, we can find the number of chickens by using the equation H = 2C. Substituting C = 20 into this equation, we get H = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. To find the total number of legs of the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by 2, which is 40 * 2 = 80. To find the total number of legs of the cows, we multiply the number of cows by 4, which is 20 * 4 = 80.

Finally, we add the total number of legs of the chickens and cows to find the total number of legs of all the animals: 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, which means they all weigh the same amount. We're told that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, so the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

Next, we're told that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

We're also told that the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container. We have the pink frog (50 pounds), the blue beetle (50 pounds), the green toad (50 pounds), the yellow snake (60 pounds), the red bird (30 pounds), and the container (20 pounds). 

50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies.

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."

"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they made per day when they made tractors.

The amount they made per day when they made tractors is 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day.

The amount they make per day now is 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they made per day when they made tractors is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month. Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the food cost per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we need to add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. So, the total cost per month is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

First, let's start with Monday's yoga class. It's 1 hour long.

On Tuesday, Peyton has a cooking class. This class lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 hours long.

On Wednesday, there's a cheese-tasting event that's half an hour long, which is 0.5 hours.

On Thursday, Peyton has a museum tour that's half as long as the cooking class. Since the cooking class is 3 hours, the museum tour is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours long.

Finally, on Friday, Peyton has 2 hours of errands.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. She also needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots. 

So, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to figure out how much money she had left after buying the sweater and giving her brother money.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then, she gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

Since Andrea had $21 after buying the sweater and giving her brother money, we need to find out how much she had before that. To do this, we can subtract $21 from the initial amount of $36.

$36 (initial amount) - $21 (amount after spending and giving money) = $15

So, Andrea saved $15."
"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to figure out the total time he spent on his vacation. 

First, let's calculate the time he spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, in total, he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours on boating and swimming.

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. So, he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, we know that the time he spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's call the total time 'x'. Then, 30% of x is 6 hours. We can write this as an equation: 0.30x = 6. To find x, we divide both sides by 0.30: x = 6 / 0.30 = 20.

Now that we know the total time is 20 hours, we can find the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. This is 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work. To find her total earnings from this job, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work. To find her total earnings from this job, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, we add her earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. 
The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he received plus the extra $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially received $28 and got an extra $10, so he now has $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. We need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 25 cents is equal to $0.25.

Now, we can find the total cost of 4 lollipops by multiplying the cost of one lollipop by 4.
4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Next, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Billy starts with $10. He buys some candy that costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the amount of candy he buys 'x' pounds. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

After buying the candy, Billy has 10 - 1.5x dollars left. He then takes half of this amount and spends it on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. Since he buys 40 gumballs, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he takes half of his change, the amount he spends on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. We know that this amount is equal to $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's figure out how old Carver's son is. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his son is 5 years younger than twice Carver's age. 

We can write this as an equation: 2x - 5 = 45, where 'x' is the son's age. To find 'x', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. 

First, let's add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
This simplifies to: 2x = 50

Now, we need to get rid of the 2 that's being multiplied by 'x'. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 2x / 2 = 50 / 2
This simplifies to: x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to know the total distance it travels in one day and the distance it needs to travel before needing service.

First, let's find the total distance the train travels in one trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (since 175 - 50 = 125). 

So, the total distance in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance it travels in a day.

18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time John took for the trip, we need to calculate the time it took for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 210 miles. We can use the same formula to find the time it took for this part of the trip.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both parts of the trip to find the total time.

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home
Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"

Number of absent girls = 5
Number of absent boys = 4

Total number of students absent = 5 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 9
Number of students present = Total number of fourth-graders - Total number of students absent
= 96 - 9
= 87

Number of girls present = Total number of girls - Number of absent girls
= 43 - 5
= 38

Number of boys present = Number of students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38
= 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many points Jane needs on her third test, we need to subtract the points she's already scored from the total points she needs.

She needs a total of 42 points to pass, and she's already scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. 

First, let's add up the points she's already scored: 15 + 18 = 33

Now, we subtract the points she's already scored from the total points she needs: 42 - 33 = 9

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, we're told that 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. To find out how many were kicked out for shoplifting, we multiply 3 by 4 and then subtract 5.

3 * 4 = 12
12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting. Now, we're told that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. To find out how many were kicked out for physical violence, we multiply 7 by 3.

7 * 3 = 21

Now we know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks, 7 for shoplifting, and 21 for physical violence. We're told that a total of 50 people were kicked out. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of people kicked out for the other reasons from 50.

3 + 7 + 21 = 31
50 - 31 = 19

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Erin has 14 points now, and she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points she had in total before she got the 14 points. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's total points by multiplying Sara's points by 3. 

Sara's points = 8 
Erin's total points = 3 * Sara's points 
Erin's total points = 3 * 8 
Erin's total points = 24 

Now, we know that Erin's total points include the 14 points she has now. To find out how many points she had before, we need to subtract the points she has now from her total points. 

Erin's points before = Erin's total points - Erin's current points 
Erin's points before = 24 - 14 
Erin's points before = 10 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and we need 44 of them. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's price, which is $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together. $880 + $176 = $1056.

We also need to add the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, and we have 44 seniors in total. One-fourth of 44 is 11. So, 11 seniors will receive cords, and each cord costs $12. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, let's add the cost of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords together. $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, they sold 14 * 2 = 28 shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 28 = 56 shoes.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 56 / 2 = 28 shoes.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. This leaves us with 28 - 12 = 16 shoes.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100 shoes.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
The value of the faulty pieces is 40% of $400,000. To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4).

0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total milk collected, we need to calculate the milk from half of the sheep and the other half separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the milk from half of the sheep. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 15 sheep. The milk from these 15 sheep is 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.

Now, let's find the milk from the other half of the sheep. Again, half of the 30 sheep is 15. The milk from these 15 sheep is 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves together: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. So, she had 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces of rolls.

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to figure out how many like blue and green first. Since half of the class likes blue, that's 20 pupils.

Now, we have 40 - 20 = 20 pupils left. One-fourth of these 20 pupils like green, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

So, in total, 20 + 5 = 25 pupils like blue or green. To find out how many like yellow, we subtract this from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

First, let's find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. We know she sold all the apples picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples, we divide the total amount of money by the price per apple:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

10 pairs of socks is equal to 10 x 2 = 20 socks. 
Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we subtract the number of socks Lindsay has washed from the total number of socks. 
50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to add the number of cookies she initially bought and the number of cookies Janet gave her, then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

First, let's add the initial cookies and the cookies from Janet: 23 + 42 = 65

Now, we need to subtract the cookies eaten by her brother: 65 - 44 = 21

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest first. The formula for interest is Principal * Rate * Time.

The principal amount is $3,650, the interest rate is 10%, and the time is 5 months. 

First, we convert the interest rate to a decimal by dividing by 100: 10 / 100 = 0.10

Now, we multiply the principal, rate, and time: $3,650 * 0.10 * 5 = $1,825

This is the total interest. To find the total amount Karan has to pay, we add the interest to the principal: $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay the same amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $5,475 / 5 = $1,095

So, Karan has to pay $1,095 per month."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

"To find out how much profit Millie makes per hour, we need to know how much money she makes in total and then divide that by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's figure out how much money she makes in total. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total amount of money she makes is 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 on supplies.

So, her total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Next, we need to find out how many hours she spends selling the lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups to sell. To find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups she sells per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find out her profit per hour by dividing her total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can do this by setting up an equation.

Let's say the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can write this as:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we first need to figure out how many girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this by multiplying 52 (the total number of choir members) by 0.5 (which is the same as 50%).

52 * 0.5 = 26

So, there are 26 girls in the choir. Now, we know that half of the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means that half of the girls can't make it, which is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we need to find out how many people are performing. We know that 13 girls can't make it, so the number of girls performing is 26 - 13 = 13. Then, the 3 teachers join in, so the total number of people performing is 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. 

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to figure out how many popsicles each of them has. We know that the ratio of their popsicles is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together: 5 + 6 = 11. This is like having 11 equal groups of popsicles.

Now, we divide the total number of popsicles by the number of groups: 165 ÷ 11 = 15. This means each group has 15 popsicles.

Since the ratio of Betty's popsicles is 5, we multiply 5 by 15 to find out how many popsicles she has: 5 * 15 = 75.

Similarly, since the ratio of Sam's popsicles is 6, we multiply 6 by 15 to find out how many popsicles he has: 6 * 15 = 90.

Now that we know how many popsicles each of them has, we can find the difference: 90 (Sam's popsicles) - 75 (Betty's popsicles) = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Tim is canceling his cable subscription and getting streaming services instead. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Then he gets Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each. But, if he gets both, he gets a 20% discount.

First, let's find out how much he saves with the discount. 20% of $20 (the cost of both services) is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, he saves $4 by getting both services together.

Now, let's find the total cost of the streaming services. He pays $10 for Netflix and $16 for Hulu and Disney Plus (since he gets a $4 discount). So, the total cost is $10 + $16 = $26.

To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package. He was paying $60 for the cable package, so he saves $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find out what percentage of her total work time Carol spent editing, we need to know how much time she spent on each part of the process. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since she spent half that much time recording it, she spent 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording. 

We need to convert the time she spent editing from minutes to hours. 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time she spent on each part: 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

So, Mark has to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to figure out how many millipedes and stink bugs there are.

First, we know there are 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3 of the number of spiders. To find 1/3 of 90, we divide 90 by 3. 90 divided by 3 is 30, so there are 30 millipedes.

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. We know it's equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Twice the number of millipedes is 2 * 30 = 60. Then we subtract 12 from that, which is 60 - 12 = 48. So, there are 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs. 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168.

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. 

Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, and the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. So, the total amount of flour required is 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so we need to divide 12 cups by 2 cups to find out how many bags Mark needs to buy. 

12 / 2 = 6

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk, so the total amount of milk required is 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so we need to divide 4 cups by 2 cups to find out how many bottles Mark needs to buy.

4 / 2 = 2

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk

"To find out how much energy Mel saves, we need to first calculate how much energy he uses per day. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours a day, we multiply 900 watts by 8 hours to get the total energy used per day.

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), we can convert 7200 Wh to kWh by dividing by 1000.

7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he uses it for 3 hours a day. We multiply 900 watts by 3 hours to get the new energy used per day.

900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Converting 2700 Wh to kWh, we get:

2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

Now, we subtract the new energy used per day from the original energy used per day to find the energy saved per day.

7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There is one zebra with 36 stripes.
There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To figure out how much money Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese, we need to know how many sandwiches he needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide 20 by 4.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now that we know Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches, we need to find out how much meat and cheese he needs. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he needs 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house. To do this, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to figure out how many steps he completed before his jog. He walked to and from school, which is half of his daily goal of 10,000 steps. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"To figure out how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to know how long it will take him to read the book and then add the time it takes to get to the airport.

The book is 45 pages long and it's 200 words per page, so there are 45 * 200 = 9000 words in the book. Since Toby can read 300 words per minute, it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read the book.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so in total, Toby will be at the airport 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes after he finishes reading.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50 and the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then subtract the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to know how many cookies she eats in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 by 30:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog. If Marcy makes 50000 candles, then 5% of that is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles that smell like wet dog.

Now, we need to find out how many of those candles are the more dangerous ones that can explode. We know that 1% of the candles are more dangerous, so 1% of 50000 is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. This means that 5% of the 500 more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. To find that number, we multiply 5% by 500, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and can explode is 25."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Next, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We don't know how many apples Joanne gathers from the average trees, so let's call that number 'x'. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. We know there are 180 heads and 304 bumps. Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one hump.

Let's start by setting up two equations based on the information given. Let C be the number of camels and D be the number of dromedaries.

The total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation: C + D = 180.

The total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write another equation: 2C + D = 304.

Now, let's solve for C and D. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers every day, we multiply 200 by 4:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance he traveled in the next 2 days. He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:
800 km * 0.3 = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to figure out the elevation where the comb is. Since the comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's initial elevation of 10,000 feet, we subtract 4,000 from 10,000 to get the elevation of the comb.

10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, so we subtract 3,000 from 6,000.

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's figure out how much money Mr. Josue has now. 

First, he had $5000 in capital. Then, the first bank gave him $4000. After that, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks to find the total capital he has now. $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there were 50 cats on the rock. Then, four boats came and took away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat took: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30. This means there are 30 cats left on the rock.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years would be 2 * 12 = 24 months.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's call the cost of the tattered jeans ""T"" and the jogger jeans ""J"". We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's find the capacity of the buses. There are 4 buses that can hold 60 employees each, so the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we'll find the capacity of the minibusses. There are 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees each, so the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we'll find the capacity of the minivans. There are 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees each, so the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lillian has a total of 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, the homemade feeders must attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

To find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders, we multiply the number of homemade feeders by the number of birds each attracts: 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we find the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders by multiplying the number of store-bought feeders by the number of birds each attracts: 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item she ordered.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. So the soup costs 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5, so we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know the caterer prepared hotdogs for 36 guests. But, he prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs. That's 18 guests with two hotdogs each, which is 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. 

For the other half, he prepared one hotdog each, which is 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. So, in total, he prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That's 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs needed. But, there were only 54 hotdogs prepared. 

To find out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog, we need to find out how many hotdogs were missing. That's 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest needs one hotdog to have a second, 26 guests didn't get a second hotdog.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to add up the cost of all the items and then subtract the discount.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so that's 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is the discount. To do this, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20 (since 20% is the same as 0.20). So, 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find one-fifth of 150, we divide 150 by 5.

150 / 5 = 30

So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to figure out how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 3 gallons by 8 to get the total pints in one container.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which is 1/4 * 3 gallons. To find 1/4 of 3, we can multiply 3 by 0.25 (since 1/4 is the same as 0.25).

3 * 0.25 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to figure out how much money he spent on candy bars. 

First, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

Now, we know that George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is equal to $4.99.

Since George spent $1.20 on chips, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so to find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to divide the total amount he spent on candy bars ($3.79) by the cost of one candy bar ($0.75).

$3.79 ÷ $0.75 = 5.0533

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared. Since he kept 5 lollipops, we subtract that from the total number of lollipops he had.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends. There are 4 friends, so we divide 20 by 4.

20 / 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find out how much cake is left, we need to know how much cake was eaten by Rory and her mom. Since they each had a piece, we need to find out how much one piece weighs.

There are 8 pieces in total, and the cake weighs 20 ounces. To find the weight of one piece, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of one piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, they ate a total of 2 pieces. To find the total weight of the cake they ate, we multiply the weight of one piece by 2.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of one piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

First, let's find the cost of the onions. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients. The total cost is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break this down step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, it will take her 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Now, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier she should leave, we need to figure out how long it will take her to get to the theater and then subtract 5 minutes from that.

Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne. This means Bernadette needs to leave 11 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert the length to feet by multiplying 3 yards by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
To find the width, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes that occur.

First, let's think about the oven. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's think about the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. We add the temperature increase due to the oven (15 degrees) and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window (6 degrees). 

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to figure out his total time for the triathlon first. 

Jon's times are: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to start with Movie C. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply 1.25 by 60, which equals 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to 75 minutes to get the length of Movie B, which is 80 minutes.

Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4. 80 divided by 4 equals 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to figure out how far it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to get the distance: 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to know how many glasses she can make. Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 5.

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so in total, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can make: 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out: 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey has after his turn, we need to add the points he scored to his initial points. 

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

To find out how many points Marcy has after her turn, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's total points and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each. We multiply 6 by 8 to get 48.

Next, we find the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each. We multiply 4 by 16 to get 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If you buy a super ticket for $20, it includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. This means the total cost of the soda and popcorn together is $1. Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn must be the remaining amount after subtracting the soda's cost from the extra $1.

Let's call the cost of the popcorn 'x'. Then, the equation is:

x + 3 = 1

To find the cost of the popcorn, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 1 - 3
x = -2

However, the cost of popcorn can't be negative, so this doesn't make sense. Let's try a different approach.

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to figure out the cost of filling one balloon after the price hike.

Let's start by finding the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. If 20 balloons cost $900, we can divide $900 by 20 to find the cost of one balloon. 

$900 ÷ 20 = $45. This means that before the price increase, it cost $45 to fill one balloon.

Two days later, the price increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. To do this, we multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: $65 * 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the distance the car traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours. We can do this by multiplying the speed by the time: 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles.

Next, we'll find the distance the car traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour. Again, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles.

Now, we add the two distances together to get the total distance: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. 

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism (like a raised bed) is length * width * height. 

So, the volume of one bed is 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10 to get the total volume of soil needed: 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we divide the total volume by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs: 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, 20 minutes later, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Since half of 50 is 25, 25 more fairies joined the group.

Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

After 10 more minutes, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract 30 from 75.

75 - 30 = 45

So, there are 45 fairies remaining.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to know the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. We add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has.

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. We add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog to the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he's buying. 

First, let's start with the sugar cubes. He's buying 2 boxes, and each box weighs 1 pound, so that's 2 pounds total.

Next, he's buying carrots in 12-pound bags. He's getting 4 bags, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

Now, let's move on to the hay. He's buying 42 bales, and each bale weighs 75 pounds, so that's 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

Finally, he's buying oats in 65-pound sacks. He's getting 20 sacks, so that's 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 3400 / 2250 = 1.511. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number.

The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a month, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles.

First, let's find out how much she earns from the aluminum cans. She drinks 3 cans of soda a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, she earns 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week from the aluminum cans.

Next, let's find out how much she earns from the plastic bottles. She drinks 5 bottles of water a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, she earns 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week from the plastic bottles.

Now, we add the earnings from the cans and bottles to find out her total weekly earnings: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find out her total monthly earnings: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student gets.

First, let's find the total number of basketball cards. She has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, we find the total number of baseball cards. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to get the overall number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so to find the number of students, we divide the total number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student gets: 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. The total cost of the apples is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since she received a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost. So, Becky's total cost is 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100, which gives us $8.

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. The total cost of the apples is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. She received a 10% discount, which is 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. So, Kelly's total cost is 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100, which gives us $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost. $9 - $8 = $1.

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to start by calculating the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, we can multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student had.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find out how many pencils were used, we multiply the total pencils by 1/5.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total pencils to find out how many pencils were left after two months.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find out how many pencils were left, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3.

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If he wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. The number of cookies he gets is half of 'x' plus 2. So, the equation is:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to first find the combined length of the remoras. Since the remoras are 6 inches long, and there are 2 of them, we need to convert the length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet
2 remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first figure out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

We know she spent $300 on the books, and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one thing. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so if we just add those numbers together, we'd be counting those 3 kids twice.

To avoid this, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one thing. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the new price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to figure out how many tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. To find three-quarters of this weight, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

48 * 3 = 144
144 / 4 = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies. We add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny.

36 + 48 = 84

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn, we need to subtract the total amount they've already earned from their goal. 

First, let's add up the amount Keegan and Tasha have earned so far. Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.

Now, we need to subtract this amount from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need to earn. $200 - $174 = $26.

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Let's break it down step by step. We know that Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs each of them can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how much money Stetson gave up, we need to know how many oranges he ate. They picked 60 oranges in total, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them.

First, let's find 2/5 of 60. To do this, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide by 5. 

2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate, so we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 * $10 = $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to know how many miles he runs in a week and his speed. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. So, we multiply the miles he runs in a day by the number of days he runs in a week. 

Miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day. So, each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of one bag to find out how many bags are needed. 

200 / 50 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount. The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.

Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break this down step by step. We know that each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. To find out how many eggs can fit on the trays, we multiply the number of eggs per tray by the number of trays.

24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray. We know he has 64 eggs, and 48 eggs can fit on the trays. To find the number of eggs that won't fit, we subtract the number of eggs that can fit from the total number of eggs.

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much Sally spent in total, we need to know the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

The small pizza costs $8. To find the cost of the family-size pizza, we multiply $8 by 3.

$8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

$8 + $24 = $32

So, Sally spent a total of $32."
"To find out how much each individual razor will cost after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find out how many minutes Charisma walked, we need to figure out how many minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, we multiply 5 minutes by 8 hours to get the total minutes she walked in a day. 5 * 8 = 40 minutes.

Now, we need to multiply the minutes she walked in a day by the number of days she worked. She worked for 5 days, so we multiply 40 minutes by 5. 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find Angela's current age, we need to figure out how old she will be in four years and then subtract 4 from that number.

In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. 

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42. 

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find her current age, we subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the morning rides. Paul drives his car in the morning for 14 days, and each ride costs $6. So, the cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6 = $84.

Next, let's find the cost of the afternoon rides. Paul drives his car in the afternoon for 14 days, and each ride costs $2. So, the cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2 = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides together to get the total cost. $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so we can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's say Mark is planning a surprise party for his wife and he's trying to decide between two different venues. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, no matter how many guests show up. The second venue charges $25 per person, but it already includes food.

The first venue doesn't include food, so Mark estimates that it will cost $5 per person for food. We want to find out how many guests are needed for both venues to cost the same.

Let's call the number of guests 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to find the value of x:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for both venues to cost the same.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects together. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/4.

364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Now, let's find out how many yards her grandma used. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/2.

364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. There are 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, let's find the total number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. There are 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, we add the total number of gifts for both groups of friends: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for the friends: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to find the width of the rug first. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Suzie bought a total of 4 packs of gum. Two of them are strawberry gum, one is grape gum that costs $2, and one is green apple gum that costs half as much as the grape gum.

Since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, it costs $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can set up an equation to represent this: the cost of the strawberry gum (2 packs) plus the cost of the grape gum plus the cost of the green apple gum equals $7.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x. The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to figure out which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar. 

Let's compare the number of sticks he gets from each type of wood with the cost. A 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50. 

On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (we round down to 66 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first find the total number of snowshoes needed. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet saves by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to know how much she spends on bus trips in a week. Since she takes two bus trips a day and there are 5 days in a week, she takes a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips a week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.00.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep. We also know that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows. 

Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so it has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so it has a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to find out how many Sophia bought.

Let's say Sophia bought 'x' onions and 'y' potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can write the equation as:
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Simplifying the equation:
16 = 4x + 4y

Divide both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4

We can also set up another equation using the given information:
x + y = 4
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y
16 = 4x + 4y

However, we can simplify this problem by realizing that the total number of items Sophia bought is half of what Rose bought. Since Rose bought 16 items in total (12 onions + 4 potatoes), Sophia bought half of that, which is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To figure out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we need to know how many days he has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

Let's count the days from December 31st to July 19th. December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to know how much he earned in a week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned:
$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run and then multiply it by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since she has to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink. We know she needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, so we multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find out how much she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is the same as 0.2 * $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract that from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on CDs. 25% of $400 is the same as 0.25 * $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs. Now, we subtract that from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

So, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue. 

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. So, the total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, let's find the total revenue. She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Profit = total revenue - total cost = $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to know how long the fight lasted and how many punches he throws per minute. The fight is 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total time of the fight is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, we multiply the total time by the number of punches he throws per minute: 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to start with Suzanne, who made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we divide 36 by 4 to find out how many Josh made. 

36 / 4 = 9

So Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we know Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many Kelsie made, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $32."
"To find out how long it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first figure out how long it takes Rob. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert that to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now that we know Rob takes 120 minutes, we need to find out how long it takes Royce. We're told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we multiply Rob's time by 2 and then add 40 minutes. 

Double Rob's time is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to that gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, it takes Royce 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then add them together.

First, let's start with the hats. Since there are 3 children and each hat requires 2 skeins of wool, we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6 skeins.

Next, we move on to the scarves. Each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool, and there are 3 children, so we multiply 3 by 4 to get 12 skeins.

Now, let's calculate the number of skeins needed for the sweaters. Each sweater requires 12 skeins of wool, and there are 3 children, so we multiply 3 by 12 to get 36 skeins.

Moving on to the mittens, each pair requires 1 skein of wool, and there are 3 children, so we multiply 3 by 1 to get 3 skeins.

Lastly, we calculate the number of skeins needed for the socks. Each pair requires 2 skeins of wool, and there are 3 children, so we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins needed for each item: 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to figure out how many quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers have left, we need to subtract the number of loaves they sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's find out how many loaves they sold in total. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. So, the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked. The bakers baked 200 loaves and returned 6 loaves. So, the number of loaves left is 200 - 132 - 6 = 62.

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's find out how much Ada consumes in a week before adding the device. Since she uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and there are 7 hours in a day, we multiply 12 by 7 to get her weekly consumption: 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

Now, we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour, which is $1.50. So, 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Next, we need to find out how much Ada will consume in a week after adding the new device. The device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so we add 2 to her original consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Then, we multiply 14 by 7 to get her new weekly consumption: 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

Now, we multiply the new weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour: 98 * $1.50 = $147.

To find the difference in her weekly electric bill, we subtract the original cost from the new cost: $147 - $126 = $21.

"To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to first figure out how many days it would take for them to do so.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day because 5 people working together can do the job 5 times faster than one person.

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days because 2 halves make a whole.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Now, we're told that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has a total of 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has a total of 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

"Let's break it down step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and spent a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to figure out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

First, let's find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount he spent: $48 - $4 = $44. This is the amount he spent on the headphone set.

Now, let's find out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. We divide the amount he spent on the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 ÷ $4 = 11.

If he had spent the $44 on CDs instead of the headphone set, he could have bought 11 CDs. Since he actually bought 1 CD, we subtract 1 from 11 to find out how many more CDs he could have bought: 11 - 1 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

There are 6 weeks where Josh spent 4 hours. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

Then, there are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Lastly, there is 1 week where he spent 6 hours.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 people get off. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 8 from 48:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as got off (8) get into the bus. Since 5 times 8 is 40, there are 40 new people on the bus. Now, we add the people who got off and the people who got on:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

Now we're at the second stop. 21 people get off, so we subtract 21 from 80:
80 - 21 = 59

Next, 3 times fewer people get on. This means 3 times 21 is 63 fewer people get on. But since we're looking for the number of people who get on, we need to subtract 63 from 21. However, this would give us a negative number, which doesn't make sense. So, we actually need to add 63 to 21 to find out how many people got on:
21 - 63 = -42 (this is incorrect, we need to add 63 to 21) 
21 + 63 = 84

Now, we add the people who got off and the people who got on:
59 (left) + 84 (got in) = 143

The final answer is: 143"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years. This means that his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Let's find Jame's age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since he will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

To find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age, we subtract: 22 - 47 = -25. However, age can't be negative, so we take the absolute value of the difference: | -25 | = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how much one monitor costs. We know that Errol spent a total of $2,400 on a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer. The computer cost $1,100. We also know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find out how much the printer cost. Since the printer is $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now that we know the printer cost $700, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer by adding their costs together:
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total:
$2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
$600 / 2 = $300

So, one monitor costs $300."
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls.

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells more than the boys.

So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. This means if George had a certain number of candies, Nick had twice that number.

Let's say George had x candies initially. Then, Nick had 2x candies initially.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to determine Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Emma aims to make 72 vlogs per month. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. To find the total vlogs made so far, we add these numbers together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make: 72 - 54 = 18.

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much you paid, first, you need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill, which is $50. 

20% of $50 is the same as 0.20 * $50. Multiply 0.20 by $50 to get the tip amount.

0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

You ended up paying $60."
"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially got. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get the eldest boy's initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, the eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10 to his share, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13 left.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, we can call the amount he saves in the first half ""x"". Then, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2x.

The total number of days in April is 30, so the first half of the month has 15 days. This means Elvis will save x dollars for 15 days in the first half.

The total amount saved in the first half is 15x. The total amount saved in the second half is 2x * 15 (since there are 15 days in the second half).

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 2x * 15.

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 15x + 2x * 15 = 1125.

Simplifying the equation, we get 15x + 30x = 1125, which is 45x = 1125.

To find x, we divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount Elvis saves in the second half. Since he saves 2x in the second half, we multiply 2 by 25: 2 * 25 = 50.

So, Elvis needs to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's find the cost of the apples. She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, so the total cost of the apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we'll find the cost of the oranges. She bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so the total cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.

Now, let's find the cost of the peaches. She bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so the total cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now that we have the cost of each type of fruit, we can add them together to find the total cost. $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. 
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. 
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total.
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to figure out how many miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we need to multiply the miles he walks each day by the number of days he works. Jeff works 5 times a week, so the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break it down step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote initially, and the 13 letters she wrote next. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to figure out how much weight he lost in total and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so we multiply the weight he lost per month by the number of months:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first figure out how many toys are in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

First, let's find the cost of the notebooks. Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks at $1.50 each. So, the cost of the notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

Next, let's find the cost of the pens. Daniel wants to buy 2 pens at $0.25 each. So, the cost of the pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

Now, let's find the cost of the calculator. Daniel wants to buy 1 calculator at $12 each. So, the cost of the calculator is 1 * $12 = $12.

Finally, let's find the cost of the geometry set. Daniel wants to buy 1 geometry set at $10 each. So, the cost of the geometry set is 1 * $10 = $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30. 10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

First, we need to know how many cups of coffee Juan drinks. We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. 

Let's say the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We're told that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. So, x = 4. 

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor wants him to drink the daily recommended amount of 4 cups, we need to find out how many cups he needs to reduce his intake by. To do this, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

So, Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7, where x is his nephew's age today.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

First, let's look at the days he spent money on wooden action figures. He spent $5 each day for 4 days, so he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Now, let's look at the rest of the week. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, and each day he'll buy plastic action figures for $2. So, he can buy 50 / 2 = 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. 
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years, we need to figure out how much money she'll take out in total and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months. 

Since Katina takes out $100 every month, we multiply the number of months by the amount she takes out each month: 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount she took out from the initial amount in her account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they're selling 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments. 

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, so Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the cost of the materials and labor.

First, we find the area of the bedroom by multiplying the length and width. The length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet. The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The old carpet removal costs $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The new carpet installation costs $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the cost of the materials: $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (old carpet removal) = $3888.

Next, we add up the cost of the labor: $864 (old carpet removal) + $7344 (new carpet installation) = $8208.

Finally, we add the cost of the materials and labor to get the total cost: $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

The final answer is: $12196"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds seen = 280

Now, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average.

Number of days = 7

Average birds per day = Total birds seen / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

First, we start with a number, let's call it x, which is 20.

1. We find half of this number: x / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10.
2. Then, we add this half to the original number: x + (x / 2) = 20 + 10 = 30.
3. Next, we divide this sum by 5: 30 / 5 = 6.
4. Finally, we multiply this result by the original number minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we need to find the number of cards each of them has and add them together.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to figure out how much the oven is off by. We know that when she sets it to 450, it actually gets to 468. 

First, let's find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 is of 450. To do this, we divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100. 

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. 

This means the oven is off by 4%. Now, we need to find out what temperature she should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we need to find 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, we subtract 20.8 from 520. 

520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Since Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we round to the nearest whole number. The temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

First, let's find 30% of $76,000. To do this, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. 
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200. To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to know how many cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost, we need to figure out how many pairs Pete will have and how much he'll pay for them.

First, let's find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 contacts last 45 days, and he uses 2 contacts per day, we can find the number of pairs he uses per day:
90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he'll have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Now, let's find out how many days the contacts will last:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he'll use 2 contacts per day for 90 days, so he'll use a total of 180 contacts. This means he'll have 180 pairs of contacts.

Now, let's find out how much he'll pay for the contacts. Each box costs $100, and there's a 10% discount:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to know how many calories she burns in total. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour.

First, let's calculate the calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories. Then, we calculate the calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories. 

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many 200-calorie units there are, we divide the total calories burned by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100: 8 * 100 = 800.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.01B = 4500

Now, divide both sides by 3.01 to find the value of B: B = 4500 / 3.01 = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
Number of red jelly beans = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Number of green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30

"Let's break it down step by step. If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option. 

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds

Now, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in weight between the two options. To do this, we subtract the weight gained from the weight lost:
8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"To find out how many seats Alex needs, we need to figure out how many people are coming to the event. 

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people says they'll bring 2 friends, so that's 100 x 2 = 200 more people. That makes a total of 100 + 200 = 300 people from the email invites.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they're bringing their spouses. That's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Now, we add the people from the email invites and the people from Alex's friends. That's 300 + 18 = 318 people.

But we still need to count Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total. 318 + 1 = 319.

So, Alex needs 319 seats."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles in height, so it's now 4 * 2 = 8 feet tall.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles in height again, so it's now 8 * 2 = 16 feet tall.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles in height once more, so it's now 16 * 2 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation to represent this situation. Let's say Jerry's current age is 'x'. Then, his age 5 years ago would be 'x - 5'. Since he is twice as old now as he was 5 years ago, we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for 'x', we need to expand the equation. We do this by distributing the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses:

x = 2x - 10

Next, we want to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 'x' from both sides of the equation:

x - x = 2x - x - 10
0 = x - 10

Now, we add 10 to both sides of the equation to get:

0 + 10 = x - 10 + 10
10 = x

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to know how much he owes and how much he makes per hour.

First, let's find out how much he owes. Each implant costs $2000, and he needs 2 of them. So, that's 2 * $2000 = $4000. But he also wants a crown for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

However, he already paid a deposit of $600. So, we need to subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900. This is how much he still owes.

Now, we know he makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay off the remaining amount, we divide the amount he owes by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's say the smallest angle in the triangle is x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, we'll convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we'll convert the nickels to cents: 14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, we'll convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

"To find out how long it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to know its speed. We can find the speed by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took.

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the speed, we can find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. 
So, in 1 hour, Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
So, Marissa makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

First, let's find out how much money he made in the first 4 hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, in 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups of lemonade. The total amount he made in 4 hours is 60 * $0.50 = $30.

Next, let's find out how much money he made in the next 2 hours. He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups of lemonade. The total amount he made in 2 hours is 20 * $0.60 = $12.

Now, we add the money he made in the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours to find the total amount he made in 6 hours. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how long the tires will last, we need to know how many times they rotate in a month. Since the car rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can multiply that by the number of miles Jeremy drives in a month, which is 400 miles.

First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in a month. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know the tires can handle 10,440,000 rotations.

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we need to know how many pumps are in the bottle. The directions say that 2 pumps give 120 washings. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we need to convert the total cost to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the total cost in cents is 24 * 100 = 2400 cents.

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost in cents by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after buying the outfit, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.50. 

Now, let's subtract the discount from the price of the shirt to get the discounted price: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the price of the shorts, which is $35, to the discounted price of the shirt: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to add any additional tax. Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Joe has: $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50.

Since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means Joe doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.50"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we need to figure out how many croissants he wants to make and then multiply that by the amount of butter needed per croissant.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so he wants to make a total of 4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants.

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to get the total number of croissants: 28 * 12 = 336 croissants.

Now, we need to find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply 336 croissants by 1/4 pound. To do this, we multiply 336 by 0.25 (since 1/4 is the same as 0.25).

336 * 0.25 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to know the cost per meter and the length of both streets. 

Monica's street is 150 meters long and costs $194 per meter to repave. Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

First, let's find the cost to repave Lewis' street. We do this by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of the street: 194 * 490 = $95,060.

Now, we need to find the cost to repave Monica's street. We do this by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

The final answer is: $65,960"
"So, John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of his research. But his research takes 10 times longer than expected, which means it takes 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

Now, let's think about the funding. For the first 5 months, he gets $100,000. After that, the funding increases by 50% each month. So, for the next month, he gets $100,000 + 50% of $100,000, which is $150,000. 

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost for all 50 months. The first 5 months cost $100,000 each, so that's $100,000 * 5 = $500,000. 

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is $150,000 per month. So, that's $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, let's add the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

The final answer is: $7,250,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the amount eaten by each player. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to know how many days are in March. There are 31 days in March.

Each member of the Reddit group posts an average of 3 posts per day. Since there are 1000 members, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day to get the total number of posts per day: 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 3000 * 31 = 93,000 posts.

The final answer is: 93000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does laundry 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). 

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 52 * 20 = 1040 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is 1040 * $0.15 = $156.

The final answer is: $156"
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

First, let's start with the aquarium. It cost $10.00. 

Next, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each. So, 2 x $2.50 is $5.00.

Then, she bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each. So, 3 x $2.00 is $6.00.

After that, she bought 20 fish for $0.50 each. So, 20 x $0.50 is $10.00.

Finally, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and add the growth.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it was 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.
At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it was 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to know how much meat he sells in a day and how much meat the bull weighs.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, we multiply the amount of meat he sells per hour by the number of hours he works in a day: 15 * 10 = 150kg.

Now, we need to know how much meat the bull weighs. It weighs 750kg.

To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to start by finding the total number of seats. There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

Next, we know that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, we multiply the total number of seats by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, 72 / 4 = 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.

Now, we need to find the number of seats that were not occupied by the administrators. This is the total number of seats minus the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is 72 - 18 = 54.

Next, we know that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we multiply the remaining seats by 1/3, which is the same as dividing by 3. So, 54 / 3 = 18 seats were occupied by the parents.

Finally, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. This is the number of remaining seats minus the number of seats occupied by the parents, which is 54 - 18 = 36.

"To find out how many times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to figure out how many times each one can be played and then add those numbers together.

The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it can still be played 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it can still be played 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: 1509"
"So John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. He went twice a week, for 2 hours at a time. We need to find out how much it cost him.

First, let's figure out how many hours he went to physical therapy. He went 2 times a week for 6 weeks, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 times. And each time was 2 hours, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

Now, we know it costs $125 per hour. To find the total cost, we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to divide the total school hours by 2. Since he's at school for 8 hours, we divide that by 2.

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. 

Total pieces chewed so far: 4 + 2 = 6

He has 20 pieces initially, so we subtract the pieces he's already chewed: 
20 - 6 = 14

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so we need to divide 14 by 2: 
14 / 2 = 7

Jim's sister takes 7 pieces, so we subtract that from the remaining gum: 
14 - 7 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to first find out her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age:

9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. To find the total amount spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost per basketball:
8 x $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to know the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers that is, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing 20 by 1000:
20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply 0.02 Mb/s by 3600 s/h:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his required height and his current height, then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's find the difference between Adam's required height and his current height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference in height by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"So James sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each. First, we need to find out how much he got for the cars. That's 10 cars * $25,000, which is $250,000.

Next, the company paid 30% of that price to get the cars. To find 30% of $250,000, we multiply $250,000 by 0.3. That's 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we need to find out how much profit James made. To do that, we subtract the company's cost from the total price of the cars. So, $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James gets a 10% commission on the profit. To find 10% of $175,000, we multiply $175,000 by 0.1. That's 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

James made $17,500."
"To find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to figure out how many people in total can stay upright and then subtract the number of women from that.

First, we need to find 25% of 100, which is the total number of riders who can stay upright. To do this, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. To find the price of the gold Jewell, we multiply the price of the diamond Jewell by 4/5.

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. To find the price of the silver Jewell, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold Jewell.

Price of silver Jewell = $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of truck and rose stamps first.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

Now, we know he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. To find the number of rose stamps, we subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps: 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to know the speed of both of them and the distance between them.

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. The distance between them is 75 miles.

Since they are moving in the same direction, we need to find the difference in their speeds to determine how fast Tom is closing the gap. This is called the relative speed.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first figure out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can find Darren's total by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

So, Darren caught 11 fish. Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's total, we add 3 to Darren's total.

11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to figure out the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's start by finding the cost per class. Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60. 

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We can try different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's figure out how many customers Julie and Jewel can process in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, so she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. That's 50 * 2 = 100 customers per day.

To find Julie's weekly production, we multiply her daily production by 7: 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

Now, let's add up their weekly productions to find the total: 350 (Jewel's production) + 700 (Julie's production) = 1050 customers.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole first. The volume of a rectangular prism (like the hole) is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Depth = 3 feet

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now that we know the volume of the hole, we need to find out how long it takes Bob to shovel one cubic foot of earth. We're told it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot.

Time per cubic foot = 3 seconds

To find the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"So, let's figure out how much money Tim will make in a year. He gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary, which is a pretty good deal. To find out how much the raise is, we multiply 5% by $20,000. 

5% is the same as 0.05, so we multiply 0.05 by $20,000 to get $1,000. Now, we add that to his original salary to get his new monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

But that's not all - he also gets a bonus that's half of his monthly salary. Half of $20,000 is $10,000, so that's how much his bonus is.

Now, let's add his new monthly salary and his bonus to get his total monthly income: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

Finally, we multiply his total monthly income by 12 to get his total annual income: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

First, let's find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 / 5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 shirts per suit, and he bought 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is 20 * 28 = 560 articles.

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 * 28 = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 + 280 = 840 articles.

The final answer is: 840"
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to find the age of Steve's son first. 

Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, we subtract 3 from his age to find her age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion: 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa, we multiply her speed by the time she biked: 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

To find the total distance biked by Stanley, we multiply his speed by the time he biked: 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

Now, we add their individual distances to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil per hour. Since he has to dig through 24 feet of soil, we divide 24 by 4 to get the time: 24 / 4 = 6 hours.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so he digs 4 / 2 = 2 feet of clay per hour. Since he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, we divide 8 by 2 to get the time: 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to figure out the total number of people he's buying for. This includes himself, his teacher, and all his classmates. 

There are 25 classmates, and we need to add Howie and his teacher to that number. So, the total number of people is 25 + 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) = 27.

Since Howie wants to get one of each flavor for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2. 

27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio posted a selfie on Instagram and got 2000 likes initially. After three weeks, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, we need to find the total number of likes after Fishio received 20000 more new likes. To do this, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after three weeks.

Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on the first day. But she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 * $20 = $400
Then, we subtract the $2 discount:
$400 - $2 = $398

The next day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Clara bought 20 pomegranates again. First, we calculate the total cost without the discount:
20 * $30 = $600
Then, we find the discount, which is 10% of $600:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the cost of the first day from the cost of the second day:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Ariadne's sales from red hats in a particular month were $400. We also know that this is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats ""x"". Since $400 is half of x, we can write the equation x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us x = $400 * 2 = $800. So, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in the first month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find this, we multiply $1200 by 3/4. This gives us $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for the hours from 6 PM to 9 PM.

There are 3 hours from 6 PM to 9 PM. The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's figure out how much money was withheld from Sally's wage. 

We know that Sally's bank account started with $200 at the beginning of the week. Now it has $420. We also know that her weekly wage should be $300. 

To find out how much money she should have in her account, we add her initial amount to her expected wage: $200 + $300 = $500.

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we need to find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld. 

$500 - $420 = $80

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To figure out how many eggs Lori needs, we need to know how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs she needs to make 48 deviled egg halves. We divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to figure out what 2/3 of 15 is. 

First, let's find 1/3 of 15. To do this, we divide 15 by 3. 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, 1/3 of 15 is 5.

Now, we need to find 2/3 of 15. Since 1/3 of 15 is 5, 2/3 of 15 would be 5 + 5, which is 10.

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the plane, we need to add up the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel.

The plane costs $150,000. 

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice. We're also told that it took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, to find the cooking time for the pork, we add 20 minutes to the cooking time for the rice. That's 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Next, we're told that the beans took half the combined cooking time of the pork and the rice. To find the combined cooking time of the pork and the rice, we add their individual cooking times together: 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes, so it took Finley 40 minutes to cook the beans.

Now, we need to find the total cooking time for all the food. We add up the cooking times for the rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then add them together.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of animal legs is 70 and the total number of animal heads is 20. Since Lee only rears sheep and geese, we can use this information to find the number of sheep.

Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write an equation for the total number of legs: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of heads is 20, so we can write another equation: S + G = 20.

Now, let's solve for G in the second equation: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.2, which is $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to know how much Gus spent in total and subtract the cost of the other items he bought.

Gus bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.
He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.

Let's add up the cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we know Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the $20.00: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's start by adding the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
198 (District A) + 209 (District C) = 407

Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of newspapers delivered:
600 (total) - 407 (District A and C) = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to figure out how much time he spends in class and then divide that by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, we multiply 4 by 2 to get the total hours per week, which is 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, we multiply 8 hours by 6 to get the total class time, which is 48 hours.

Now, we know John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by 1.5 hours. 

48 hours / 1.5 hours = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many math teachers are on the court, we need to figure out how many history teachers there are first. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this as follows:

60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150
= 90

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. To find out how much Kassidy has, we multiply 120 by 3/4. 

3/4 * 120 = 90

So, Kassidy has $90. Now, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. To find out how much Rayna has, we add 60 to 90.

90 + 60 = 150

Now, we have the amount of money each person has: Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has $90, and Rayna has $150. To find out how much each person would have if they shared their money equally, we need to add up the total amount of money and divide it by 3.

Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360
Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120

The final answer is: $120"

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought. 

First, let's find the cost of type A candies. There are 7 candies of type A, and each one costs $0.5. So, the total cost of type A candies is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.

Next, let's find the cost of type B candies. There are 10 candies of type B, and each one costs $0.75. So, the total cost of type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

Now, we add the cost of type A candies and type B candies to find the total cost of the candies. $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Since Adam paid $15, we need to subtract the total cost of the candies from $15 to find the change he got. $15 - $11 = $4.

"Let's break down Christina's mood records. We know that she had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.

We're left with 30 - 24 = 6 days. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, which accounts for 3 days. This leaves us with 6 - 3 = 3 days.

However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in total. Since the first 8 days and the last 3 days were good, that's 8 + 3 = 11 good days. This means there are 12 - 11 = 1 good day left in the month.

"Let's solve the problem. We know that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Sally has.

Let's call the number of books Sally has 'x'. Then, the number of books Janey has is 2x + 3, because it's twice the number of books Sally has plus 3 more.

Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can write the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the 3 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, we need to get 'x' by itself. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. Then, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This means there are a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. Adding this to the initial 12 toys, James needs a total of 12 + 28 = 40 toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means James needs 40 - 3 = 37 toys in total.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to figure out how much money was left after Dylan and Frances invested.

First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of $1200. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 1200. 

2/5 * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

So, Dylan invested $480. Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment. We subtract 480 from 1200.

1200 - 480 = 720

Now, we know that Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find out how much Frances invested, we multiply 2/3 by 720.

2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

So, Frances invested $480. Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment. We subtract 480 from 720.

720 - 480 = 240

This means that Skyler's investment is $240.

"To find out how much the elevator will exceed its maximum load, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults riding it. 

First, we need to find the total weight of the 9 adults. Since each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Now, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to figure out how much was added to it. We know the final length is 140cm, and 20cm of that is from the lace trim. So, the extension is 140 - 20 = 120cm.

Since the extension is 50% of the original length, we can set up an equation: 0.5x = 120, where x is the original length.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.5: x = 120 / 0.5.

x = 240.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it took for each mode. We know that Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, which is 60 minutes. In ""rabbit"" mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to get to the fire station. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and then another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time to get to the fire station from the total time they have. Total time they have = 30 minutes, time to get to the fire station = 19 minutes. 

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the apples. 1 kilo of apples costs $4.

Next, we'll find the cost of the bananas. Since she bought 2 kilos of bananas and each kilo costs $2, the total cost of the bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.

Now, let's find the cost of the oranges. She bought 2 kilos of oranges, and each kilo costs $3, so the total cost of the oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Let's figure out how many cookies are left in the box. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta. So, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We know that the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44, so we can write the equation: T + (T+7) + t = 44

We also know that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet, so we can write another equation: T+7 = t+7

Simplifying the second equation, we get T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin. 

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to know the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies. $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4. $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. 

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"So John goes to the vet with his dog. The vet says his dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. John brought $125 with him.

First, let's find the cost of the vaccines. There are 2 vaccines at $20 each, so that's 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know it's 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, let's find the number of blue squares. We know there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares. So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, we find the number of green squares. We know there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, and there are 18 blue squares. So, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, we find the number of white squares. We know there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, and there are 24 green squares. So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now that we have the number of each color of squares, we can add them together to find the total number of squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia's restaurant has, we need to know that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to know how many chairs are needed in total. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so we add those together.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs needed

Mia already has 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so we add those together to find out how many chairs she already has.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the number of chairs she needs.

57 chairs needed - 48 chairs available = 9 more chairs needed

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to first find the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we multiply 50 by 0.5 (which is the decimal form of 50 percent). 

50 * 0.5 = 25

Now that we know there are 25 bucks, we need to find 20 percent of that number. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20 percent).

25 * 0.2 = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. To find Tom's points, we subtract 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Martha's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Each of her children has 3 children of their own, making a total of 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, which are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies. 

So, we multiply the number of grandchildren by the number of great grand-babies each has: 9 x 3 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to figure out how much she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her pay into it. 50% is the same as 0.5, so we multiply 0.5 by $2400.00. That's 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this. 20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 0.2 by $2400.00. That's 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display: 120 + 15 = 135.

"Let's figure out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Now, we know that when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. So, the capacity of Gary's truck is 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. To find the total number of people, we add the number of males and females together: 8 + 6 = 14.

Next, we're told that each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, we multiply 6 by 3 to find the total number of dumplings eaten by females: 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. So, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by males, we multiply 8 by 4: 8 * 4 = 32.

To find the total number of dumplings eaten by everyone, we add the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry must be equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy, we need to know the deal and the price of each scoop. The deal is buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, and each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's see how much 2 scoops cost. Since each scoop is $1.50, 2 scoops will be 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.

Now, Erin has $6.00, and she can get 2 scoops for $3.00. This means she can buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops.

The remaining money Erin has is $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00. She can use this money to buy 2 more scoops, but since each scoop costs $1.50, she can only buy 1 more scoop with the remaining money.

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream with the deal and 1 more scoop with the remaining money, making a total of 4 scoops.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James has to pay $20 to go blueberry picking, and then it costs him $1.5 per pound of blueberries he picks. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

First, we need to find out how much it costs James to pick the blueberries. We do this by adding the initial cost to the cost per pound multiplied by the number of pounds. So, the total cost of picking blueberries is $20 + ($1.5 * 30).

To find the total cost of picking, we multiply $1.5 by 30, which is $45. Then we add the initial cost of $20, making the total cost $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's find out how much it would have cost James to buy the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. So, the total cost at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we need to subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store. So, $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

First, 100 people apply for a job at Google. Then, 30% of them get an interview. To find 30% of 100, we multiply 0.3 by 100, which is 30. So, 30 people get an interview.

Next, 20% of those who get an interview get a job offer. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 0.2 by 30, which is 6. So, 6 people get a job offer.

Finally, a third of those who get a job offer accept the position. To find a third of 6, we divide 6 by 3, which is 2. So, 2 people accept the position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to know how many sacks she gave away in total. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to compare the number of boxes she bought in both weeks.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. To find the total number of boxes she bought this week, we add 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of boxes she bought this week and last week. To do this, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

First, let's find the total number of taps when Helga's arms are down. Her right foot taps 300 times per minute, and her left foot taps 250 times per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550. Since she dances with her arms down for 3 minutes, the total number of taps is 550 * 3 = 1650.

Next, let's find the total number of taps when Helga's arms are up. Her right and left feet both tap 200 times per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400. Since she dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.

Now, we add the total number of taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"So, let's figure out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. If he doesn't fix it, it's going to cost him $450 in damages to his car. But, if he does fix it, the city council will fine him $120 for doing it himself. He'll also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each one costs $25. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt. 3 buckets of asphalt will be 3 x $25, which is $75. Now, we add the fine to that, which is $120 + $75 = $195. 

Now, we subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the damage it will cause: $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, we need to subtract these from the total.

First, let's find the total number of chairs sent for repair: 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Now, let's subtract the total number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs: 170 (normal) + 23 (baby) = 193

193 - 33 = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to figure out how many slices were eaten in total. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and the other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people. We know each pizza has 12 slices, so we multiply 5 people by 2/3 and 12 slices:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people to find the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices

Since there were 60 slices in total (5 people * 12 slices/person), we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to multiply the time the cat takes by 2/3. 

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. 

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 feet by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the total number of windows from students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's find the total number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we multiply 256 by 1/4. To do this, we can multiply 256 by 1 and then divide by 4. 256 * 1 = 256, and 256 / 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the total number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashed three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows, we multiply 64 by 3/4. To do this, we can multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4. 64 * 3 = 192, and 192 / 4 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to first find the total number of blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. We have 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00, we need to figure out how many people voted by then. 

First, 2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday. To find 2/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 2 and then divide by 5. 
5000 * 2 = 10000
10000 / 5 = 2000

So, 2000 people voted by midday. That leaves 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people who hadn't voted yet.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find 2/3 of 3000, we multiply 3000 by 2 and then divide by 3.
3000 * 2 = 6000
6000 / 3 = 2000

This means 2000 more people voted by 16:00. So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (from midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000.

Now, to find the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of people.
5000 - 4000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 / 3 = 1.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

First, let's find the total weight of her math books. Since she has 2 math books and each weighs 2 pounds, the total weight of her math books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Next, we know her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

We also know that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, her history book weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all her books: 4 (math) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to figure out how many votes candidate B got first. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5, which is 10. Then we add that to 20, so 20 + 10 = 30 votes for candidate B.

Now, we know that candidate A and B got a total of 20 + 30 = 50 votes. Since there are 100 voters in total, candidate C must have gotten the rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we need to subtract 23 from 100 to find out how many apples Beck has.

100 - 23 = 77

So, Beck has 77 apples. Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find out how many apples Beck has now, we add 10 to 77.

77 + 10 = 87

Now, we need to find out how many apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck. We subtract 10 from 100.

100 - 10 = 90

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount.

90 - 87 = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can find out how many books Steven has by dividing Clara's total by 2. 

Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, we add 6 to Steven's total to find out how many books Alice has.

Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total.

Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 
The total cost of 10-gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.
The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together. 
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that there are 50 students in the class. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

We're also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, 2 times that is 10 students who like to play music.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or music. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is the difference between the total number of students who like to play video games or music and the number of students who like to play music.

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - Students who like to play music
= 35 - 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

"Let's say there are x votes against the new regulation. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there are against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is 33, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to determine the number of students for each size and add them together.

First, we know that 11 students need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium shirts. So, we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students.

Then, we find that half as many students need large shirts as size medium. We divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students.

Finally, we're informed that six more students need extra-large shirts than large. So, we add 6 to 9 to get 15 students.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the price after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find 5% of $140. To do this, we multiply $140 by 0.05.

$140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price.

$140 - $7 = $133

So, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the length of each song in hours.

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists: 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours.

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"Let's break it down step by step. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.2 by 50, which equals 10 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people are left. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, we subtract 10 from 50, which gives us 40 people left.

Next, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 0.6 by 40, which equals 24 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people are left after 24 people think horse #7 will win. We subtract 24 from 40, which gives us 16 people left.

These 16 people think horse #12 will win the big race.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister.

Jayden initially had $70. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of cases of shingles needed: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much they spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and add them together.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total is 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total is 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add their totals together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the total number of fruits George has, we need to first find out how many pears he has. Since he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 90 (pears)
Total number of fruits = 290

The final answer is: 290"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the money she had and then divide the remaining amount by the cost of each candy bar.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar, which is $5. So, $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is: 12"
"To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs to know how many kilograms of oranges he needs. Since he needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he will need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost will be 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break it down step by step. We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. Since he read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed must have read half the number of books Ezra read. 

To find out how many books Ahmed read, we divide 300 by 2. 300 / 2 = 150. So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we know Ezra is going to read 150 more books. To find out how many books he will have read in total, we add 150 to 300. 300 + 150 = 450.

To find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read, we add the number of books each of them read. 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books) = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches only 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents. Since they have 4 vanilla scents available, they sold a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents.

The company sold 2 fruity scents. Since they have 8 fruity scents available, they sold a total of 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from the corn, we subtract the amount he already makes from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: $135 - $60 = $75.

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear for. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out what percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to know how much time she has available and how much of that time she spends playing soccer.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so she has a total of 12 hours for the weekend.

She spends 3 hours reading, which leaves her with 9 hours of free time. Since she spends 1/3 of her remaining time playing video games, we need to find 1/3 of 9 hours. To do this, we multiply 9 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 9 by 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3, so she spends 3 hours playing video games.

Now, we subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total free time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer. 9 hours minus 3 hours is 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time she spends playing soccer by her total weekend time and multiply by 100. 6 hours divided by 12 hours is 0.5, and 0.5 multiplied by 100 is 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   To find 3/5 of 25, we multiply 25 by 3 and then divide by 5.
   25 * 3 = 75, and 75 / 5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to figure out how long it takes him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to drive to the museum. We know the distance is 150 miles and he drives at 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since he has to drive back home, it will take him another 2 hours. So, in total, it takes him 2 + 2 = 4 hours to drive to the museum and back.

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 + 6 = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels will be left, we need to know how many wheels Henry needs in total and how many he already has. 

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the toys. Henry has 57 cars and each car needs 4 wheels, so the total number of wheels for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228. He also has 73 motorcycles and each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so the total number of wheels for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146. 

Now, we add the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed: 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the price after the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is 0.20 x $1000 = $200.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into three parts: the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the peaches. Since Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches and they cost $2.00 per pound, we multiply 6 by 2 to get the total cost of the peaches. 6 * 2 = 12. So, the peaches cost $12.00.

Next, we find the cost of the plums. Winston picked 8 pounds of plums, and they cost $1.00 per pound. We multiply 8 by 1 to get the total cost of the plums. 8 * 1 = 8. So, the plums cost $8.00.

Now, we find the cost of the apricots. Winston picked 6 pounds of apricots, and they cost $3.00 per pound. We multiply 6 by 3 to get the total cost of the apricots. 6 * 3 = 18. So, the apricots cost $18.00.

To find the total amount Winston spent, we add the cost of the peaches, plums, and apricots together. 12 + 8 + 18 = 38.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's start by breaking down the scoring system. Ava and Emma receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries. However, she finishes the level 4 seconds slower. 

Let's assume Emma's score is x. Then, Ava's score can be broken down into three parts: the points from enemies, the points from berries, and the points from the timer.

Ava's enemy score is 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on, which is 10(x + 8). 
Ava's berry score is 5 times the number of berries she collects, which is 5(x + 3).
Ava's timer score is 30 times the number of seconds left on the timer, which is 30(60 - (x + 4)).

Now, let's simplify Ava's timer score. 
30(60 - (x + 4)) = 30(56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

Now, we can add up Ava's scores: 10(x + 8) + 5(x + 3) + (1680 - 30x) = 10x + 80 + 5x + 15 + 1680 - 30x = -15x + 1775.

Emma's score is x.

The difference in their scores is (-15x + 1775) - x = -16x + 1775.

However, we don't know the value of x. We need to find the value of x to calculate the difference.

Since we don't have any information about the value of x, we can assume that the difference in their scores is the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (x + 4)) - 60 = -4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's break it down step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. 

First, we need to find the total cost of these two pizzas. Since they cost 30 dollars each, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the total cost of these two pizzas.

2 pizzas * 30 dollars = 60 dollars

Now, we need to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. We know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas.

64 dollars (total cost of all pizzas) - 60 dollars (cost of two known pizzas) = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 dollars / 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He bought some more fish from the pet store, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is W. Since the total number of fish he bought is 17, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - W.

After adding the new fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - W), and the total number of white fish is 4 + W.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + 17 - W = 8 + 2W.

Combine like terms: 20 - W = 8 + 2W.

Add W to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3W.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3W.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to know how far he drives and how much gas his car uses per mile.

The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he drives this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we need to know how much gas his car uses per mile. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so it uses 1/10 gallon per mile. To find out how much gas it uses per week, we multiply the total weekly distance by the amount of gas used per mile: 50 miles/week * (1/10 gallon/mile) = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the amount of gas used per week by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by $0.25 to get the total value of the quarters. 

140 * $0.25 = $35

Now, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5.

10 * 3 = 30
30 / 5 = 6

So, she spent 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 6 by $20 to get the total value of the twenties she spent.

6 * $20 = $120

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent.

$35 + $120 = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of tomatoes. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, and each plant yields 22 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes is 5 * 22 = 110.

Next, let's find the total number of eggplants. Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants, and each plant yields 4 eggplants. So, the total number of eggplants is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together to find the total number of fruits. 110 + 32 = 142.

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

To find the number of smart TVs sold, we multiply 40 by 1/4: 40 * 1/4 = 10 TVs.

To find the number of analog TVs sold, we multiply 40 by 1/8: 40 * 1/8 = 5 TVs.

Now, we add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs to find the total number of these two types of TVs: 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to rise to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

First, we need to find the current temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder than during the day, and it was 45 degrees during the day. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find the difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. That's 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find the total number of seashells, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction that brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

First, let's find out how much she earns for the regular 8 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, we multiply 8 hours by $20. That's 8 * $20 = $160.

Now, let's find out how much she earns for the extra 3 hours. She gets paid 150% of her regular hourly rate for these hours. To find 150% of $20, we multiply $20 by 1.5. That's $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Now, we add the money she earned for the regular hours and the extra hours. That's $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.
We also know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, Mike wants to buy a pair of jeans that originally costs $40. He sees that they're 25% off, which means he'll get a discount of 25% of $40. 

To find the discount, we multiply 25% by $40. Since 25% is the same as 0.25, we multiply 0.25 by $40. 

0.25 * $40 = $10

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price after the discount.

$40 - $10 = $30

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he'll have left over, we subtract the price after the discount from the $50 bill.

$50 - $30 = $20

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they plan to sing it twice, so that's 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Now, we just need to add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" together. 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels. 

3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, let's find the difference in cost: $6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11. 

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of 278 is 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class.

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is twice the total number of teachers.

Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

"To find out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's find out how many hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, let's find out how many hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Now, we add the hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate how far each car travels in that time. 

The first car is going 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is going 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to see how far apart they are. 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold. 

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to add the 30% premium to the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3. 

0.3 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to figure out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to figure out the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add that to the amount of tea left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. 

Adding those two amounts together, we get 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea consumed.

Now, we know that there are 4 quarts in a gallon. So, to find out how many gallons of tea were consumed, we divide 38 by 4, which equals 9.5 gallons.

However, we're asked for the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party. We know that 38 quarts were consumed and there are 10 quarts left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide 48 by 4, which equals 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. To find out how many he has left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies: 100 - 150 = -50. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, we need to subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies to find out how many he still needs to sell: 200 - 150 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate how many times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

So, at the end of May, there are 160 students. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Felix made a total of $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. 

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked for 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have. First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows, so in total, they used 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

There were originally 35 marshmallows in the bag. To find out how many are left, we subtract the ones used and dropped: 35 - 21 = 14.

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how long each person played. Jack played for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Two of his friends are worse than him, so they played for half the time, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 

The other friend is better than Jack, so they played for 1.5 times the time, which is 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

To find the total amount of money used, we multiply the total time played by the cost per minute: 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar. We also know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, and twice as much oil as salt. Additionally, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the goats. John bought 3 goats for $500 each, so the total cost of the goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.

Next, let's find the cost of the cows. John bought 2 cows for $1500 each, so the total cost of the cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together to find the total amount of money John spent. $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add up the number of cupcakes Paul already has: 8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which is 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe gave away in total. He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars, so he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

So, Joe has 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first figure out how much money the students raised in total. The charity raised a total of $175,000, but $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students must have raised the rest, which is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to figure out how much he makes in a day first. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. Each task pays $1.20.

So, let's multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks and the pay per task to find his daily earnings.

Daily earnings = 30 cycles * 5 tasks * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = 150 tasks * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = $180

Now, we need to multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find out how much he makes in a week.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we need to figure out how many points she scored in each game and then add them together.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

Now, let's think about the second game. Sasha struggles during away games, and in this game, she was at Julie's home court. We know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie scored in the first game. 

First, we need to find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, and Sasha scored 14 points, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Now that we know Julie scored 10 points in the first game, we can find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package. There are 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we find the total number of tins of dog food by multiplying the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package. There are 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food. To do this, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Then Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards. The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, so we can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to figure out how many of each color she had. 

First, let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 of those. 

Next, we know she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, if she had 5 green eggs, she must have had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Now, let's move on to the pink eggs. We know she had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Since she had 10 blue eggs, she must have had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, we need to find out how many yellow eggs she had. We know she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, if she had 9 pink eggs, she must have had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now that we know how many of each color of eggs Cindy had, we can add them together to find the total number of eggs. 

5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles. So, the total cost of shipping is (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99.

Next, we need to find out how much Milly will get back from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is 0.75 * 32 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"Let's break down Mulan's expenses. She initially had $40. Her dad gave her $100, so now she has a total of $40 + $100 = $140.

Mulan bought two pairs of jeans for $30 each, which is a total of 2 * $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20.

To find out how much she spent, we add the cost of the jeans and the bag: $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to figure out how much he produces in the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars. 

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week. She spends 2 hours on this, which is 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time she spends on makeup. She does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week. So, that's 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends recording videos. She records 18 videos per week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, that's 18 x 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends on TikTok per week: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To make it easier to work with, let's convert the total weekly time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 282 minutes is 282 / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Finally, let's multiply the weekly time by 4 to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find out how much Angela will pay, we need to break down the costs. The interior design firm charges $129.00 for the initial installation, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. We need to find out how many of each item she needs to pay extra for. 

For the mirrors, she has 6, but the initial installation already includes 4, so she needs 2 more. The cost for each additional mirror is $15.00, so 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

For the chandeliers, she has 2, but the initial installation already includes 1, so she needs 1 more. The cost for each additional chandelier is $15.00, so 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

For the pictures, she has 20, but the initial installation already includes 10, so she needs 10 more. The cost for each additional picture is $15.00, so 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add up the costs of the additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

Finally, we add the initial installation cost to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"Let's figure out how much money Roy has saved.

We know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Roy has saved than Anthony. It's given that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to figure out how high each person can lift it in relation to Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch.

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours, Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 4 hours is:
8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours, Mason's speed is still 8 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the next 6 hours is:
8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance:
32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we first need to figure out how long it takes for one kangaroo to make the trip. Since three kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we divide 18 hours by 3 to get the time it takes for one kangaroo. 

18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, it will take them twice as long to travel across the highway. 

Since there are four turtles, we multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4. 

6 hours * 2 = 12 hours per turtle
12 hours * 4 turtles = 48 hours

The final answer is: 48"

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to figure out the total amount of money she has after getting her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one. The original price is $600, and it's reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika got paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she got a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs, which is $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, to find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially, we subtract the money she received from the total amount of money she has: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.

Adam decides to slice 3 large apples and 5 small apples. To find the total number of slices, we need to multiply the number of large apples by the number of slices per large apple and the number of small apples by the number of slices per small apple.

For the large apples: 3 x 5 = 15 slices
For the small apples: 5 x 3 = 15 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left: 30 - 15 = 15

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to know how much milk each cow produces. Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, we can divide the total amount of milk needed (25 liters) by the amount each cow produces (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

First, let's find the unused portion of the first glue stick. Since it has 1/6 left, we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/6. 
1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters

Next, we find the unused portion of the second glue stick. It has 2/3 left, so we multiply 12 millimeters by 2/3. 
2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters

Now, we find the unused portion of the third glue stick. It has 1/2 left, so we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/2. 
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each. To find the total cost of the squirt guns, we multiply the number of squirt guns by the cost of each squirt gun: 6 x $2 = $12.

Next, he buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each. To find the total cost of the water balloons, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of each pack: 3 x $3 = $9.

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount he spent: $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 20 students in the class. Out of these, 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only. The rest are good at both subjects.

To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both subjects. 

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only, we can find the number of students good at both by subtracting the sum of these two groups from the total number of students.

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7

Now, we know that 7 students are good at both subjects. To find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both subjects.

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. However, there's a 10-minute intermission, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 10 minutes to get on stage, perform, and get off. To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform at the concert.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"To find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we need to figure out how many white shirts don't have collars and how many floral shirts don't have buttons.

First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, that's 40 / 2 = 20 shirts. So, 20 white shirts have collars. 

Now, let's find out how many white shirts don't have collars. We know there are 40 white shirts in total, and 20 of them have collars. So, 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Next, let's find out how many floral shirts have buttons. We know 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. That's 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray. 

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray

"Let's figure out how many goats are left in the two farms. 

First, we need to find out how many goats are left in Farm X. Mr. Smith started with 55 goats and sold 10, so we subtract 10 from 55. 
55 - 10 = 45

Now, let's find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. We know that twice as many goats were sold from Farm Y as from Farm X, and we know that 10 goats were sold from Farm X. So, we multiply 10 by 2 to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y.
10 * 2 = 20

Now that we know 20 goats were sold from Farm Y, we can find out how many are left. Mr. Smith started with 45 goats in Farm Y, so we subtract 20 from 45.
45 - 20 = 25

Now that we know how many goats are left in each farm, we can find the total number of goats left. We add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes per year by the number of pairs he buys per year.

First, let's figure out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount he spends on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys per year (24):

$2640 / 24 = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

First, let's find the cost of 3 baskets of green food: 3 * $25 = $75
Next, we'll find the cost of 3 baskets of red food: 3 * $18 = $54
Now, we add the cost of the green and red food together: $75 + $54 = $129
Since we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, we'll multiply the discount by the number of baskets: 3 * $2 = $6
Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to figure out how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms in total, half of that would be 45 rooms.

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

Since we want to know the time in hours, we need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, age cannot be a decimal, so we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

Since age cannot be a decimal, we can try to find a whole number solution by testing different values of x.

Let's try x = 8: 
My age is 8, my brother's age is 8 + 3 = 11, my sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(11) - 1 = 32.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 = 57, which is less than 87.

Let's try x = 9: 
My age is 9, my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 10: 
My age is 10, my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 11: 
My age is 11, my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 12: 
My age is 12, my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44.

The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 13: 
My age is 13, my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87, which is equal to 87.

Therefore, the correct answer is 13.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, we need to find the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student: 27 * 2 = 54.

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack, which is 8. So, we divide 54 by 8: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on each day and add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water, we add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 10 people infected. Each of these people infects 6 others every day. So, on the first day, 10 * 6 = 60 new people get infected. This brings the total number of infected people to 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

On the second day, the 60 people who got infected on the first day infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. The 10 people who were initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, the total number of infected people on the second day is 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

On the third day, the 360 people who got infected on the second day infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people. The 60 people who got infected on the first day infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. The 10 people who were initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, the total number of infected people on the third day is 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"Let's break down the information given:

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to figure out how many slices of banana bread she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is half a dollar. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice.

First, we need to convert the price per slice to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 50 cents is 50/100 = 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 slices * 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let F be the number of books Fawn has, A be the number of books Anne has, and S be the number of books Sofie has.

We can write two equations based on the given information:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = F + 13.

Now, we know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books). We can substitute the first equation into this equation to get (F + 13) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Subtract 13 from both sides: 2F + A = 72

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation: 2F + (F - 12) = 72

Combine like terms: 3F - 12 = 72

Add 12 to both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

Let's start with the soda. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, then we can divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of 1 bottle of soda. $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Now, let's find the cost of 1 bottle of water. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, then we can divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of 1 bottle of water. $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now that we know the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to know how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know he's selling 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he'll make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we're told he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he'll make $9000 from selling the chickens, we need to find the cost price of the chickens. To do this, we subtract the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to know how many glasses Micah sold. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a 20-meter rope. So, we multiply the length of the new rope by the price per meter:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope:

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To find out when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to first determine her current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18. 

Her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, let's say it takes 'x' years for her age to be thrice her present age. At that time, her age will be 8 + x. Since it will be thrice her current age, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Solving for x, we get x = 3 * 8 - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16.

So, it will take Melanie 16 years for her age to be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon. Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and Kelly has 6 packets of chicken. So, the cost of the chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.

Now, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, the cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Finally, we need to find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and Kelly has 7 packs of apples. So, the cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now that we have the cost of all the items, we can find the total cost by adding them together: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's say the runtime of her usual concert is x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long, its runtime is 2x minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We know that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

So, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then multiply the number made on Friday by 2.

First, let's add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday: 125 + 125 = 250
Then, we multiply the number made on Friday by 2: 2 * 125 = 250
Now, we add the results of both calculations: 250 + 250 = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we need to figure out how many microphones can be paired up. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can divide the total number of microphones by 2 to get the number of pairs.

However, we know that 20% of the microphones won't fit in the arrangement. This means 80% of the microphones will be paired up. We can find 80% of 50 by multiplying 50 by 0.8.

50 * 0.8 = 40

Now, we know that 40 microphones will be paired up. To find the number of pairs, we divide 40 by 2.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying, we can multiply 6 by 2/3 to get the number of birds flying. 

6 * (2/3) = 4

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we can multiply 3 by 8 to get the total number of birds feeding.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of jars.

First, let's find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now, we need to divide the cookies left by the number of jars to find out how many cookies were in each jar.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

First, let's find the total number of petals on the orchids. There are 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25.

Next, let's find the total number of petals on the daisies. There are 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to first find out how many of the plants are flowering plants.

We know that one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. To find this number, we multiply the total number of plants by 1/4: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find this number, we multiply the remaining plants by 2/3: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to figure out how fast the thingamabob spins. We know that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Let's use this information to find the speed of the thingamabob. If the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster than the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. She buys 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3. 

To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to know the total cost of her daily goods, which is $11. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Here, 'x' represents the cost of one carrot. We can combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2x + 9 = 11

Now, we can subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with 'x':

2x = 2

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to know his new hourly wage and the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's pay was raised by $2 per hour, so we add $2 to his old hourly wage of $10. His new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find the total number of hours he works in a week, we multiply the hours he works in a day by the number of days he works in a week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Similarly, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, we need to find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Now, we can find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find out how much profit John makes from renting his car, we need to know how much he earns and how much he pays for the car.

John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. He gets paid $25 an hour. So, let's calculate how much he earns in total.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Car payment: $500

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. To find out how many notebooks she had initially, we subtract the number of notebooks she bought from the total number of notebooks she has now. So, Martha had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks initially.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to first find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

To find 1/5 of 50 miles, we multiply 50 by 1/5. This is the same as dividing 50 by 5. 50 divided by 5 is 10. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first figure out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Susan started with 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Calvin's pot can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 other adults) and 2 children, a total of 6 people will be eating dinner.

Each person will eat one bowl, so 6 bowls will be used for dinner. Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, we can say that 8 child bowls is equal to 4 adult bowls. This means that 4 adult bowls were used for dinner, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls.

Now, we need to find out how many child bowls are left. Since 4 child bowls were used for dinner, we subtract that from the total number of child bowls the pot can fill: 8 - 4 = 4. So, there are 4 child bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, we need to divide the number of child bowls left by the number of children to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 4 / 2 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for the small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks to get the material per small mask. This gives us 0.5 yards per small mask. Now, we multiply this by the number of small masks she needs to make, which is 20. So, 0.5 yards per mask * 20 masks = 10 yards.

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for the large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks to get the material per large mask. This gives us 0.75 yards per large mask. Now, we multiply this by the number of large masks she needs to make, which is 8. So, 0.75 yards per mask * 8 masks = 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for small masks and large masks together. 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to figure out how many hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how many hours Harold spends on these activities, we add them up: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours he spends on these activities from the total hours in a day to find his free time: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Tim has 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. He uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of his red shoeboxes to go fishing.

To find out how many red shoeboxes he used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's find out how many shoeboxes are left. We subtract the number of shoeboxes used from the initial number of shoeboxes.

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

First, let's find out how many marbles he gave to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 30 divided by 5, which equals 6. 

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we need to subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had. 

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
We know Duncan's current age is 60, so we subtract 8 from that to find his age eight years ago: 60 - 8 = 52.
Now we can plug that into our equation: 52 = 2x
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 26
This means Adam's age four years ago was 26.

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.
To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

"Let's figure out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday. 

Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. He works at a rate of 50 packages per hour, but he completes 10 less than that, so he completes 40 packages per hour.

To find out how many packages he completes in 8 hours, we multiply 40 packages per hour by 8 hours. That's 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Now, we need to find out how much money he earns for 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply 320 packages by $0.20. That's 320 * $0.20 = $64.

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by 30 minutes (since he drinks a bottle every half hour).

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we need to divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks. 

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. There are 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We also know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Since some of the bologna was thrown at yellow balloons, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say the number of yellow balloons is y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is the sum of the bologna pieces thrown at red and yellow balloons, which is 40 + 3y. We know this equals 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to find the value of y: y = 6.

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to figure out how many miles he drives in 30 days. Since he drives 100 miles a day, we multiply 100 miles by 30 days.

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles. We can do this by dividing 3000 miles by 1000 miles.

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. 
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

Larry has 3 cats.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The number of fish in his tank is three times the number of rabbits, which is 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to know how many slices Abby and Josh can eat per day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. 

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to first figure out how many cups of tea are in each row. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and she divides them into 3 rows. 

So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5.

If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. 

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. Since it takes him 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick up in 2 trips to get a total of 24 berries. If he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find out how many berries he picks per trip. 

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

So, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, we need to first figure out how much water is in the tank initially. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons in the pool, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons of water will be used.

Now, to find out how much water is left in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses. He's already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each) and 8 movies on other days ($7 each). He's also bought 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each) and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each).

First, let's calculate the total money spent on movies: 5 * $10 = $50 (for Fridays and Saturdays) and 8 * $7 = $56 (for other days). That's a total of $50 + $56 = $106 spent on movies.

Next, let's calculate the total money spent on snacks: 2 * $8 = $16 (for popcorn) and 4 * $2 = $8 (for candy). That's a total of $16 + $8 = $24 spent on snacks.

Now, let's add up all the money spent: $106 (movies) + $24 (snacks) = $130.

Colby's monthly budget is $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to see a movie on a Friday, and tickets for Fridays cost $10, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday. That leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

In total, Colby can see 1 movie on a Friday and 1 movie on another day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled. 

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we need to know how many toys she had before buying them and how many she had after buying them. We know that after buying the bouncy balls, she had a total of 62 toys. 

Let's first find out how many toys she had before buying the bouncy balls. We know that the bag of building blocks has 31 blocks, the bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals, and the tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings. 

So, the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

Now, to find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we need to subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls. 

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We can start by writing an equation based on the information that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
P + Pp + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation:
Pp = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
P = Pp + J

Now, let's substitute Pp from the second equation into the first equation:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Next, let's substitute P from the third equation into the equation above:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 20 = 100

Now, let's solve for J:
3J = 100 - 20
3J = 80
Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80/3
J = 26.67

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 26.67 + 10
Pp = 36.67

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

The final answer is: 63.34"
"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To figure out how many tables they need, we first need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. 

They got 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already had 10 boxes, so now they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes in total.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey spits each seed 10 feet, and she has 40 seeds. So, her total distance is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits each seed 12 feet, and she has 35 seeds. So, her total distance is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we add their total distances together: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

Next, we need to find the total number of seeds spat. Zoey spat 40 seeds and Sydney spat 35 seeds, so the total is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average distance, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month.

So, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's find out how much money each machine will make in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the money made from the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to figure out how much each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, we can find out how much a sheep needs by doubling that amount and then subtracting 3 pounds.

Doubling the 5 pounds a goat needs gives us 10 pounds. Subtracting 3 pounds from that gives us 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. So each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, so they need 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay. There are 12 sheep, so they need 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, we need to first calculate how much money he has left after working for 6 hours at 50 dollars an hour.

John's earnings: 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. So, we subtract these amounts from his earnings.

Remaining money: 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money. Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John buys 5 of them.

Cost of pencils: 5 * 10 = 50 dollars
Remaining money after buying pencils: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Now, we can find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens: 100 / 25 = 4

"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to add up the cost of the visit, the cost of the parts, and the labor cost.

First, let's find the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply 2.25 by 35.

2.25 * 35 = 78.75

So the labor cost is $78.75. Now, we add the cost of the parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

78.75 + 60 = 138.75
138.75 + 40 = 178.75

"Let's break it down step by step. James bought 10 CDs for $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150. But he got them for 40% off, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. So, after the discount, he paid $150 - $60 = $90.

Now, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making it 5 * $40 = $200. Since he spent $90 and made $200, he made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

However, the question asks how much money he was out, which means he actually made a loss. So, he was out $110.

"To find out how long it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find out how long it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the commission from the New York Times. 
- The number of copies sold is 6.
- The price per copy is $5.
- The commission rate is 10%.
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Next, let's find the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
- The number of copies sold is 10.
- The price per copy is $15.
- The commission rate is 8%.
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commission from both newspapers to find the total commission.
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We can write two equations based on the given information:

B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

Since both equations are equal to B, we can set them equal to each other:

A + 20 = D + 10

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 10 from both sides:

A + 10 = D

Now we have another equation: B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team is 45).

We can substitute B = A + 20 into this equation:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Now we can substitute A + 10 = D into this equation:

2A + (A + 10) + 20 = 45

Combine like terms:

3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers to the inch, we have 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to know how many minutes he worked and how many reports he staples per minute. He staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.

First, let's figure out how many minutes he worked. He stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to figure out her total sleep time and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That's 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 minutes to get her total sleep time: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

We need to find out how long she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. To find the time she was sleepwalking, we subtract the start time from the end time: 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to know how many measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Now, we know that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. To find the number of spoons, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

Since Jonathan still has all his cups, we add the remaining spoons to the number of cups to find the total number of utensils he has.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital, we first need to find out how many beds are occupied. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200. This means 200 beds are occupied. 

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. 

4/5 of 1000 is 800. So, there are 800 unoccupied beds initially.

Now, let's calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to multiply 50 by 14 (number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break it down step by step. Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of those, 7 are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's (9 * 2) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many non-work emails are not to her family. That's 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of these emails are to her boyfriend. To find one-third of 3, we multiply 3 by 1 and then divide by 3. That's (3 * 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given:

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. 

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to figure out 20% of the number that Courtney reported and then subtract that from the number she said.

First, let's find 20% of 48. To do that, we multiply 48 by 0.20. 

48 * 0.20 = 9.6

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we need to find the total number of balls carried by all three boys. We can do this by adding up the number of balls each boy carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, we are told that the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, which means the total number of balls they carried is equal to the total number of balls the coach brought to practice.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to figure out the total number of holes they dug by the end of the fourth day and then subtract the number of holes they had at the end of the third day.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Now, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day to find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got the same amount of corn chips, which is 70. Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others. 

If we let x be the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got, then Collins got x + 15 corn chips. Since we know Amora and Lainey got 70, we can say that x = 70.

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips. To find the total, we add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

50% of the cost of supplies is 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokémon. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We can start by writing an equation based on the total number of Pokémon caught: A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write another equation: L = S + 5.

Additionally, we know that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's figure this out. We know each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. The problem also says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes in an episode. Since there are 20 minutes in an episode, there must be 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's find the distance the bird traveled in the first 10 hours. The bird was flying at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled is 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Then, the bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled is 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's find the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. Then, she got 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. Finally, her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Now, let's find out how many brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's find the time for the synthetic gut racquets. There are 3 racquets that need to be strung with synthetic gut, and it takes Andy 15 minutes to string each one. So, the total time for the synthetic gut racquets is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, we'll find the time for the polyester string racquets. There are 5 racquets that need to be strung with polyester string, and it takes Andy 22 minutes to string each one. So, the total time for the polyester string racquets is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Now, let's find the time for the hybrid racquets. There are 4 racquets that need to be strung with a hybrid set, and it takes Andy 18 minutes to string each one. So, the total time for the hybrid racquets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"So, John wants to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. The first 2 phones cost $600 each, and the rest are half price. 

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so that's 2 * $600 = $1200.

The other 2 phones are half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, 2 * $300 = $600 for the other 2 phones.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the other 2 phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we multiply 160 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, 160 / 4 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to know the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Now, let's find the number of states in India. It's given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29. 

So, India has 29 states. 

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn this amount. Since he earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and he has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we need to subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries together, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday. We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, he must have sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day. The gingerbread costs $6 per box, and the apple pie costs $15 per box.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie, so his total earnings for Saturday are (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie, so his total earnings for Sunday are (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

To find the total earnings for two days, we add the earnings from Saturday and Sunday: 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To figure out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate how much sunscreen she'll use in total. Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she'll reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

She'll be on vacation for 8 days, so she'll reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she'll use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she'll need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to figure out 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of $100. To do this, we multiply $100 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 0.4). 

0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - $40
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, and twice as old as his brother. 

First, let's figure out how old Emil's brother will be when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother, his brother will be half of Emil's age. So, when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

To find the current age of Emil's dad, we need to subtract 5 from 48, since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years. So, Emil's dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

To find the current age of Emil's brother, we need to subtract 5 from 12, since Emil's brother will be 12 when Emil turns 24. So, Emil's brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"

Her mother gave her 20 beads. 
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. 
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we first need to figure out how many football players there are. Since 20% of the class are football players and there are 30 students in the class, we can calculate 20% of 30.

20% of 30 is 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not football players. That would be 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we can calculate 25% of 24.

25% of 24 is 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

So, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. That would be 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 is the same as 18 divided by 2, which is 9.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the petunias. There are 5 baskets, and each basket needs 3 petunias. So, we multiply 5 by 3 to get the total number of petunias, which is 15. Each petunia costs $3.00, so we multiply 15 by $3.00 to get the total cost of the petunias, which is $45.00.

Next, let's find the cost of the sweet potato vines. There are 5 baskets, and each basket needs 2 vines. So, we multiply 5 by 2 to get the total number of vines, which is 10. Each vine costs $2.50, so we multiply 10 by $2.50 to get the total cost of the vines, which is $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the cost of the vines to get the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They're planning to plant sunflowers, carnations, and roses.

First, we need to figure out how much soil is needed for the sunflowers and carnations. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they're planting 4 sunflowers. So, the total soil needed for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the soil needed for the carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they're planting 10 carnations. So, the total soil needed for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil needed for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. This means they've used 27 pounds of soil so far.

Since they started with 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for the roses. Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to know how much she saves each month and how many months are in a year.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of that aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply 0.25 by $2,000.00. 

0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12 to find out how much she saves in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to figure out how long it takes her to do each task separately.

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide 90 by 6 to get the time. 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide 90 by 30 to get the time. 90 / 30 = 3, so it takes her 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done at the same time, we need to find the longer time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The longer time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to figure out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then subtract that from the age at which Bill saw the comet for the second time.

Let's start by finding out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet. We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means Bill was 3 times his dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let's call Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that 75 years passed between the time Bill's dad saw the comet and the time Bill saw it for the second time.

Since Bill was 3x years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and 75 years passed between the two events, we can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 75.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 37.5.

This means Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet. However, since age is a whole number, we can assume that Bill's dad was 38 years old when he saw the comet (as he can't be half a year old).

Now, we know that Bill's dad was 38 years old when he saw the comet, and Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet. This means that 30 - 38 = -8 years passed between the time Bill was born and the time his dad saw the comet.

However, this is not possible since Bill was alive when his dad saw the comet. So, we need to re-evaluate our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equation 3x - x = 75. We can simplify it to 2x = 75.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 37.5.

However, this is still not possible since age is a whole number. Let's try another approach.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that 75 years passed between the time Bill's dad saw the comet and the time Bill saw it for the second time.

Let's call Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time ""y"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3y.

We know that 75 years passed between the two events, so we can set up the equation: 3y - y = 75.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2y = 75.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 37.5.

However, this is still not possible since age is a whole number. Let's try another approach.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that 75 years passed between the time Bill's dad saw the comet and the time Bill saw it for the second time.

Let's call Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is x - 75.

We know that Bill was 3 times his dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time. This means x - 75 = 3(30).

Simplifying the equation, we get x - 75 = 90.

Adding 75 to both sides, we get x = 165.

Now, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from 165. This gives us 165 - 75 = 90.

However, this is not possible since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet. So, we need to re-evaluate our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equation x - 75 = 3(30).

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to figure out how many checks he writes for each type of bill and then add them all together.

First, let's think about the electric and gas bills. He writes a check for each of these every month, so that's 12 checks for each one. That's 12 + 12 = 24 checks.

Next, we need to think about the checks he writes to the church. He writes two checks to the church every month, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 checks.

Now, let's think about the checks he writes to the pest and lawn service. He writes a check to them every three months, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 24 (electric and gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by multiplying 44 by 2. This gives us 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply 88 by 3/4. This gives us 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights and divide the result by 2. So, we have (88 - 66) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total age of the four children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Half of 1500 is 750, so the church got 750 cookies.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got: 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total watermelon is 100 units. Since each kid gets a slice that is half the size of each adult's slice, we can represent the amount each kid gets as x and the amount each adult gets as 2x.

There are 4 kids, so the total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x. There are 2 adults, so the total amount given to the adults is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of watermelon is 100 units, so we can set up the equation: 4x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 8x = 100.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 100 / 8 = 12.5.

Now that we know each kid gets 12.5 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 12.5 = 25 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each inpatient takes 20 minutes. So, the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones works 9 hours, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

So, it takes 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to figure out the total number of boxes they sold and then divide 64 by that number. 

First, let's add the number of boxes they sold: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8. 

So, together they sold 8 boxes. Now, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars (64) by the total number of boxes (8) to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

"To find the total earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

We're given that Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, and Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

There are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled. 

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. So, his distance is 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and he traveled for 10 hours. So, his distance is 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. The difference is 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can find the number of male students over 16 by dividing 1500 by 4, which equals 375. This means there are 1125 female students over 16.

Next, we know that the other half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students. Half of these students are male, so we divide 1500 by 2 to get 750 male students under 16. This means there are 750 female students under 16.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which equals 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Next, Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Then, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which means she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Finally, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to figure out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in total. 

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she did the day before, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B, on the other hand, pumped 1/3 of what she did the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water they pumped is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After that, it started losing 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's start by finding the charge remaining after the first 5 hours. Since it's losing 9% each hour, we can multiply 9% by 5 to find the total percentage lost. 9% * 5 = 45%. So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after the next 3 hours. It's losing 7% each hour, so we multiply 7% by 3 to find the total percentage lost. 7% * 3 = 21%. So, the charge remaining after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last 3 hours. To find the charge lost in the last 3 hours, we subtract 28% from 34%. 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after 8 hours. We already know it's 34%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours. We can do this by subtracting 34% from 55%. 55% - 34% = 21%.

Now, let's find the initial charge. We know that the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 21%. So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 34%. Solving for x, we get x = 55%.

The final answer is: 55"
"To figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for a down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to know how much she makes in a week. She gets $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips, so that's a total of $25 an hour.

If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings would be $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much she needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. To find 20% of a number, we multiply it by 0.2. So, 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save up for the down payment.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Jamaar has left after buying the fruits he already purchased. 

The cost of 3 peaches at $0.5 each is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5. 
The cost of 4 pears at $0.5 each is 4 * $0.5 = $2. 
The cost of 2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 * $1 = $2. 
The cost of 5 apples at $0.75 each is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs. 
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

First, we need to find 5% of the original price of $120. To do this, we multiply $120 by 0.05. 

5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6

Now, we add the increase in price to the original price to get the price after one year.

Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Next, we need to find 5% of the new price, which is $126.

5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30

Now, we add the increase in price to the price after one year to get the price after two years.

Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Finally, we need to find 5% of the new price, which is $132.30.

5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615

Now, we add the increase in price to the price after two years to get the price after three years.

Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to figure out how many pictures were in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only, so we multiply the number of selfies albums by the number of pictures per album to find the total number of selfies.

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 27 portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's figure out how many guests are left in the hotel.

There were 100 guests initially. 24 of them checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100: 100 - 24 = 76.

Then, 15 guests decided to stay late, so we subtract 15 from 76: 76 - 15 = 61.

Now, twice as many people checked in as those who stayed late. Since 15 stayed late, we multiply 15 by 2 to find out how many checked in: 15 * 2 = 30.

We add the 30 new guests to the 61 guests who were already there: 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so we add 7 to 91: 91 + 7 = 98.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to understand the relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. If we let 'x' be the number of small stuffed animals and 'y' be the number of large stuffed animals, we can write an equation: x = 2y.

Next, we need to consider the prices of the stuffed animals. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, and each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, which is $12.

Now, let's think about the total earnings from the sales. We know that Teresa earned $120 from the sales. This is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120. Simplifying the equation, we get 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Now that we know y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

Now, we multiply 11 sandwiches by 7 days to get the total number of sandwiches they eat in one week: 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes. She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

First, we know that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.

There were 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.

Now, let's subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs the friends found.

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by the Smith twins = 60
Remaining unfound eggs = 10

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

If one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is 3/2 = $1.5. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is 6/4 = $1.5. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to first subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000. Tom sold his old bedroom for $1000, so we subtract that from the total cost:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

This means Tom still owes $2000 for the bedroom set. Now, we need to find out how much he has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, which is the same as 0.10. To find the monthly payment, we multiply the amount still owed by the interest rate:

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

"To find out how many balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

First, let's start with the initial number of balloons: 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow.

When a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, 10 red balloons popped. So, Sally was left with 15 red balloons.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.

As she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she has: 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue. 

The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To do this, we need to subtract 102% from 100%. However, we can't subtract a larger number from a smaller number. Instead, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2%. Then, we can subtract 2% from 100% to get 98%.

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can get, we need to subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can get.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Each graduate can get 5 tickets.

"To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to figure out how many small beans are equivalent to the number of medium-sized beans he can eat.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, we can find out how many small beans that is by multiplying 150 by 3.

150 * 3 = 450

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"So, Melissa is on jury duty and she spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. She gets paid $15 per day, but she has to pay $3 for parking each day. To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to do some math.

First, let's figure out how much she earns in total. She gets paid $15 per day for 3 days, so that's 3 x $15 = $45. But she also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's 3 x $3 = $9. To find out how much she has left after paying for parking, we subtract the parking cost from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked: $36 ÷ 18 = $2.

"So, let's break this down. Jim gets $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years, which is a total of $200,000. He also loses $25,000 per year for 4 years because he's not working, which is another $100,000. So, he needs to pay back $200,000 in loans and $100,000 in lost income, which is a total of $300,000.

After he graduates, his income triples, so he now makes $75,000 per year. To find out how long it'll take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5. 425 divided by 5 is 85. Then, we add 17 to that number, which is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2, which is 204. Then, we add 5 to that number, which is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

Next, let's find the cost of the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person. So, the cost of the pasta salad is 6 * $6 = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to find the total cost. $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's look at the losses and wins. In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

There are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities, and each city has 1000 people living in it. 

First, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 26 * 5 = 130
Then, we multiply the result by the population per city: 130 * 1000 = 130,000

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights. 

Xavier was initially 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Since he grew 3 inches over the summer, his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was initially 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, making his current height 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that three people divided an amount of $1920. Let's say the first person's share is x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

So, the first person's share is $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to figure out how many hours they worked in total and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, let's find out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, we need to find out how many hours they worked each day. They worked 3/8 of a day, and there are 24 hours in a day. To find out how many hours that is, we multiply 3/8 by 24. 

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (3) by the whole number (24) and keep the denominator (8) the same. This gives us 3 * 24 / 8 = 72 / 8 = 9 hours.

Now that we know they worked 9 hours a day, we multiply that by the number of days they worked, which is 21. 9 * 21 = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked. 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x. 

In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought for $20,000 in 2007. It depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, let's find the price in 2008. To do this, we multiply the initial price by the depreciation rate (21% or 0.21) and subtract the result from the initial price.

Price in 2008 = $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Now, let's find the price in 2009. We multiply the price in 2008 by the depreciation rate and subtract the result from the price in 2008.

Price in 2009 = $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Finally, let's find the price in 2010. We multiply the price in 2009 by the depreciation rate and subtract the result from the price in 2009.

Price in 2010 = $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find out how many books are written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.
10% of the books are written in German, which is 50 * 0.1 = 5 books in German.

Now, we add the number of English and German books together: 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so now there are 120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.

At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, but 100 people get on. To find the new total, we need to subtract 50 from 140 and then add 100. So, 140 - 50 = 90, and 90 + 100 = 190.

Now, at the third stop, 80 people get off the train. To find the final total, we subtract 80 from 190. 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's start with the tank top. It costs $10. 

Next, we need to find the cost of the running shorts. They cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, let's move on to the tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we need to divide the original price by 2. $48 / 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we need to subtract the coupon amount from the original price. $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to know how many tiles are needed. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, it covers 1 SqFt. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. To find the number of tiles needed, we divide the total area by the area of a single tile: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we need to find the total cost. Each tile costs $12. Multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"So James has to buy insurance, but because he had an accident, it's going to cost him more. The normal cost is $120 a month, but it's 60% more than that. 

To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of $120. To do that, we multiply $120 by 0.6. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to figure out how many loads he does in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

The amount each cat eats per day is 60 grams. Since Imma feeds her cats twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get 120 grams per day.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (120 grams): 720 / 120 = 6.

The cat food will last for 6 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32.

We're also given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Now, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. Since the total time is 98 minutes, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

This means Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to 40:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

First, let's start with the cast. The doctor charges $200 for it.

Next, we have the visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit is 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Now, let's talk about the painkillers. The doctor charges $4 per pill, and Hannah needs 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, we have the parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour, and Hannah has to park for at least 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"Let's break it down. James gets 80 emails a day. But 20% of those emails don't need a response. To find 20% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.2. 

80 * 0.2 = 16

So, 16 emails don't need a response. That means James responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5.

64 * 5 = 320

On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to figure out how many the glee club and the football team ate.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. That's 20 x 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost for the small coupons. There are 700 small coupons, and each one costs 5 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Next, we need to find the total cost for the big coupons. There are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so there are 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons together to find the total cost of postage. 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks that were dispatched to deliver fertiliser to farmers. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

Now, we're told that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser. To find out how many trucks had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of 20.

A quarter of a number is the same as 1/4 of that number. So, a quarter of 20 is 20 * (1/4) = 5. This means 5 trucks had mechanical failures.

Now, we need to find out how many trucks actually delivered the fertiliser. We know that 5 trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to figure out how much Dennis will pay for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, and the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can break it down into sets of 2 pounds. 

For every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays $4.00 for one pound and $2.00 for the other pound (since it's half off). 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, we have 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests invited. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so we need to subtract those from the total. 45 - 4 = 41 guests will be attending the party.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find out how many additional guests there are. 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so we multiply that by the number of additional guests: 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial fee of $125 to the cost of the additional guests: $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending some of their money, we can work backwards to find the total amount of money they had.

Let's say the total amount of money they had initially is x. Since they each had $60 after spending some of their money, we can set up the following equation:

(3/4)x + (2/3)x = 120

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. So we can rewrite the equation as:

(9/12)x + (8/12)x = 120

Combine the fractions:

(17/12)x = 120

Multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of the fraction:

17x = 1440

Now, divide both sides by 17:

x = 1440 / 17
x = 84.71

Since we can't have a fraction of a dollar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we're looking for the total amount of money they had, and we can use the exact value for our calculations.

Now that we know the total amount of money they had initially, we can find the amount of money they have left. Maggie has 3/4 of her money left, which is (3/4) * 84.71 = 63.53. Riza has 2/3 of her money left, which is (2/3) * 84.71 = 56.47.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have:

63.53 + 56.47 = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys, and they last for a week, which is 7 days.

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day. We know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Now, let's find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day: 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since there are 315 bananas in total and they last for 7 days, we can find the total number of bananas eaten in a day by dividing 315 by 7: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know that the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total eaten by the first two monkeys from the total eaten in a day: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

"Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five $5 bills, they only have quarters for change.

To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to figure out the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has saved so far. She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs: 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week: 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is 2000 * 0.75 = $1500.

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is 1500 * 1.2 = $1800.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid, which is 2000 - 1800 = $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie bowled a score of 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score. This is because Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. 

So, 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find out how long it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, he walked a total of 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we need to find out how long it took him to walk 8 miles. We know that James walks 4 miles per hour. To find the time, we can divide the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They decide to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know its growth rate per year. We know that it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

First, let's find out how much it grows per year. We can do this by dividing the total growth by the number of years.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now that we know the growth rate, we can find the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 150 Trekking bikes. We also know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, which is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

To find out how many MTB bikes Marcel sold, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the price of each type of bike. The price of an MTB is $500, so the price of a BMX bike is $500 / 2 = $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's figure out how many bales of hay are left in the field. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour, and they work for 6 hours. So, the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour, and it works for 6 hours as well. So, the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made. That's 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each period is 40 minutes long. He goes to class 5 days a week, so we multiply the minutes per period by the number of periods and the number of days.

6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

John also has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. We multiply the minutes per class by the number of classes and the number of days.

2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, we add the minutes for the regular classes and the extra classes.

1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. To find 1/16 of his weekly minutes, we first need to find the total minutes in a week.

There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours. Each hour has 60 minutes, so we multiply the number of days, hours, and minutes to find the total minutes in a week.

7 days * 24 hours per day = 168 hours per week
168 hours per week * 60 minutes per hour = 10080 minutes per week

Now, we find 1/16 of the total minutes per week.

1/16 * 10080 minutes per week = 630 minutes per week

Since John spends this extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we multiply the minutes by 2.

630 minutes per week * 2 = 1260 minutes per week

Now, we add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday.

1600 minutes per week + 1260 minutes per week = 2860 minutes per week

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours.

2860 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 47.67 hours per week

The final answer is: 47.67"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to start with the height of the first child. The first child is 6 feet tall, and since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the height to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

Now, we know the second child is two inches taller than the first child. So, we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.

72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. To find the height of the third child, we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.

74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

Finally, the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. To find the height of the fourth child, we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.

69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples they sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate half of what was left after the velociraptors, the velociraptors must have had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Now, the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. Since the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen starts with 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them. This means 3 sodas are shaken and 9 are not. She takes 1 of the unshaken sodas for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Then, Ellen's brother comes along and takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The question is, what's the chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

To find this out, we need to figure out the probability of her choosing a shaken can. There's 1 shaken can out of 7 total cans. 

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: 14.29"
"Let's break this down step by step. We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we need to find out how far each train has traveled. The first train is going 60 miles per hour, so after 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is going 30 miles per hour, so after 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Now, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them. 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to know how many days he works. We're looking at the time between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th, so that's a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Now, Billy takes 20% of those days off. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.2 by 50, which is 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

To find out how many days he actually works, we subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the number of people inside the church, we need to figure out how many people were transported by the buses and the cars. 

First, let's calculate the number of people transported by the buses. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, the total number of people transported by the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, let's calculate the number of people transported by the cars. There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, the total number of people transported by the cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars. 420 + 60 = 480.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, which is 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to figure out how old Martha is first. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. So, we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. We know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find out how many hours Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first figure out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's subtract the $15.00 return from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, which is $4.00. So, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Then, we calculate the cost of the towels. They were 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10, which is $3.00. So, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to get the total cost of the new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. This means that the large jellyfish make up 1/5 of the total number of jellyfish. 

We also know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue when exposed to UV light. This means that 1/3 of the large jellyfish are blue, and the rest are green.

When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Since these are the jellyfish that change from green to blue, they must be the 1/3 of the large jellyfish that change color.

Let's use 'x' to represent the total number of jellyfish in the tank. Since 1/5 of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

We know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish change color, so x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to know how much she needs to save for retirement and how much she can save each year.

Lauren's current salary is $100,000 per year. She plans to live on 40% of that in retirement, which is 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year. Since she wants to live for 20 years in retirement, she needs to save $40,000 x 20 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year, which is 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years it will take her to save $800,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year: $800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for retirement.

"To find the number of girls in the school, we need to first find the total number of students. Since 40% of the students are boys and there are 240 boys, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students.

Let's call the total number of students 'x'. We know that 40% of x is equal to 240. To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40/100 = 0.4.

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. The total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he had after saving: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"Let's figure out how much each book cost. Anna had a budget of $16 and she spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. 

After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

First, let's find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20. 

50 * 0.20 = 10

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60

So, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year."
"To find out how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to know how many times it blinks per minute. We know that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies initially. Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 1 female guppy. So, the new total for male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6, and for female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.

We also have 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes initially. Tate buys 2 more male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes. So, the new total for male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5, and for female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes. We have 6 male guppies and 5 male goldfishes, which makes a total of 6 + 5 = 11 male fishes. We have 8 female guppies and 8 female goldfishes, which makes a total of 8 + 8 = 16 female fishes.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each person and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

The total time they all took to do their chores is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many miles John drives in a month, we need to figure out how far he drives in one round trip and then multiply that by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

First, let's find the distance of a one-way trip. We know it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, we know John visits his parents twice a month. So, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to know how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days to get the total distance she will walk. 

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. To find half of 70 miles, we divide 70 by 2.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 1 hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Now, we know that the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. This means the fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour by dividing the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked. So, the fifth worker produces 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find one-fourth of 60, we divide 60 by 4. 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find half of 60, we divide 60 by 2. 60 / 2 = 30 pounds. So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers, and that's half of what Luis had. To find out how many stickers Luis had, we multiply 7 by 2. 

7 * 2 = 14

So, Luis had 14 stickers. Since Luis got half of Seth's stickers, we multiply 14 by 2 to find out how many stickers Seth had.

14 * 2 = 28

Therefore, Seth had 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to know how many M&M's he has in total. Since he bought 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Now, we know that each ounce contains 30 M&M's. So, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce.

30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can find the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to start with the average car's speed, which is 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to get the 2nd fastest car's speed.

120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know the 2nd fastest car goes 600 miles per hour. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so we multiply 600 by 1.25 to get the fastest car's speed.

600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's figure out how old Vince is now. We know that Liam is 16 years old right now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can find Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age two years ago by 2. So, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. So, Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call that number A. 

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, the number of eggs Camden painted is S + 12.

We can write an equation for the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah: S + (S + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms to get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides to get 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2 to get S = 9.

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many eggs Camden painted: S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms to get 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2 to get A = 13.

Now that we know Arnold painted 13 eggs, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to start by figuring out how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can make from 64 feet. We do this by dividing 64 by 4.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's figure out how much money Valerie, her brother, and her mom have together.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns half of what she earns, so he earns $5000 / 2 = $2500 per month.

Now, let's add Valerie and her brother's salaries together: $5000 + $2500 = $7500.

Their mom earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $7500 = $15,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $2500 + $15,000 = $20,000 + $20,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find out how long it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to figure out how fast she walks on the beach and the sidewalk.

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

We can use the formula distance/speed = time to find her speed on the beach. So, 2/x = 40. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by x, which gives us 2 = 40x. Then, we divide both sides by 40, which gives us x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk. Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

To find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, we use the formula time = distance/speed. So, time = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach (40 minutes) and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk (10 minutes) to find the total time. 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. She has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is $4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

First, let's find the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that had 7 blue birds each. Since there are 3 trees, we multiply 3 by 7, which equals 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees that had 4 blue birds each. To find the total number of blue birds in these trees, we multiply 2 by 4, which equals 8 blue birds.

Lastly, there's 1 tree that had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many marbles Bob has before he receives 2 dozen more marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can set up an equation: x + 24 = 84, where x is the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides: x = 84 - 24. 

x = 60

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

So, Bob will have 50 marbles if he loses 10 of the marbles he has.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Donny has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees. He pours 4 ounces from this mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. After this, he can drink the water, which means the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

We know that the average temperature of the two mugs is the total temperature of the two mugs divided by 2. Since Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

Let's call the temperature of the second mug x. The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2 to get rid of the fraction: (33 + x) * 5 >= 80.

Next, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 165 + 5x >= 80.

Now, we can subtract 165 from both sides of the inequality to isolate the term with x: 5x >= -85.

Finally, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 to solve for x: x >= -17.

However, since temperature cannot be negative, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find out how much each single bagel costs, we need to know the total cost of the bagels and the total number of bagels. 

First, let's find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00, so we multiply that by 4.
4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00

Now, we need to find out how much of a discount Russell gets. He gets a 10% discount, which is 10% of $40.00. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.1.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted cost.
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Next, we need to find out how many bagels are in 4 packs. Each pack has 9 bagels, so we multiply 9 by 4.
9 bagels * 4 packs = 36 bagels

Now, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel.
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate first. It's given that he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we need to divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops. 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 18 scoops. To find out how many potatoes he ate, we multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop. 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in that time period.

First, let's find out how many eggs he eats in the first 30 days. Since he eats 3 eggs a day, we multiply 3 by 30.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we find out how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days. Since he eats 5 eggs a day, we multiply 5 by 30.

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs from the first 30 days and the next 30 days to get the total number of eggs.

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 = 20

"To find out how many women are left on the bus, we need to first figure out how many women were on the bus initially. We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. To find the fraction of women, we take 9 out of 14. 

Now, we multiply this fraction by the total number of passengers on the bus, which is 84: (9/14) * 84 = 54. 

This means there were 54 women on the bus initially. Now, we need to subtract the number of women who got off at the next stop, which is 20. 

So, 54 - 20 = 34. 

Therefore, there are 34 women left on the bus.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to figure out how many bouquets and sunflowers he sold per day.

First, let's find out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to figure out how much he spends on rocks, how much he makes from selling them, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to spend on rocks that cost $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, Adam only sells 12 rocks, so he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Since Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find out how much money he loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"

First, we need to find out how many roses she has after giving some to her mother. She started with 30 roses and gave away 24. To find the remaining roses, we subtract 24 from 30.

30 - 24 = 6

So, Patricia has 6 roses left. Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add 6 and 15.

6 + 15 = 21

Therefore, Patricia has 21 roses now."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. 

First, let's add up the total distance: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. 

Next, we need to add up the total time: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be written as a decimal, which is 0.2. 

The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win, so we multiply 0.2 by 3 to get its probability, which is 0.6.

Now, we need to find the probability that both tickets win. To do this, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we let C be the number of seashells Carlos collected, we can write the equation C + 5 = 27. Solving for C, we get C = 22.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let R be the number of seashells Carrey collected, then Carlos collected 2R seashells. Since we know Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can write the equation 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide them equally, we need to find the total number of seashells first. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (since 60% is the same as 0.6 as a decimal).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

First, let's find the profit from Monday. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

Next, let's find the profit from Tuesday. Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to figure out how tall Carl is first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now that we know Carl's height, we can find the length of his cane. We're told that his cane is half as long as he is tall.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to know how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies. The remaining 1/4 are dressed in blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies.

Now, we're told that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. So, the number of blue-wearers wearing bows is 2. For the purple-wearers, 1/3 of 6 is 2, so 2 purple-wearers also wear bows.

In total, there are 2 blue-wearers and 2 purple-wearers wearing bows, making 4 babies in total wearing bows.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to divide the number of purple-wearers wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the answer is 50%."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to figure out how many reports they got on that day. 

We know they got a total of 5168 reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. 

Let's add the reports from Monday and Tuesday: 1907 + 1907 = 3814. Now, let's add the reports from Thursday and Friday: 2136 + 2136 = 4272. 

Now, we need to find out how many reports they got on Wednesday. We can do this by subtracting the total number of reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports last week. 

5168 (total reports) - 3814 (reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) = 1354. However, we only subtracted reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, not just Wednesday. We need to add back the reports from Thursday and Friday since we counted them twice. 

5168 (total reports) - 3814 (reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) + 2136 (reports from Thursday and Friday) = 2490. However, we added back the reports from Thursday and Friday, but we should only add back the reports from Thursday, not Friday. 

5168 (total reports) - 3814 (reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) + 2136 (reports from Thursday) = 2490. However, we added back the reports from Thursday, but we should only add back the reports from Thursday and Friday, not Monday and Tuesday. 

5168 (total reports) - 3814 (reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) + 2136 (reports from Thursday and Friday) - 1907 (reports from Monday and Tuesday) = 483."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50. To find half of 80, we divide 80 by 2, which equals 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. To find 1/4 of 80, we divide 80 by 4, which equals 20 square meters.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. We subtract the land he sold from the total: 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount of money he earned from this sale, we multiply 20 by 3, which equals $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from all the sales. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of that would be 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we know Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. So, we need to subtract 10 from 13.

13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days, we need to know how many face masks he uses in a day. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, we multiply the number of times he changes his mask by the number of times he goes out in a day.

2 (face masks per outing) * 3 (outings per day) = 6 face masks per day

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to figure out how many eggs each person found.

Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to know how many apartments he collects from and how much he gets paid per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it's 60% bigger than 400. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the number of apartments in all three complexes: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1440 * 3 = 4320 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

Now, let's consider the production of an 8-year-old tree. It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"

1/5 of $100 is $100 divided by 5, which is $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. If we let the length of the blue rope be B, then the length of the red rope is 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So, the length of the yellow rope is B + 7.

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. We can write an equation to represent this: R + B + Y = 37.

We can substitute R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37. This gives us 4B + B + B + 7 = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6B + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides to get 6B = 30.

Divide both sides by 6 to get B = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B. This gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem. We know there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half is a combination of red, white, and purple paint.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors ""x"". The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints, which is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. This means 3x = 6.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. The length is 20 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"

On Tuesday, she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. The regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box costs the same price but has 20% more pods.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as an equation: W = 5(C + 7), where W is Wendy's current age and C is Colin's current age.

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as another equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now, let's substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To simplify the equation, we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Next, we'll subtract 3C from both sides to get:
75 = 2C + 35

Then, we'll subtract 35 from both sides to get:
40 = 2C

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for C:
20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate how many slices of each type of pizza her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam also ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs per 60 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide 20 by 60, which gives us 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which they melt is 2 snowballs per 15 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate. To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15 (by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 5). Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 3/15 snowballs per minute. To do this, we can divide the number of snowballs (60) by the rate (3/15). To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: 60 / (3/15) = 60 * (15/3) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's age, we need to figure out how old he was 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age to find his age 20 years ago: 28 - 20 = 8.

Now, we know that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. So, we divide John's age 20 years ago by 2 to find Jim's age 20 years ago: 8 / 2 = 4.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to figure out how many slices each person ate. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses used 38 bandages on the first day and ordered 1 pack of 50. This means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left after the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. This means they had 12 + 50 - 28 = 34 bandages left after the second day.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. This means they had 34 + 100 - 25 = 109 bandages after ordering the new packs.

However, we know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have had 109 - 78 = 31 bandages used on the third day.

Now, let's go back to the first day. We know they used 38 bandages and had some left over. If they had 31 bandages used on the third day, and 12 left over after the first day, then they must have had 38 + 12 = 50 bandages at the start of the second day.

But we know they used 28 bandages on the second day, so they must have had 50 + 28 = 78 bandages at the start of the third day. This is a problem, because we know they had 109 bandages after ordering the new packs on the third day.

Let's go back to the start of the second day. If they had 78 bandages at the start of the third day, and used 25 bandages on the third day, then they must have had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages at the start of the third day. This means they must have had 103 - 28 = 75 bandages at the start of the second day.

Now, let's go back to the start of the first day. If they had 75 bandages at the start of the second day, and used 28 bandages on the second day, then they must have had 75 + 28 = 103 bandages at the start of the second day. This means they must have had 103 - 38 = 65 bandages at the start of the first day.

However, we know they ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages on the first day. This means they must have had 65 + 50 = 115 bandages at the start of the first day.

"So May is getting her hair cut and colored. The color costs $40, and the haircut costs $30 per inch. Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. To find the total cost, we need to figure out how much the haircut costs first.

We know the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. Since the haircut costs $30 per inch, we multiply 2 inches by $30 to get the cost of the haircut. That's 2 * $30 = $60.

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. So the total cost is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's figure out her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them up.

First, let's look at the tasks and their respective earnings:
- Laundry: Jason gets $3.00 for doing his laundry, and he did it once, so that's $3.00.
- Cleaning the room: He gets $1.50 for cleaning his room, and he did it once, so that's $1.50.
- Taking the trash out: Jason gets $0.75 for taking the trash out, and he did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
- Emptying the dishwasher: He gets $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher, and he did it 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the earnings:
$3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we need to know how much blood is in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to add up the number of people who entered at each time.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Finally, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time:
50 + 40 = 90
90 + 80 = 170
170 + 150 = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

We also know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, we're told he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. So, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we add 50% of $60 to $60. 50% of $60 is $60 * 0.5 = $30. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, we multiply the cost per bottle of cognac by the number of bottles to find the total cost of the cognac: 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total cost: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is 40 * 0.25 = 10. So, he planted 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer. His children drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24 to get 20 gallons. Then, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving us with 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. After that, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we divide 8 by 3.

8 / 3 = 2.67

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The problem says that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40, where x is the number of coffee mugs.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Now, we need to get rid of the 4 that's being multiplied by x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to divide the total number of fish by 3.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 66 / 3 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that don't have red stripes. We subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"Let's break it down step by step. Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we're told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to figure out how many shells team Alphas and team The finders found first.

Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4.

0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found their share. 

700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6.

0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found. We do this by subtracting the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total miles the first three dogs need to walk is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles all 4 dogs need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, to find the miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"So John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that. To find 40% of $250,000, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to figure out how many red jelly beans are actually in the jar. 

First, let's find the volume of the jar. The jar is a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed tightly, we need to account for the packing efficiency. The jelly beans get about 80% efficiency, so we'll multiply the volume by 0.8.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the bus had 20 people on it. Then, 40 people got on at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

Next, at the second stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop (40) got on the bus. To find 3/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 3 and then divide by 4. So, 40 * 3 = 120, and 120 / 4 = 30. This means 30 people got on the bus at the second stop. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. To double 90, we multiply it by 2, which gives us 180. So, the total number of people on the bus is now 180.

Since the bus can hold 200 people, we need to find out how many more people can fit on the bus. To do this, we subtract the number of people already on the bus (180) from the total capacity (200). This gives us 200 - 180 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ian has a board that's 40 feet long, and he wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must be equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to calculate the total width of the windows first. Since there are 5 windows and each one is 35 inches wide, we multiply the number of windows by the width of one window.

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Now, we need to find out how much fabric Luke should buy. He needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4. This is because you pay $0.25 for each minute of your call, and you're making a call for 16 minutes.

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4. This is because after 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute.

The total cost is $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Monday and then find twice that amount, and add 1 inch to it.

The amount of rain on Monday is 2 inches. Twice that amount is 2 x 2 = 4 inches. Adding 1 inch to that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, first, let's calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

A manicure costs $35, and a 20% discount is 0.2 * 35 = $7. So, the manicure costs $35 - $7 = $28 after the discount.

A pedicure costs $40, and a 20% discount is 0.2 * 40 = $8. So, the pedicure costs $40 - $8 = $32 after the discount.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Now, let's add the cost of nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's figure this out step by step. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. So, 39 - 8 = 31.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we need to find the price increase in December. The price increase is 80% of the initial price of $40. To find 80% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.8. 

0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price decrease in January. The price decrease is 50% of the price in December, which is $72. To find 50% of $72, we multiply $72 by 0.5.

0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find out how much money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

Now, let's find the total amount from the reduced rate lessons. Charlie has 2 lessons at 75% of his standard rate. To find 75% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.75. 
Reduced rate = $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour
Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the total amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day. 
Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to figure out what 1/4 of 20 is.

To do this, we multiply 20 by 1/4. Multiplying a number by a fraction is the same as multiplying the number by the numerator (1) and then dividing by the denominator (4). So, 20 * 1 = 20, and then we divide 20 by 4, which equals 5.

This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos. Since Eve originally had 20 pomelos and is left with 5, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the remaining amount. So, 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples he bought. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide by 5.

2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 25/100, which is 0.25).

0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find out how many novels Regina wrote this year, we need to figure out what one quarter of the total is. Since 9 novels is 3 quarters, we can find one quarter by dividing 9 by 3.

9 / 3 = 3

Now, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

3 * 4 = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find out how much of the distance Michael covered, we need to know how far he traveled in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, he traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, let's multiply his speed by the number of hours he traveled to find the distance covered. 

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we'll divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to figure out how many grapes were used in total and then add the grapes that were left over.

First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. He used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes. So, he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

Next, we add the grapes that Madeline and her brother used: 6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (her brother's grapes) = 36 grapes.

Now, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

However, we also know that the total number of grapes used by the mother is equal to the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their grapes. This means that the 48 grapes used by the mother are actually the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by their mother) = 84 grapes.

Since we know that the total number of grapes used is 84, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes that were left over. But, we know that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, so there are no grapes left over. This means that the initial number of grapes is equal to the total number of grapes used.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 of them were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

Now, we know that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers: 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find out what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to know how many hours they work in total and how many hours it takes to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to clean the school, and they work 8 hours a day. So, the total number of hours they have to clean is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Now, let's find out how many hours it takes to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. To find the total time in hours, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom and then divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to know how many books each shelf can hold. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Rose will make in profit, we need to first figure out how much she paid for the eggs and how much she'll get from selling them.

Rose bought 5 dozen eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. So, the total cost is:

5 * $2.40 = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find out how much she'll get from selling the eggs. She sells 3 eggs for $1, so we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has. 

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to first find the number of red and blue hats.

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much each stick of jerky costs, we need to first figure out the price of the bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. 

So, we subtract the discount from the original price: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00. 

Now, we need to convert this price to cents because we want to know the cost per stick in cents. To do this, we multiply the price by 100: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Next, we need to find the cost of each stick of jerky. There are 30 sticks in a bag, so we divide the total cost by the number of sticks: 1500 / 30 = 50 cents.

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to determine the total number of questions she needs to get right overall. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is S. Then the number of blueberry cubes is 5S - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116. This can be written as S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Now, let's simplify the equation. We can combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Next, we add 4 to both sides of the equation: 6S = 120.

Now, we divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5S - 4, which is 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

First, Jason needs to sell 15 cars to get his bonus. For every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 phone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership. To get 30 customers, he needs 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people in Brianna's family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to figure out how much each additional phone costs and then add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's say the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the main phone costs 2x.

We know the main phone costs $20, so we can set up an equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

First, let's find the cost for the blouses. There are 5 blouses and they cost $5.00 each. So, the cost for the blouses per week is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Next, we'll find the cost for the skirts. There's 1 skirt and it costs $6.00. So, the cost for the skirt per week is 1 * $6.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's find the cost for the pants. There are 2 pairs of pants and they cost $8.00 each. So, the cost for the pants per week is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

To find the total cost per week, we add the cost of the blouses, skirts, and pants. So, $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00.

Finally, we multiply the total cost per week by the number of weeks, which is 5. So, $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to know his new speaking speed and the total number of words he needs to speak.

First, let's find John's new speaking speed. Since he's 2.5 times faster than his original speed of 150 words per minute, we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 10 by 450.

Total words = 10 * 450 = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by John's new speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach. 

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people Conor saw on the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the kernels start popping at different rates in each 30-second interval.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped three times as fast as the initial rate, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped four times as fast as the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the kernels popped at half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make. He's making 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for his friend Allen. 

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons.

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Total lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Total lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 5 cups - 2 cups = 3 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 3/6 * 6 = 3 lemons

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 3 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 5 lemons

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house needs in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of food the dogs eat each day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find out how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day. There are 3 German Shepherds and each one eats 5 kilograms of food per day. So, 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms of food per day for the German Shepherds.

Next, we need to find out how much food the Bulldogs eat in a day. There are 2 Bulldogs and each one eats 3 kilograms of food per day. So, 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms of food per day for the Bulldogs.

Now, we add the food eaten by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs to get the total amount of food eaten per day. 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of food per day.

Finally, we multiply the total daily food consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption. 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms of food per week.

"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Total number of legs = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Total pairs of legs = 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to know the total number of blue and yellow blocks. There are 4 blue blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

Now, we need to find the number of red blocks. Since there are 32 blocks in total, we can subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 
32 - 12 = 20

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the difference.

First, let's find the distance Elvis traveled west. Since he drove at an average speed of 18mph for 5 hours, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, we find the distance Elvis traveled east. He drove at the same speed of 18mph for 8 hours, so we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house. The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3. This gives us $2700. So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated by another 30%. To find 30% of $6300, we multiply $6300 by 0.3. This gives us $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated by 20%. To find 20% of $4410, we multiply $4410 by 0.2. This gives us $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first figure out how many orange and yellow candies there are.

We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we multiply 54 by 2 to get the number of orange candies: 54 * 2 = 108.

Now, we need to find the number of yellow candies. We know it's half as many as the red candies, so we divide 54 by 2: 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know the number of red, orange, and yellow candies, we can add them up: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since there are 232 candies in total, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights. The cost of one night at the hotel is $80, and Helen stayed for 3 nights. So, the total cost of the hotel is $80 * 3 = $240.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1, which is $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus trips to find the overall cost of Helen's trip. $240 + $56 = $296.

"Let's break it down step by step. We know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. To find out how many marbles he initially had, we need to add the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now.

Dallas initially had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together. 

First, let's add the weight of the car and the luggage: 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds. 

Next, we need to add the weight of the two children. Since each child weighs 75 pounds, we multiply 75 by 2 to get the total weight of the children: 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

Now, we add the weight of the children to the weight of the car and luggage: 1450 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600, we multiply 1600 by 0.01: 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the length of the backyard fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to know their ages. Since Mia is 40 years old and she's younger than Emma, Emma must be 16 years older than Mia. So, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, to find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. Dividing 96 by 2 gives us 48.

"To figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to know how many hot dogs he needs in total. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs per guest:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total:

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs

In a week, Josh is open 5 days, and he services 3 cars each day. So, in a week, he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

Since there are 2 weeks, Josh will be open 10 days (5 days a week * 2 weeks). In those 10 days, he'll service 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he'll make 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

Randy eats 3 cookies for a snack, one of each flavor. So, he eats 3 cookies in total.

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. That's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now. We need to subtract the cookies he ate or gave away and add the cookies he baked.

Cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7
Cookies baked = 12

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to figure out how much he would get for the first half of his collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate was on vacation for 14 days. 

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

Now, we need to consider that the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Since Nate was on vacation for 14 days, the dog dug 6 new holes each night for 14 nights. 

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Next, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

First, let's add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies together: 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of cookies made: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Igor was supposed to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, he gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 

He also gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. Since he gathered 8 test tubes, we can set up an equation: 8 = 14 + 2. However, this equation doesn't make sense because it says Igor gathered 8 test tubes, which is less than the number of Petri dishes. Let's try again. If Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, then the number of test tubes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16. But we already know he gathered 8 test tubes, so this is incorrect. However, if we say he gathered 2 fewer test tubes than Petri dishes, then the number of test tubes he gathered is 14 - 2 = 12. 

Now, let's try to find the correct number of Petri dishes. If Igor gathered 2 fewer test tubes than Petri dishes, then the number of test tubes he gathered is 12. We know he gathered 7 beakers, so the total number of items he gathered is 12 + 7 + x, where x is the number of Petri dishes. We know the total number of items is 29, so we can set up the equation: 12 + 7 + x = 29. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 19 + x = 29. Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get x = 10. So, Igor gathered 10 Petri dishes.

Now that we know the correct number of test tubes, Petri dishes, and beakers, we can find the number of beakers Igor lost. The total number of items Igor gathered is 12 test tubes + 7 beakers + 10 Petri dishes = 29 items. However, we know the total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so he must have lost 29 - 29 = 0 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find the number of eggs in the second basket and add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain amount of time, Vanessa will run the same distance in twice as long.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. If Aaron runs 2 miles, Vanessa runs 4 miles.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can say that if Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa runs 2 miles in 32 minutes (twice as long).

But we know Vanessa runs 4 miles, which is twice as far as Aaron's 2 miles. So, if Vanessa runs 2 miles in 32 minutes, she runs 4 miles in 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to figure out how much line is needed for 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

This means he needs a total of 600 feet of line. However, he already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount needed:

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's find the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the daily revenue is:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Now, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open, which is 2 days a week.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first figure out the total amount of money the vendor made from selling all 50 watermelons. 

Since the vendor made a 25% profit, that means he sold the watermelons for 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora. We also know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we need to find out how old John is. We know that John had James when he was 19, and James is 18 now. This means that 18 years have passed since John had James. However, we also know that John had his youngest son when he was 32. To find out how old John is now, we need to know how old his youngest son is.

Let's call the age of John's youngest son ""x"". Since John was 32 when his youngest son was born, John's current age is 32 + x.

We are asked to find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years. In 3 years, his age will be x + 3.

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can use the information that James is 18 now and John had James when he was 19. This means that the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this means that John must have had James after he was 19. This is a contradiction, so the information given is inconsistent.

However, if we ignore the inconsistency and continue with the problem, we can find the current age of John's youngest son. We know that John's current age is 32 + x, and we also know that John had James when he was 19. This means that the time that has passed since then is 32 + x - 19 = 13 + x. Since James is 18 now, 18 = 13 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange and Jane takes 4 minutes to do the same. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, let's figure out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by the time it takes Ana to peel an orange, which is 3 minutes. So, 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Now, let's do the same for Jane. We divide 60 by the time it takes Jane to peel an orange, which is 4 minutes. So, 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now that we know how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour, we can find the difference. Ana can peel 20 oranges, and Jane can peel 15 oranges. The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Mark's car broke down and he needs a new radiator. He goes to a junk shop and gets it for 80% off the original price of $400. 

First, let's find out how much he paid for the radiator. To do that, we need to calculate 80% of $400. To find 80% of a number, we multiply it by 0.8. So, 400 * 0.8 = 320. This means the discount is $320. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price Mark paid for the radiator. 400 - 320 = 80. So, Mark paid $80 for the radiator.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the labor cost, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly wage. 3 * 50 = 150. So, the labor cost is $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid. 80 + 150 = 230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of animals on the farm is 20, and they are either chickens or cows. Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is W. So, we have the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

Now, let's solve for W in the first equation: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
