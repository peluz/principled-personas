"To determine Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after using some for breakfast and baking.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for baking, totaling 7 eggs used.

The number of eggs left is found by subtracting the used eggs from the total: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these remaining eggs at $2 each. To find her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the selling price: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the new value of the house: 
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a single sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance he covers in a session is the product of the number of sprints and the distance per sprint: 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Now, we need to find the total distance James runs in a week. Since he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the distance covered in a session by the number of sessions: 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The first term (a) is $5, the common ratio (r) is 0.6, and the number of terms (n) is 16.

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values, we get: S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city and then add them together.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The time to install the updates is given as 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then determine the remaining distance.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in the 4 hours:
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles
Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, we need to consider the time John spent in standstill traffic. Since he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, he didn't actually travel 4 hours. He traveled 3 hours initially and then 2.5 hours in the return trip (2 hours at 0 mph and 0.5 hours at 30 mph).

To find the remaining distance, we need to calculate the distance he would have traveled in the remaining 0.5 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 0.5
Distance = 40 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in the 4 hours:
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles
Distance traveled in the remaining 0.5 hours = 40 miles
Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 + 40 = 395 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles. However, if we are looking for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 0"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider her regular pay and overtime pay separately.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours. Her regular hourly rate is $10, so her earnings for the first 40 hours are 40 * $10 = $400.

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked a total of 45 hours and 40 hours are considered regular hours, the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, we can find her total earnings for the week by adding her regular pay and overtime pay: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since there are 3 dozen donuts and each dozen costs $68, the total cost of the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. There are 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80, so the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. There are 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55, so the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The total cost of the tree is $90 (initial cost).

The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.

So, the net revenue each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself, we need to divide the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this is the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself, but we want to know when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we need to consider the first year as the year it starts earning money.

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as ""x"".

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. After this sale, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us the solution: x = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the optimal purchase, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

For the jewelry, a 2.5% increase in value would be 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets, a 1.2% increase in value would be 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Comparing the two increases, the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, making it the optimal choice for maximizing profit.

The profit would be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this case, the two sides are the distances traveled by the train on the first day (80 miles) and the second day (150 miles). We can use these values to find the total distance covered by each train.

Let's apply the Pythagorean theorem:

Total distance^2 = 80^2 + 150^2
Total distance^2 = 6400 + 22500
Total distance^2 = 28900
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her total earnings from teaching and coaching, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Her hourly wage is $20, and she works 35 hours per week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked per year is 35 * 50 = 1750. Therefore, her annual earnings from teaching are 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from coaching. Her hourly wage is $30, and she works 15 hours per week. With 50 weeks of work per year, her total hours worked per year is 15 * 50 = 750. Consequently, her annual earnings from coaching are 750 * $30 = $22,500.

To find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of days in that time period. Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 28 days. She eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, 84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has available to complete the hike. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

However, Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to walk the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the original mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.
The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then calculate the time elapsed since his son was born.

Since Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can find Raymond's age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years have passed since then, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, excluding the pizza boxes. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes. 

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes.

Number of pizza boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Now, let's determine the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 x $42 = $126.

Finally, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The total amount Mishka spent on clothing items is $243."
"To determine the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Let's break down the information given: Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We know that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be represented by the equation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant representing the ratio between their ages.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, we calculate the total time spent per day by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog.

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

"To find the number of gold coins, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We are given two pieces of information: G = S + 30 and S + G = 110.

We can substitute G = S + 30 into the second equation, which gives us S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, the number of gold coins is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"

"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then determine how many sets he sold with his own money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

This means John spent $190 of the money he made from selling the Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he sold with his own money, we need to find out how much money he spent from his own pocket. Since he has $5 left, he must have spent $5 of his own money.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35 (190 - 5 = 185 dollars). 
185 / 15 = 12.33 (round down to 12 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 12 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales and 1 set with his own money.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 12 = 1 Lego set left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Let's break down John's running schedule: he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours, so he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking speed. Given that her skipping speed is half of her running speed and she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes and sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's find the total cost. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound * 2, which equals $20.00.

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to determine the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

First, let's find the number of blue ties. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. So, the number of blue ties is 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we first calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens, as eggs are sold by the dozen.

First, we find the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find Lloyd's weekly earnings:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removed and then determine how many toys he needs to remove to reach the desired weight reduction of 15 pounds.

First, let's find the total weight of the comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the toys Uriah needs to remove. Since he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the revenue from car tires only since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds

Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we calculate the 25% fee on the final bill. This is done by multiplying the final bill by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25 as a decimal). 

0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Next, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Then, we add the delivery fee:
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the tip:
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

First, we find the total number of raspberries in the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster: 
6 clusters * 20 raspberries per cluster = 120 raspberries

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries to the total number of raspberries in the clusters: 
120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of unripe oranges. 20% of the oranges are unripe, and there are a total of 25 oranges. 

20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Next, we know that there is 1 bad orange. To find the total number of oranges that are not good, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"

The cost of the material is $500. The cost of the jeweler is $800. 

First, we add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we calculate 10% of $1300, which is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years. For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The value of the pension after 10 years is 10 years * $50,000/year = $500,000.

For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000/year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year (for the first 10 years) + $25,000/year (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000/year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to consider the charges for the first and second halves of the year separately.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months and the second half also consists of 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. 
90% of $140 is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. This can be done by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Let's break it down:

Time spent watching TV in one day: 2 hours
Time spent reading in one day: 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour (since he reads for half as long as he watches TV)

Total time spent on TV and reading in one day: 2 + 1 = 3 hours

Since he does this 3 times a week, we need to multiply the daily time by 3: 3 hours * 3 = 9 hours

Now, we multiply the weekly time by 4 to find the total time spent in 4 weeks: 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours

However, this is the time spent in 4 weeks, but only 3 times a week.  To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the weekly time by 4 and then multiply by 3: 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours, then 36 hours * 3 = 108 hours.

However, this is incorrect.  The correct calculation is 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours, then 36 hours * 3 = 108 hours.  However, the 36 hours is the time spent in 4 weeks, 3 times a week.  The correct answer is 36 hours * 3 = 108 hours."
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the total number of students and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys') with 5 players each, so the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team.

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to determine the number of rubies and emeralds first. 

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds = 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems: 
Total gems = 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

Now, we know that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5

"To find the initial amount of money Bailey had, we need to consider the total amount she received from her weekly allowance and subtract it from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is $5 * 8 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the initial amount of money Bailey had by subtracting the total amount she received from her allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks:

Initial amount = Total amount at the end of 8 weeks - Total amount received from allowance
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

The initial amount of money Bailey had is $60."
"To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the price per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day for 5 weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

"To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- The second level has a square footage of 16 / 2 = 8.
- The third level has a square footage of 8 / 2 = 4.
- The fourth level has a square footage of 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to first determine the amount of laundry each of them does.

Let's start by finding the amount of laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can find David's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4
= 100 pounds

Now, let's find the amount of laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
= 200 pounds

Now that we have the amount of laundry each of them does, we can find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100

"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.

"To find the number of games the football team won, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W.

We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can express this as W = L + 8.

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. This can be expressed as W + L = 22.

Substituting W from the first equation into the second equation, we get (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2L = 14.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. Therefore, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. Therefore, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. For the 7th year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is $99. The salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089. For the 8th year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. The salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1. For the 9th year, the increase is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. The salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the amount eaten by adults: 20 adults * 10 pounds per adult = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount eaten by children. Since children eat half as much as adults, we multiply the number of children by half of the adult's consumption: 5 children * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amounts eaten by adults and children to find the total: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total number of pets, we need to determine the number of pets each person has. 

Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Now, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the age of Jackson, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children.

Let's start by determining Corey's age. Since James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, we can conclude that Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, we know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now, we are given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to determine his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can find Gerald's original time by adding 2 seconds to Lee's time. 

Lee's time is 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40 to find his new time. 
10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, cats, and dogs.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from 180, which gives us 168.

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 
Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, so the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the total number of tomatoes used by Freda, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, let's analyze the given information.

We know that a total of 25 cars drove through the traffic jam, and 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she initially has and then subtract the number she gives away.

First, we calculate the number of plants she already has on her window ledges. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, the total number of plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

However, she decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. Therefore, she will give away a total of 40 potted plants.

To find the number of plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5, and then add it to 20. This gives us 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read. 

The total number of pages is the sum of the pages from each textbook: 
4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.
39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day. He has 4 more days to complete his reading. To do this, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which it covers the city.

Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and we need to find the time it takes to cover this distance at a rate of 3 miles per 10 minutes.

First, we divide the total distance by the rate to find the number of 3-mile sections: 42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections.

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: 14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the volume of the inner space of each box and then multiply it by the number of boxes.

The dimensions of each box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, with 1-inch thick walls. To find the inner dimensions, we subtract the wall thickness from each side.

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the inner box is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the inner box is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's break down the time spent watching 1-hour episodes: 
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 * 1 = 2 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour
- Friday: 2 hours
Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours.

Now, let's find the total time spent watching TV: 7 hours.

The time spent watching 30-minute episodes is the difference between the total time and the time spent watching 1-hour episodes: 7 - 5 = 2 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 2 / 0.5 = 4.

However, we need to consider that Frankie watched 30-minute episodes on Thursday as well. We know he watched a 30-minute episode on Thursday, so we need to subtract 0.5 hours from the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes: 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of cookies Henry baked last year and the number he baked this year. Let's denote the number of cookies he baked last year as x.

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he accidentally bakes 15 more cookies than he intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, Henry is left with 110 cookies. This can be represented by the equation 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.

Therefore, the correct answer is 50."
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person consumed and then divide by 2.

Beatrice's roll-ups can be calculated by multiplying the width by the length: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups.

Similarly, Marcell's roll-ups can be calculated by multiplying the width by the length: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each: 48 + 42 = 90.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, which means the boat took on 2 liters of water for those 20 feet. To find the rate, we can divide the distance by the time: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can find the rate of water intake in liters per second. We know that 20 feet is 2 sets of 10 feet, so the boat takes on 2 * 2 = 4 liters for 20 feet. To find the rate, we can divide the water intake by the time: 4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters/second.

Now, let's find the total time it took to reach the shore: 64 seconds. We can multiply the rate of water intake by the total time to find the total water intake: 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the number of lessons and the frequency of cleaning.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo as 'x'. 

From the given information, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as an equation: 300 = 50x.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation 300 = 50x. Dividing both sides of the equation by 50, we get x = 300 / 50 = 6.

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, so the number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's consider Adrien's salary four years ago, which is given as $40000. Since his salary increased by 30% to be higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as 70% of Adrien's salary. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%. To find Adrien's new salary, we calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:

"To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can use the information that Jennie stamped one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. This means she stamped 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.

Since Jennie added 20 letters to the pile of already-stamped letters, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of letters in that pile. Let x be the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. The equation is x + 20 = 30, where 30 is the current number of letters in the pile.

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: x = 30 - 20.

x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the initial number of spoons Julia had before her husband gave her more spoons. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

When Julia's husband gave her 5 more spoons, the total number of spoons she had became x + 5. After using 3 spoons, the total number of spoons she had left was (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

We are given that after using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 2.

x = 10

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's determine the cost of each item. The cost of each pepper is given as $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the hospital's profit, we first need to determine the total time spent by doctors. This can be found by multiplying the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we calculate the total revenue for the hospital. This is done by multiplying the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then converting the result to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to calculate the number of elves that quit and subtract it from the initial number of elves.

First, let's find a third of the initial 60 elves. A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

Now, we subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial number: 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these elves from the remaining number: 40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

The expenditure in May is $500. The expenditure in June is $60 less than the expenditure in May. 

Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we can find the total expenditure by adding the expenditures in May and June.

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. 
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine the total miles walked on Tuesday. Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can find the miles walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of car washes per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenditure and then multiply it by 12.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. The total cost per month is the product of the number of car washes and the cost per car wash, which is 4 * $15 = $60.

Now, to find the total cost per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$60 * 12 = $720.

Therefore, the total cost of car washes per year is $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"To find the number of video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the total unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9

Now, we need to find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

Female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 2/3 * 9
= 2 * 3
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. However, Mark only had 8 hours, so he completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. However, Mark only had 6 hours, so he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in the second test.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175

Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70 = 105

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we first need to calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we multiply this number by 4.

4 * 12 = 48

Now, we are told that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. To find the total number of pink gumballs, we add 22 to the previous result.

48 + 22 = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Given that there are 20 available cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

The total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to separate the items into food and non-food categories and apply the tax accordingly.

First, let's calculate the cost of food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Next, we calculate the cost of non-food items and apply the 10% tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars
Tax on non-food items: 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar
Total cost of non-food items with tax: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has a total of 8 clients, with each client requiring 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, we find the total number of pineapples per hectare, which is given as 100 pineapples. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Next, we need to determine the number of harvests in a year. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces. 
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 
500 + 1500 = 2000
2000 + 125 = 2125

The total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 30 of these bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (from step 3) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

"To find the number of Facebook friends James has, we need to determine the number of friends Dorothy has first. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation to find the number of friends Dorothy has.

Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends. We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"To determine the winner of the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 5280 feet, and Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time taken by each of them to get home.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10.

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9.

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are (x - 30). 
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Let's break it down by day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we can convert this to inches by multiplying by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. Therefore, 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must calculate the monthly consumption of each type of ape and then multiply it by 2 to account for the 2-month period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons require 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to consider the price increase every two months. The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

We can use a geometric progression formula to calculate the price after 36 months. The formula for the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a1 = $20, r = 1.20 (since a 20% increase is equivalent to multiplying by 1.20), and n = 18 (since we are calculating the price after 36 months, which is 18 periods of 2 months each).

However, since the price increases every two months, we need to calculate the price after each period of 2 months. We can use the formula:

an = a1 * (1 + r)^n

where n is the number of periods of 2 months.

Let's calculate the price after each period of 2 months:

After 2 months: $20 * (1 + 1.20)^1 = $24
After 4 months: $24 * (1 + 1.20)^2 = $28.80
After 6 months: $28.80 * (1 + 1.20)^3 = $34.56
After 8 months: $34.56 * (1 + 1.20)^4 = $41.472
After 10 months: $41.472 * (1 + 1.20)^5 = $49.7664
After 12 months: $49.7664 * (1 + 1.20)^6 = $59.71968
After 14 months: $59.71968 * (1 + 1.20)^7 = $71.663416
After 16 months: $71.663416 * (1 + 1.20)^8 = $85.9960992
After 18 months: $85.9960992 * (1 + 1.20)^9 = $103.19531904
After 20 months: $103.19531904 * (1 + 1.20)^10 = $123.834382648
After 22 months: $123.834382648 * (1 + 1.20)^11 = $148.6012591776

"To determine the difference in cost between doing taxes herself and hiring an accountant, we need to consider the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

The income lost by doing the taxes herself is calculated as follows:
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income lost:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

The final answer is: $15"

"To determine the number of times Sandra needs to babysit, we must first calculate the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs and she's making 15, the total number of eggs needed is 3 * 15 = 45.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job, which is 9. Therefore, the calculation is 45 / 9.

To find the solution, we perform the division: 45 ÷ 9 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can express this relationship as an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the amount of money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has. Since Ethel has $8, we multiply this by 2 to get 2 * 8 = 16.

First, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Friday: 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

Next, we calculate the total miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

We are given that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Therefore, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so we can calculate her age by multiplying Sally Four's age by 2: 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so we can find her age by adding 3 to Granny Red's age: 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The increased minimum payment for the student loans is $300 * 1.5 = $450.
The increased minimum payment for the credit card is $200 * 1.5 = $300.
The increased minimum payment for the mortgage is $500 * 1.5 = $750.

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To determine the total time it takes to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's convert the time it takes to cut one potato from seconds to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Finally, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the cost of lemons, we need to first determine the total number of gallons sold and then calculate the cost of lemons per gallon.

Let's start by finding the total revenue. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

The profit is $25, so the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + Cost

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

We can now solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + Cost) / $10

However, we need to find the cost, which includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = Cost per gallon - Cost of sugar per gallon
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + Cost) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - $5 * Number of gallons = $25
$10 * (($25 + Cost) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + Cost) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
(10 - 5) * (($25 + Cost) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + Cost) / $10) = $25
(25 + Cost) / 2 = $25
25 + Cost = $50
Cost = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"

"To find the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.

Now, we subtract these two amounts from Zaid's monthly income to find the remaining amount: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: 1/2 of 3400 is 1700.

After the donation, we subtract this amount from the remaining amount: 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Next, we calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, we subtract this amount from the remaining amount to find the final result: 1700 - 900 = 800.

"To find the number of votes the loser received, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner obtained. Since the winner secured 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate this by multiplying 3/4 by the total number of students who voted, which is 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60 votes

Now that we know the winner received 60 votes, we can find the number of votes the loser received by subtracting the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

80 - 60 = 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we need to determine the number of white carnations first. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Mark's age two years ago as a variable, let's call it 'M - 2', where 'M' is Mark's current age. We are given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 

We can write an equation to represent the situation:
M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19

Now, we can solve for M by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:
M = 19 + 2
M = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = M + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

However, I made a slight miscalculation in my arithmetic. Let me recheck the math. 60 + 57 = 117, 117 + 54 = 171, 171 + 51 = 222. The total time for the less well-rounded team is indeed 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 222 = -2 seconds. However, since time cannot be negative, this indicates that the less well-rounded team actually finished first."
"To determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we consider the favorable outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. As the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to determine the number of apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing her mother's total by 2.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mother's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to find the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

"To determine the total pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they require per week. 

Given that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks in the flock, we can find the total pounds of insects needed per week by multiplying the pounds per duck by the number of ducks:

3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Now, to find the pounds of insects needed per day, we divide the total pounds per week by the number of days in a week, which is 7:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each publisher and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, x is also the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the amount he earns from Publisher A is 5x cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount he earns from Publisher B is 10x cents.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so x + x = 1000. This simplifies to 2x = 1000, and solving for x gives us x = 500.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount Mark earns from each publisher. The amount from Publisher A is 5 * 500 = 2500 cents, and the amount from Publisher B is 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he worked.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels per ton.

First, we find the total tons of grapes produced per year by multiplying the number of acres by the tons of grapes each acre produces:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton to find the total barrels of wine produced per year:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which has 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. Therefore, the total slices for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, we'll calculate the slices used for omelets. Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

Now, let's consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for each meal together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for each period and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks:
We have 25 kilometers per ride, 5 rides per week, and 4 weeks. This can be represented as 25 * 5 * 4. Multiplying these numbers together, we get 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks:
We have 60 kilometers per ride, 2 rides per week, and 3 weeks. This can be represented as 60 * 2 * 3. Multiplying these numbers together, we get 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods:
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. We are given that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the weight of each candied apple by the number of candied apples: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups. We are given that this cost is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is sold at $6000 each.

The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from this total to find the cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to determine the number of customers on the second day first. Since the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, we can calculate it as follows:

Customers on Day 1 = 100
Customers on Day 2 = Customers on Day 1 + 50
Customers on Day 2 = 100 + 50
Customers on Day 2 = 150

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day:

Total by Day 3 = 500
Customers on Day 1 and Day 2 = 100 + 150
Customers on Day 1 and Day 2 = 250
Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - Customers on Day 1 and Day 2
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Next, we find Adrian's age, which is three times the age of Harriet, resulting in 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"To find the points scored by Jojo, we need to first determine the points scored by the other three students. 

Let's start with Naomi, who scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of candies each person has.

Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has 2R candies. We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation 2R = 54.

Solving for R, we get R = 54 / 2 = 27. This means Robert has 27 candies.

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, James has R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of books read, we need to consider the number of books each person reads. Dolly has 2 books and reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, resulting in a total of 3 books read by Dolly.

Pandora has 1 book and reads her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, resulting in a total of 3 books read by Pandora.

Since both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books, we must not double-count the books they read from each other. Therefore, we simply add the total number of books read by each person: 3 (by Dolly) + 3 (by Pandora) = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's find the total minutes used for his daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Next, we add the extra minutes: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of fries Griffin had as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We know the following:

1. G = 24 (initial number of fries Griffin had)
2. K = 5 (number of fries Kyle took)
3. B = 2K = 10 (number of fries Billy took, since Billy took twice as many as Kyle)
4. C = K - 3 = 2 (number of fries Colby took, since Colby took 3 less than Kyle)
5. G - K - B + x - C = 27 (final number of fries Griffin had)

Substituting the known values, we get:
24 - 5 - 10 + x - 2 = 27

Combine like terms:
7 + x = 27

Now, solve for x:
x = 27 - 7
x = 20

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of snails and the number of fish in the two aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

7 = x

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine the daily cost, then multiply it by the number of days worked per week, and finally multiply that by the number of weeks.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day. Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist works 4 days a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After completing the movie, the makeup artist receives a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

To find the final amount Jean paid, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find the amount each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide it by the number of people splitting the cost.

The total cost of the party supplies is the sum of the individual costs:
- Cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents are splitting the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find the amount each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. 
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50.
Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then multiply it by the calories per cookie.

Let's start with Sue's sister. She ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. The total number of cookies she ate is 5 + 13 = 18.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate. On Monday, she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60. 

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we need to consider the changes in his app collection.

Initially, Travis had 61 apps. He then deleted 9 apps, which leaves him with 61 - 9 = 52 apps.

Following the deletion, Travis downloaded 18 new apps. To find the total number of apps now, we add the new apps to the remaining apps: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of wolves and the number of cougars killed.

Let's start with the cougars. We know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than he did last night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we are told that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

To find the total number of wolves killed, we add the number of wolves killed last night to the number killed today: 10 + 36 = 46.

To find the total number of cougars killed, we add the number of cougars killed last night to the number killed today: 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the total number of wolves and cougars: 46 + 27 = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To find the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to determine the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

We know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. To find 30% of 30, we multiply 0.3 by 30, which equals 9. 

Now, we subtract 9 from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 21 * 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: $\boxed{192}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies: 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.

Next, we'll calculate the value of the nickels: 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.

Then, we'll calculate the value of the dimes: 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.

Finally, we'll calculate the value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40.

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have.

Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as 'J'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has is J + 8. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation J + 8 = 52.

Solving for J, we get J = 52 - 8 = 44. This means Jamal has 44 apples.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is J + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, the number of bananas Andrea has is 48 / 2 = 24.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. She is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. To do this, we can divide 66 by 12 to find the number of dozens of cookies: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Since 5.5 dozens is equivalent to 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies require 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

Therefore, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300.

First, we can express two thirds as a decimal: 2/3 = 0.6667 (rounded to four decimal places).

Now, we multiply 9,300 by 0.6667 to find two thirds of 9,300: 9,300 * 0.6667 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount: 6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles she has and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find the total number of marbles in the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 * 50 = 250.

Next, we add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to the initial total: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in Harry's yard, we first need to determine the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, we calculate the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

Now, to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to determine the individual amounts first.

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee as a percentage of the selling price.

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees and then add the time it takes to cook.

First, let's find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Now, let's find the time it takes to cook. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to determine the total number of golf balls first. Since half of the balls the juggler can juggle are golf balls, we divide the total number of balls by 2.

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of blue golf balls, which is half of the golf balls.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. 
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 = 612
612 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we first need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, resulting in a total of 2 * 3 = 6 bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

In addition to the windows in the bedrooms, there are 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. With 2 houses, the total number of these additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 315.

The final answer is: $\boxed{315}$"
"To find the total amount of money spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

Next, we'll find the cost of the celery seeds: 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The total amount of money spent on seeds is $3200."
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

"To calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes. 

Next, we'll find the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours."
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We are given that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the 20 in the expression (M + m) + 20 is not the same as the 20 in the equation M + m = 20. The 20 in the expression (M + m) + 20 is actually the sum of 10 added to each of their ages.

So, the correct expression is (M + 10) + (m + 10) = (M + m) + 20. We know that M + m = 20, so we can substitute this value into the expression to get (20) + 20 = 40.

However, we are adding 10 to each of their ages, so we need to add 20 to the sum of their current ages. The correct answer is 40 + 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy for and then multiply that by the cost of each pizza.

First, let's find the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories written in the first week and the second week separately.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of these individual counts.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes.

First, let's find the total value of her quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

Next, we'll calculate the total value of her dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and dimes to find the total amount Kelly has: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

To find out how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop for 55 cents, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is the product of the number of flagstones and the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Weight capacity per truck
= 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
= 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of medals Ali and Izzy have and the total number of medals given out.

Let's denote the total number of medals given out as x. Since Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

The combined total of Ali and Izzy's medals is 22 + 17 = 39. According to the problem, this is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

39 = x - 10x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

39 = -9x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by -9:

x = 39 / -9
x = -4.33

However, the number of medals cannot be negative. This indicates that the problem statement contains an inconsistency. The correct interpretation would be that Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out, which means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's re-evaluate the problem statement:

39 = 10x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 39."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to find the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars given to the adults. Each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find the remaining chocolate bars for the children. This is done by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

To find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Let's start with the initial points of each player. Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points, and Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we can find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last by dividing the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

Target = 120 crates

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the total amount bid. Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, there are 3 bids made by the other people. After each of these bids, Carmen also bids, so there are 3 bids made by Carmen. In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 bids.

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 200, the common difference d = 50, and the number of terms n = 6.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the problem into several components.

First, let's determine the total miles driven per year. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily distance is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. With 5 days of work per week, the weekly distance is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Multiplying this by the number of weeks worked in a year (50 weeks), we get the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply this monthly bonus by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Now, we can find the total cost per year by adding the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 

The combined time for Monday and Sunday is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Twice the combined minutes is 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding pattern. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. 

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the amount of money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

First, let's find the amount she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of $50, we can calculate this as $50 / 2 = $25.

Next, we add the additional $10 she spent on rides to the amount spent on food and snacks: $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine the number of books she sold in the second year. 

Given that Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years, and there are currently 50 unsold books, we can calculate the total number of books sold over the three years as follows:

Total books sold = Total books - Unsold books
= 250 - 50
= 200

We also know that Elise sold 45 books this year and twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:

Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year
= 2 * 45
= 90

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first year and the current year from the total books sold:

Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - Books sold in the first year - Books sold this year
= 200 - 90 - 45
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we need to calculate his total hours worked and his total earnings from both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Since April has 4 weeks, we can calculate Watson's total earnings for the month by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, as he beat 80% of the people.

20% of 20 can be calculated as 0.2 * 20 = 4.

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the total loaves are sold in the morning. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60. Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find the number of loaves left after the morning sales. This is done by subtracting the morning sales from the total number of loaves: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we need to find half of 20. This is calculated as 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, not 2 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4.

The number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds is 4 weeks. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we multiply 4 weeks by 4: 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

Extra arms: 
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. 
- In 15 days, the person will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Extra legs: 
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. 
- In 15 days, the person will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = extra arms + extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses and savings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times this amount is $500. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost) = $4050.

However, Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. To find out how much he has left for gifts, we subtract the amount he wants to save from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find the total number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat 3 eggs each day. This is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

Next, we find the total number of eggs consumed by the remaining family members, which is 2 people eating 2 eggs each. This is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to determine the age of Jane first. Since Quinn is 30 years old and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age to find Trent's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Noah and Cera, and then use that information to find the current population of Chile.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Cera was 40 years old, and Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was 20 years old. This means that N - 6 = 20, which implies N = 26.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"To find the number of players on the defense, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2. We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited to Martha's party, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

The number of people from the 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12.
The number of people from the 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12.
Therefore, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. We subtract these people from the remaining number of people invited: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate its volume in cubic feet. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: length x width x height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can now calculate the volume:
Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Next, we need to find the total cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total number of people who left the party. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and there were 40 people initially, we can calculate the number of people who left as 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Now, we know that 10 people left, and we are given that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Since 10 people left in total, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - 7 = 8.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost by dividing the book's cost by 2.

The cost of the magazine is $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. We are told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can calculate the pen's cost by subtracting $1 from the magazine's cost.

The cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

"To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream separately, then add them together.

Let's start by finding the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To find the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to consider the ratio of old records to new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can use this ratio to find the total number of old records traded. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the total number of old records traded is twice the number of new records.

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in. However, this is not necessary to find the total number of old records brought in.

The total number of old records brought in is equal to the number of old records traded, which is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers

"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the total time required to charge the remaining 40% of the battery. Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time by multiplying the remaining percentage points by the charging rate.

40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops she has after receiving additional lollipops from her mother and then subtract the number she gives away.

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip and apply them to the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On the current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the total income, subtract the property tax, and then subtract the income tax for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. Since there's no property tax mentioned, we'll proceed with the income tax calculation. The income tax is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Subtracting the income tax from the total income, we get $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 as the net income.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Subtracting the income tax from the net income before tax, we get $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400 as the net income.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs. The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to determine the total number of ruined castles. This can be calculated by finding 40% of the total number of castles, which is 220.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we then divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

For Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find the number of guns each person would have if they were shared equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and then divide by the number of people.

First, let's add up the total number of guns: 
DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4.
24 / 4 = 6

Therefore, if the guns were shared equally, each person would have 6 guns.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must calculate the amount required for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, we find the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers: 8 * 30 ounces = 240 ounces.

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge: 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

The initial price of each share is $8. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which means the new price is 1.5 times the initial price. Therefore, the price of each share after the first year is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which means the new price is 75% of the price after the first year. Therefore, the price of each share after the second year is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Since Maria buys 8 shares, the total value of all shares after the second year is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. This can be represented by the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to determine the number of cows and chickens and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We know that H = 2C, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so H + C = 60. Substituting H = 2C into this equation, we get 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to consider his initial number of balls and the changes that occur during the talent show.

Josh starts by juggling 3 balls. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his act, so after 4 weeks, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

When Josh drops 3 balls on stage, 2 are caught by the crowd, but 1 is lost. To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the lost ball from the total: 7 - 1 = 6.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weights of all the animals involved.

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, which is 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of the original distance, we divide 5000 meters by 5.

5000 / 5 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this to the original distance to find the new daily distance.

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine their respective prices. 

Juice Box A is priced at 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. 

Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we can find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of legs in the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and add them together.

First, let's find the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we'll find the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies used by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies.

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

The discount amount is 40% of $30, which can be calculated as 0.4 * $30 = $12.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt. The discounted price of one shirt is $30 - $12 = $18.

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost. The total cost is $18 * 2 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to first calculate the original and current daily earnings.

The original daily earnings from selling tractors is 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day.

The current daily earnings from selling silos is 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.

The difference in the daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find the monthly cost of food for her dog. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats and medicine to the monthly food cost:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Now, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the total annual cost:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

"To find the total time for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

Let's start with Monday's yoga class, which lasts for 1 hour. On Tuesday, Peyton has a cooking class that is three times as long as Monday's yoga, so the cooking class lasts for 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

On Wednesday, Peyton attends a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. On Thursday, the museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class, so it lasts for 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

Finally, on Friday, Peyton has 2 hours of errands.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"

April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. She also needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the amount Andrea saved, we need to determine the initial amount of money she had and subtract the total amount she spent from it.

Let's denote the amount Andrea saved as 'x'. The total amount she spent is the sum of the cost of the sweater and the money she gave her brother, which is $11 + $4 = $15.

The initial amount of money Andrea had is $36. After spending $15, she was left with $36 - $15 = $21. This amount is the sum of the money she saved and the money she spent, so we can set up the equation:

x + $15 = $36

To find the amount Andrea saved, we need to isolate 'x' in the equation. We can do this by subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation:

x = $36 - $15
x = $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount spent
Amount saved = $36 - $15
Amount saved = $21

This is still incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the equation. The correct equation is:

x + $15 = $36

To find the amount Andrea saved, we need to isolate 'x' in the equation. We can do this by subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation:

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities and then determine 40% of that total.

First, let's find the time spent on boating and swimming. Since he spent half the time swimming as he did boating, and he spent 6 hours boating, the time spent swimming is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, we'll calculate the time spent watching shows. He watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
30% of total time = 6 hours
0.30 * total time = 6
Total time = 6 / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 40% of 20 hours
= 0.40 * 20
= 8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Total earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first determine the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the height of the two trees combined. This can be calculated as 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and then subtract that from the total amount he received.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially received $28 and got an extra $10, so he now has $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35.

"To find the total amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's find out how much she spends on lollipops each day. Since each lollipop costs $0.25, 4 lollipops will cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

"To find the amount of candy Billy bought, we need to determine how much money he had left after buying the candy and then use that information to calculate the cost of the candy.

Let's denote the amount of candy Billy bought as 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

Billy started with $10. After buying the candy, he had 10 - 1.5x dollars left.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. Since Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can express this relationship as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

"To determine the number of days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.

First, let's find the distance from the third city to the first city. This distance is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we can find the total distance traveled in one trip by adding the distances from the first city to the second city, from the second city to the third city, and from the third city to the first city.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train travels this route 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 3 times the total distance in one trip.

Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.

Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. This is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2.

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to consider the distance and speed for both the trip to the friend's house and the return trip.

The distance to the friend's house is 200 miles, but due to a detour, the actual distance becomes 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. The speed for this part of the trip is 70 mph.

Time taken to drive to the friend's house = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

For the return trip, the distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph.

Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to the friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Total required points = 42
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we need to break down the given information.

Let's start by determining the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. This is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as follows:

Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting = 4 * 3 - 5
= 12 - 5
= 7

Next, we need to find the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting:

Number of customers kicked out for physical violence = 3 * 7
= 21

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

Number of customers kicked out for other reasons = Total number of customers kicked out - (Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks + Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting + Number of customers kicked out for physical violence)
= 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)
= 50 - 31
= 19

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of etching for all frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. Therefore, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To calculate the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to find the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Friday is 14 * 2 = 28.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 * 2 = 56.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is (2 * 14 * 2) / 2 = 28.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. The number of shoes returned is 12, but we need to consider the number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 28. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the number of shoes returned is 12 * 2 = 24. Subtracting the number of shoes returned from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, we get 28 - 24 = 4.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 4 (Sunday) = 88.

The final answer is: 88"

"To find the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours spent running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

The profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so we multiply the number of sandwiches by the amount of each ingredient per sandwich.

Meat needed: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese needed: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Next, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound.

Meat cost: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese cost: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, we find the total number of words in the book by multiplying the number of pages by the number of words per page: 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.

Next, we divide the total number of words by Toby's reading rate to find the time it takes him to read the book: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, we add this to the reading time to find the total time Toby will be at the airport: 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there to find out how many minutes early he will be: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to find the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find the total cost of the items Sally bought, we need to calculate the cost of the taffy, the mixed bag of seashells, and the magnets separately.

The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume in 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we multiply this rate by the number of nights:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies this is. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. The more dangerous candles are the ones that are not guaranteed to not explode, which is 1% of the total candles. So, the number of more dangerous candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. This is 5% of the more dangerous candles, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and set up an equation to find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as 'x'. 

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister also gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

Since the sisters don't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x. The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation based on this information:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days. It's given that this distance is 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:
800 km * 0.3 = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to establish the relationship between the lockers. 

Let's start with Peter's locker, which is given as 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb is, we need to determine the point where it landed after falling from his initial position. 

Stanley's initial elevation is 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. To find the elevation of the comb, we subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Elevation of the comb = Initial elevation - Distance fallen
Elevation of the comb = 10,000 - 4,000
Elevation of the comb = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Distance Oliver must climb = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's elevation
Distance Oliver must climb = 6,000 - 3,000
Distance Oliver must climb = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount of money he received from the banks and add it to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

First, let's find the total number of months in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would have 2 * 12 = 24 months.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the cost of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J.

We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. This can be expressed as J = T - 6.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting J from the first equation into the second equation, we get (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"

The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. Since each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, and the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since Lillian made 3 homemade bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and Lillian bought 3 of them, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the bagel is $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To find the total number of cards Kenny started with, we need to consider the amount of money he has after selling the cards and the fact that he kept 1/3 of the cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards he sold is equal to the total number of cards minus the number of cards he kept, which is 2/3x.

The total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards he sold multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5. This amount is $50, as he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100.

We can set up the equation:

2/3x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:

x = $50 * (3/2) / $1.5
x = $50 * 2 / $3
x = $100 / $3
x = 33.33 * 3
x = 100

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can verify that 33.33 * 3 is indeed 100, and 100 / 3 is indeed 33.33. Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is 100 / 3 * 3 = 100 / (3/3) = 100 / 1 = 100."
"To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared and how many were needed.

The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. This means 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs, resulting in 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. For the other half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Set of pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we'll calculate the discount:
Discount = 20% of $165.00
Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

Now, we'll calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

"To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to determine the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew first.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is calculated as 100 * (3/4) = 75.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Now, we convert 3 gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Next, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. To do this, we multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 3/4

Now, we convert 3/4 gallons to pints by multiplying 3/4 by 8.

3/4 * 8 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money George spent on candy bars. 

First, let's find the total amount of money George spent. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending, he spent 99% of his money. If 1% of his money is $0.01, then 99% of his money is $4.99.

Now, let's find the amount of money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, 3 bags of chips cost 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533. However, since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to determine the number of lollipops he shared and then divide that by the number of friends.

Ray had a total of 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. To find the number of lollipops he shared, we subtract the number he kept from the total: 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to determine the weight of the cake that was consumed by Rory and her mom. 

Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so the total weight of the cake they consumed is 2 times the weight of each piece.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's determine the cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to it.

Let's denote the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater as W. Since it takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne to get to the theater, the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 4W.

Given that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can substitute W = 4 into the equation for Bernadette's time: 4W = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. Since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. This means she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we must convert the length to feet.

Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 3 yards is equivalent to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

With the length and width known, we can calculate the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each of them has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Let's start by converting Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C and then use it to determine the length of Movie B. 

Movie C is given as 1.25 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

75 minutes (Movie C) + 5 minutes = 80 minutes (Movie B)

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find its length by dividing the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes (Movie B) / 4 = 20 minutes (Movie A)

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance it runs. Given that the horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour, we must convert the time to hours.

30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Now, we can calculate the distance by multiplying the speed by the time: 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat a total of 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Now, we know that each tray holds 5 glasses. To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray: 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the current score difference between Joey and Marcy, we need to calculate their total points after their respective turns.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we calculate the difference between their total points to find out by how many points Joey is winning.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The total number of crayons Beatrice bought is 112."
"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. We know that S = $3.

We are given two scenarios:

1. Buying a super ticket for $20, which includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. Buying a regular ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at their regular prices.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the regular ticket is $12. The difference between the two is $20 - $12 = $8. This $8 difference is the cost of the soda and popcorn in the super ticket.

Since the soda costs $3, the remaining amount, $8 - $3 = $5, is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. However, this is the cost of the popcorn when it's included with the super ticket. To find the regular price of the popcorn, we need to subtract the $1 extra cost from the super ticket.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $5 - $1 = $4.

However, we know that the extra $1 is for both the popcorn and the soda. If we subtract the cost of the soda ($3) from the $5, we get the cost of the popcorn: $5 - $3 = $2.

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to determine the original cost of filling one balloon.

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11050}$"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours is given by the product of the speed and time, which is 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles. Similarly, the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour is 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the individual times, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate their combined daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Now, we multiply their combined daily consumption by the number of days:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are given as 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.

The volume of one bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

35%"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, the carrots weigh 48 pounds, the hay weighs 3150 pounds, and the oats weigh 1300 pounds. 

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips. The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles.

First, let's find the value of the aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Next, we calculate the value of the plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Now, we add the values of the cans and bottles to find the total weekly earnings: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total monthly earnings: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to determine the number of plants Toni has first. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them and then find the difference.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. The total cost of the apples is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since she received a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. Converting this to dollars, we get 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. The total cost of the apples is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since she received a 10% discount, we calculate the discount as 10% of 1000 cents, which is 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Subtracting the discount from the total cost, we get 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. Converting this to dollars, we get 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amounts paid by Kelly and Becky. This is simply $9 - $8 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is 6.

"To find the number of books each child received, we need to determine the total number of books purchased and then divide that by the number of children.

The total amount spent on books is $300, and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since the books are divided equally among 4 children, we divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle allows us to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9, the number allergic to peanuts is 6, and the number allergic to both is 3. 

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 + 6 = 15

Then, we subtract the number allergic to both: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides in each group: 3 * 7 = 21.

Finally, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 + 21 = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we first need to determine the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for two people is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price to get the new price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 + 9 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Since it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate this by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains. 

To find three-quarters of 48 grains, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

48 * 3 = 144
144 / 4 = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny.

36 + 48 = 84

"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn, we must first calculate the total amount they have already earned. This can be done by adding the individual amounts earned by Keegan and Tashay.

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91
Total earnings: $83 + $91 = $174

Now, we subtract the total earnings from the goal to find the remaining amount needed.

Goal: $200
Remaining amount needed: $200 - $174 = $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we need to first determine the number of songs each of them can add to their players.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and since it can store up to 100 songs, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so he has 3 * 20 = 60 songs. Therefore, he can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

The difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to determine the number of oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

First, multiply 60 by 2: 60 * 2 = 120
Then, divide 120 by 5: 120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 * $10 = $240

"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we can find the total miles run in a week by multiplying the miles run per day by the number of days.

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours James runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed of 10 miles per hour.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we must first calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, resulting in a daily consumption of 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse.

With 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. To find the total consumption for 5 days, we multiply this by 5, yielding 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total consumption by the weight of a single bag to find the number of bags needed: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

Therefore, the child will need 4 days to save the remaining amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per pie: 120 / 3 = 40.

Therefore, the correct answer is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation that represents the cost of each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 for each guest, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides to isolate the variable:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20 to solve for x:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting B represent the number of insects Bodhi found. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We are also given that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by the three is 43. We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/4 to get the yards used by Mariah:
364 * 1/4 = 364/4 = 91 yards

Next, let's find the yards used by her grandma. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/2 to get the yards used by her grandma:
364 * 1/2 = 364/2 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

"To find the length of the couch, we need to determine the width of the rug first. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate the rug's width as follows:

Rug's width = Chair's width + 5
Rug's width = 3 + 5
Rug's width = 8 feet

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can calculate this as follows:

Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8
Twice the width of the rug = 16 feet
Couch's length = Twice the width of the rug + 2
Couch's length = 16 + 2
Couch's length = 18 feet

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to consider the total cost and the number of packs of each type of gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x. The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1.

The total cost of all the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry, grape, and green apple gum. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 3 = 7. To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

Let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood. A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the weekly cost of bus trips, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips Janet takes in a week.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, we need to find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to calculate the number of animals at each location and then add them together.

First, let's determine the number of cows at the zoo. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we know the zoo has 20 sheep. To find the number of sheep at the farm, we need to determine the ratio of sheep at the farm to the zoo. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the values of x and y, where x is the number of onions and y is the number of potatoes.

Given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can express this relationship as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, we are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This information allows us to set up the equation:
x + y = 4(x + y)
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Simplifying the equation:
16 = 4x + 4y

Divide both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can express x in terms of y:
x = 4 - y

Substituting the value of x in the equation x + y = 4:
(4 - y) + y = 4
4 = 4

This equation is true for any value of y. However, we know that Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can set y = 4 and find the value of x:
x + 4 = 4
x = 0

So, Sophia bought 0 onions and 4 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight. 

Since his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"To determine Gerald's remaining funds, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run and then multiply it by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run:
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find 20% of $500, which is the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100
Remaining money after buying clothes = $500 - $100 = $400

Next, we'll find 25% of the remaining money, which is the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100
Remaining money after buying CDs = $400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the cost of the house, we can denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To calculate the profit earned by Tara, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue from selling the canvas bags.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. The total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: profit = $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight in minutes and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. Therefore, the total time of the fight is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To find the number of cookies Kelsie made, we need to determine the number of cookies Josh made first. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

36 (Suzanne's cookies) / 4 = 9 (Josh's cookies)

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find Kelsie's cookies, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2:

9 (Josh's cookies) * 2 = 18 (Kelsie's cookies)

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has:
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we first need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we multiply 2 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes. We can express this as an equation: Royce's time = 2 * Rob's time + 40 minutes.

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = 2 * 120 + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is 280 minutes."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item:

- Hats: 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to determine the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and then subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

The bakery sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

Now, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves baked: 200 - 132 = 68.

However, the grocery store also returned 6 unsold loaves, so we need to add those back to the total: 68 + 6 = 74.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is 74.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to determine the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips separately.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 / 6 = 6.

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's find the weekly consumption before and after adding the device. 

Daily consumption before adding the device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption before adding the device: 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour

Daily consumption after adding the device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption after adding the device: 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour

Now, let's calculate the cost before and after adding the device. The cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50.

Cost before adding the device: 84 * $1.50 = $126
Cost after adding the device: 98 * $1.50 = $147

"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we first need to establish the rate at which one person paints a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate their rate as follows:

Rate = 0.5 house / 5 days = 0.1 house per day

Now, we can calculate the combined rate of 5 people:

Combined rate = 5 people * 0.1 house per person per day = 0.5 house per day

Since 5 people can paint 0.5 houses in one day, they can paint 1 house in 1 / 0.5 = 2 days.

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply by 24:

Time in hours = 2 days * 24 hours per day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of chairs and sofas each person has. 

Let's start with Ophelia. We know she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. If we denote the number of chairs as C and the number of sofas as S, we can express this relationship as S = C - 2. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can substitute S = 20 into the equation and solve for C: 20 = C - 2, C = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has. We are told Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can express this relationship as S = C - 2. We know Jenna has 66 chairs, so we can substitute C = 66 into the equation and solve for S: S = 66 - 2, S = 64.

Now that we know the number of sofas and chairs each person has, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture. The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to determine the number of CDs he could have purchased with the money spent on the headphone set.

Let's calculate the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set. 

Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set.
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that could have been bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 10

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios in his workout routine.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours. Since there are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, we multiply 6 by 4 to get the total hours for these weeks: 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, we consider the weeks where he spent 5 hours. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, so we multiply 2 by 5 to get the total hours for these weeks: 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Lastly, we need to account for the week where he spent 6 hours. Since there is only 1 week where he spent 6 hours, we multiply 1 by 6 to get the total hours for this week: 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours from each scenario: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To find the difference in their current ages, we need to first determine the ages of Jame and his cousin in 8 years. 

Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C. We know that in 5 years, Jame will be 27, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, Jame's age will be J + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30. We are also given that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as C + 8 = 2(30) - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get C + 8 = 60 - 5, which gives us C + 8 = 55. Solving for C, we get C = 55 - 8 = 47.

Now that we have the current ages of Jame and his cousin, we can find the difference in their ages: J - C = 22 - 47 = -25. However, since age cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the difference: | -25 | = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer costs $1,100, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls.

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells more than the boys.

So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the initial number of candies George had as 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

When George ate 5 candies, he was left with x - 5 candies. We are given that George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

Solving for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Anne's age, we need to determine Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Chenny's age = 10
Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

The number of vlogs Emma made in the first week is 18, in the second week is 21, and in the third week is 15. 

First, we add these numbers together to find the total number of vlogs she has made so far:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total number of vlogs made from the total number of vlogs Emma aims to make:
72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

The total amount you paid is $60."
"To find the final amount the eldest boy has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

First, we divide the total amount ($18) by the number of boys (3) to find the eldest boy's initial share: $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he adds $5 to his share, resulting in $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he adds another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount Elvis must save each day in the second half of the month to meet his target of $1125.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. If we let y be the amount saved in the first half, then the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Since Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

We also know that x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30, and x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the difference in the earnings of Jairus and Jenny, we need to calculate their individual totals and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. 
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. 
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we calculate the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total.
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the amount Jeff gets, let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we need to find the total miles he walks in a week. Since he works 5 times a week, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works: 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which gives us 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is the sum of the letters from the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is the sum of the letters from the first two steps and the re-write: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

"To find the number of families notified in the fourth round of calls, we can analyze the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified, for a total of 3 + 9 = 12 families.
In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified, for a total of 12 + 27 = 39 families.
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified, for a total of 39 + 81 = 120 families.

However, the question asks for the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, not the cumulative total. Therefore, the correct answer is the number of new families notified in the fourth round, which is 81.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate this by multiplying 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 * $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 * $10 = $10

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the decimal equivalent of 10%): $30 * 0.1 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of the items, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and add them together.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales over $1000.

The commission for the first $1000 is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the sales over $1000, we need to calculate the amount of sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission for these sales is 10% of $1500, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000 to get the total commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

To find the number of additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day and then multiply it by 3 to find the time for 3 miles. 

First, we find the time to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that this time is twice the time to swim a mile on a cold day, plus 2 minutes. The time to swim a mile on a cold day is 16 minutes. 

Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 2 * 16 + 2
= 32 + 2
= 34 minutes

Now, we multiply this time by 3 to find the time to swim 3 miles on a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 34 * 3
= 102 minutes

We also need to find the time to swim 3 miles on a cold day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 16 * 3
= 48 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48

"To determine the number of cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. 

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, her intake is x/2. Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, his current intake is 10 * (x/2) = 5x.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the angle the sun moves over a period of time.

Given that the sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour and it moves for 10 hours, we can calculate the total angle moved by the sun as follows:

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 50 degrees

Now, we add this angle to the initial angle of the pyramid to find the final angle from the ground to the sun:

Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages she read in the first week and add it to the total pages she read in the second week.

First, let's find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, we need to convert the total minutes to pages. Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the age of Shiloh's nephew, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is the sum of the roses ordered by each shop: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's determine the cost of making 10 sandwiches. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches. The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they are making 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments, which costs $30.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost: 
Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

To find the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of sandwiches sold by the price per sandwich. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Finally, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the cost of labor.

First, we calculate the area of the bedroom by multiplying its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet, which is $12 per square foot. Therefore, the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the materials by adding the cost of the carpet, padding, and removing the old carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

The total cost of labor is the sum of the cost of removing the old carpet and installing the new carpet: $864 + $7344 = $8208.

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

First, we start with the initial value of 20. 

Next, we calculate half of this value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Then, we add the initial value to half of it, resulting in 20 + 10 = 30.

After that, we divide the sum by 5, giving us 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the result by the initial value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the final value is 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we need to determine the number of cards each of them has and then add them together.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. This can be calculated by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature she should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we need to subtract 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply it by 0.3.
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this value from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought and then add them together.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

However, this information is not necessary to find the cost per pair of contacts. We can directly calculate the cost per pair by finding the total cost of the contacts and dividing it by the total number of pairs.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories burned from her activities.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she spends 2 hours doing aerobics. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she spends 1 hour running. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are.

1600 / 200 = 8

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total amount of water needed.

8 * 100 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to calculate the sum of the three measurements and then divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to break down the information given.

First, we consider the people invited via email. Each of the 100 invited people will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, we consider the people invited by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, resulting in a total of 10 + 8 = 18 additional people.

To find the total number of people attending, we sum the people invited via email and the people invited by Alex's friends, which is 300 + 18 = 318. However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her.

Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: $\boxed{319}$"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To determine the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than 20 feet, given that the beanstalk doubles in height every day.

Since the beanstalk starts at 4 feet, we can express its height as 4 * 2^n, where n is the number of days.

We need to find the smallest value of n such that 4 * 2^n > 20.

Let's try different values of n:

n = 1: 4 * 2^1 = 8 (less than 20)
n = 2: 4 * 2^2 = 16 (less than 20)
n = 3: 4 * 2^3 = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we first need to determine the protein content in the amount of mushrooms he eats daily. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find the daily protein intake, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's analyze the problem: Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We can represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. This situation can be expressed as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total amount of money Colby has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find the number of gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the plane's rate of travel.

The plane's rate can be calculated by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took to travel that distance. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we first need to determine their individual hourly production rates.

Ruiz's hourly production rate can be found by dividing his total production by the number of hours it takes him to produce that amount. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, his hourly rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's hourly production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's hourly rate. Therefore, Marissa's hourly rate is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates produced by each of them in 12 hours. Ruiz's total production is 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa's total production is 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the first four hours. Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total amount earned from the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the total amount earned from both periods to find the total amount earned in 6 hours.
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can handle and then divide that by the number of rotations per month.

First, let's find the total number of rotations per month. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per 2 miles.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * (725 rotations / 2 miles)
Rotations per month = 400 * 362.5
Rotations per month = 145,000

Now, we can find the number of months the tires can last by dividing the total allowed rotations by the rotations per month.

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

To find the number of years, we divide the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the discount and then add the prices of the shirt and shorts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt: 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.5

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.5 = $17.5

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.5 + $35 = $52.5

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase:
Amount left = $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-2.5"
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we find the amount of butter needed per croissant. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the amount of butter per croissant, we divide the amount of butter per dozen by 12:
(1/4 pound/dozen) / 12 croissants/dozen = 1/48 pound/croissant

Now, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per croissant:
336 croissants * (1/48 pound/croissant) = 7 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the increased funding for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is a straightforward $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial funding. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the increased funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months. This is simply the increased funding multiplied by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

To find the total cost of the research, we add the cost for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each will be 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's determine the cost of the fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each will be 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

We also need to include the cost of the fish food, which is $2.00.

Lastly, we add the cost of the aquarium, which is $10.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

The final answer is: $33.00"
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its growth over time.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. 
In the second week, it doubled in height, so it was 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.
In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it was 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to determine the total number of seats. Since there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is calculated as follows:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we calculate the remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Then, we find the number of seats occupied by the parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we determine the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

First, we find the total number of poles at all intersections. Since each intersection has 6 poles and there are 4 intersections, the total number of poles is 6 * 4 = 24.

Each pole has 4 street lights, so the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 of these street lights are not functioning. To find the total number of functioning lights, we subtract the non-functioning lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then sum those values.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times, so it has 1000 - 356 = 644 times left.
DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 times left.

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: 1509"

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's find out how many pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

In addition to the pieces he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is:

4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, let's subtract the total number of pieces he chews from the initial amount of gum:

20 (initial pieces) - 6 (pieces chewed) = 14 pieces

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we need to divide the remaining gum by 2:

14 / 2 = 7 pieces

Now, let's subtract the number of pieces he gives to his sister from the remaining gum:

14 - 7 = 7 pieces

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to determine her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

Current age = 16 - 12
Current age = 4

Now, we add 4 to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now:
Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4
Age 4 years from now = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the difference in the amounts spent by the two coaches, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then to Mb/hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. Therefore, to convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find the speed in Mb/hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference in height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference in height by his growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height and ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine James' earnings, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total cost: 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we find the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit: 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to determine the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate this as follows:

100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate this as follows:

25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we can find the number of men who can stay upright by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
= (4/5) * 2000
= 4 * 400
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck and rose stamps. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

To find the number of rose stamps, we need to subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps: 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed between them. This is calculated by subtracting Bob's speed from Tom's speed, which gives us 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up, we divide this distance by the relative speed.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of fish Tommy caught, we need to determine the number of fish Darren caught first. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes attended at $6 per class as x and the number of classes attended at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

If x = 6, 6(6) + 10y = 60
36 + 10y = 60
10y = 24
y = 2.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 7, 6(7) + 10y = 60
42 + 10y = 60
10y = 18
y = 1.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 8, 6(8) + 10y = 60
48 + 10y = 60
10y = 12
y = 1.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 9, 6(9) + 10y = 60
54 + 10y = 60
10y = 6
y = 0.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 10, 6(10) + 10y = 60
60 + 10y = 60
10y = 0
y = 0

Since x = 10 and y = 0 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 10 classes at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

However, this would mean he misses 0 classes, which is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss.

If x = 9, y = 0.6, which is not a whole number. However, if we round down to the nearest whole number, x = 9 and y = 0 is the closest solution we have.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. 

Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up an equation to find Lynn's distance: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3. Substituting Reggie's distance, we get 20 = Lynn's distance + 3.

To solve for Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: Lynn's distance = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first determine the cost of one apple and then multiply it by 5. The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. Now, we multiply this by 5 to find the cost of 5 apples: $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first determine the cost of one orange and then multiply it by 5. The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10. Now, we multiply this by 5 to find the cost of 5 oranges: $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

Volume = length * width * depth

Given the dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now that we have the volume of the hole, we can calculate the time it will take Bob to dig it. Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

The final answer is: $43,500"
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

"To find the total cost of James' purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500.

Next, we'll find the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can calculate this as 1/5 * $750 = $150 per dress pant. Therefore, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and there are 10 suits. So, the total number of dress shirts is 10 * 3 = 30. The cost of each dress shirt is $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to dig through the soil. Since Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, we divide the total feet of soil by his rate: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill digs half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. We divide the total feet of clay by his rate: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To find the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3 weeks between the initial and the 70 times increase. Instead, we are told that she received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes after the 3 weeks, we need to subtract the initial likes from the likes after 3 weeks: 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks: 138000 + 20000 = 158000.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$540 - $398 = $142

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month.

Let's start with the first month. We know that her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. If we let x be the total sales from green hats, then x/2 = $400. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = $800.

So, in the first month, her total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400. The total sales in the first month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage, we need to determine the number of paid hours and the cost of each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost of the first hour is $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

First, let's calculate the expected total in her account if she received her full wage.

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves. 

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we need to find 2/3 of the total pages since she has already completed 1/3 of the paper.

The total number of pages is 15. To find 1/3 of 15, we multiply 15 by 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 15 by 3.

1/3 * 15 = 15 / 3 = 5

Since Shiela has completed 5 pages, we subtract this from the total number of pages to find the number of pages left to write.

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
Pages left to write = 15 - 5
Pages left to write = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish reading the book.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the total cooking time, we need to determine the cooking time for each food item and then sum them up.

Let's start with the rice. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

Next, we know that it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Now, we need to find the cooking time for beans. It's given that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, and since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, we can write the equation S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5.

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

"To find the total amount of money the three individuals have, we need to determine the amount each one possesses.

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, we need to add up the money of all three and divide it by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared it equally. 
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.
Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"To find the number of books Sally has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can express Janey's books as 2x + 3.

Given that Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to establish its current height in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches by dividing the difference by the growth rate of 30 inches per day:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, requiring 8 additional toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12.

When James returns, there are twice as many more dogs as when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. The total number of dogs is now 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Each dog needs 1 toy, so James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40.

However, when James returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37}$"

"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we first calculate the total signatures they have so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can determine the number of signatures they need to collect per week by dividing the total signatures needed by the number of weeks.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"

"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to establish the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 6:36. This ratio can be simplified to 1:6 by dividing both terms by 6.

Now, we can use this simplified ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes. We can set up a proportion:

1 potato / 6 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

x = 96 * 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has.

Let's start with Katarina, who has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, we can calculate Max's cookies as 68 + 5 = 73.

Next, we know the Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so we subtract 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we add 23 to Max's total: 73 + 23 = 96.

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the total added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length and then 20cm was added. Let's call the original length 'x'. 

The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

Now, we need to find the time it took for the rabbit mode. We are given that it took 40 minutes in rabbit mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44

The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of one of the twins. The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. 

Given that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

The cost of 4 candies is then $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

Dividing the cost of 4 candies by 4 gives us the cost of one candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

Let's start by determining the number of squares of each color:
- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the number of regular chairs the restaurant has, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. 

Total number of adults = 42
Total number of babies = 15
Total number of chairs needed = 42 + 15 = 57

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs available in the restaurant. 

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 40
Total number of chairs available = 8 + 40 = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"

"To find the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

"To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we need to determine the total number of dumplings eaten by the group of friends.

First, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Next, we need to find the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we can find the total number of dumplings eaten by the group by adding the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to determine the fraction of the cat's speed that the turtle's speed represents. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, the turtle's speed is 1/5 of the cat's speed.

Given the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find the amount they raise per hour. 

The amount raised in the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first determine the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for industrial purposes is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 8%."

"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The cost of 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
- The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
- The cost of 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
- The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 10% of $50.00 is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that for every 3 scoops purchased, Erin pays for 2 scoops, effectively reducing the cost to $3.00 for 3 scoops.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, Erin can calculate the number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy with her $6.00 by dividing $6.00 by $3.00.

$6.00 / $3.00 = 2

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is a total of 6 scoops. However, she has $0.00 remaining, indicating she cannot afford to buy any additional scoops.

Therefore, the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in that time period and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. 

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate two thirds of the bathroom's area. The bathroom is 36 sq ft, so we calculate (2/3) * 36.

To do this, we multiply 2 by 36, which equals 72, and then divide by 3. 72 divided by 3 equals 24.

Now that we know the area to be covered is 24 sq ft, we can find the total number of tiles needed. Since each square foot requires 24 tiles, we multiply 24 sq ft by 24 tiles per sq ft.

24 * 24 = 576

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people and subtract it from the total number of slices.

First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Next, we find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since each of them ate 9 slices (3/4 * 12 = 9), the total number of slices eaten by these two friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people to find the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

The total number of slices is 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, this is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the total number of slices eaten by the 5 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in this group, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas to find the total number of slices eaten:

40 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices

The total number of slices is 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume in 30 days. This can be found by multiplying the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days: 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces.

Next, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find the number of packs needed: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 / 3 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8 
= 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of books each person has. We know Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can determine Steven's book count by dividing Clara's book count by 2.

Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find Alice's book count, we add 6 to Steven's book count.

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's book count from Clara's book count.

Difference in books = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference in books = 20 - 16
Difference in books = 4

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to determine the total number of students who like to play video games or music. 

Given that there are 50 students in total, and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. 

The number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. 
Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) 
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first need to find the total number of students required for 12 groups. 

Since the students are to be separated into groups of equal size, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the number of students per group.

Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we can find the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading her small stickers. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Next, we need to find out how many small stickers she has left. She had 30 small stickers initially and traded 27, so she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Now, let's calculate the number of large buttons she gets from trading her large stickers. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, we need to find out how many large stickers she has left. She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

Now, let's calculate the number of small buttons she gets from trading her large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has. She has 27 small buttons, 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the small buttons. Since she has 3 small stickers left, she still has 3 small buttons from the initial trade. So, the total number of small buttons is 27 + 60 - 3 = 84. The total number of buttons is 84 + 20 = 104.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

First, let's find the total time available: 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which sums up to 12 hours.

Next, we'll calculate the time spent reading, which is given as 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time spent playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining time. The remaining time is the total time available minus the time spent reading, which is 12 - 3 = 9 hours. Therefore, the time spent playing video games is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we'll divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the number of pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the remaining pencils after giving some to Brandon and Charlie.

First, Anthony gives 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This is equivalent to 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Next, he gives 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. This is equivalent to 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie. Now, we need to find 2/5 of the remaining 25 pencils, which is 25 * 2/5 = 10 pencils. This is the number of pencils Anthony kept.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The time it takes to drive to the museum is calculated as follows:
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time it takes to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Total time driving = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back home = 2 + 2 = 4 hours

The time Jack spends at the museum is given as 6 hours.

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time at the museum = 4 + 6 = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys and then subtract that from the initial number of wheels in the box.

First, let's find the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles. 

For the cars, we have 57 units, and each car requires 4 wheels. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, we have 73 units, and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

The initial number of wheels in the box is 650. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To find the final price after a discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 20% of the original price of $1000.

Discount amount = 20% of $1000
Discount amount = 0.20 * $1000
Discount amount = $200

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we calculate this as follows:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we calculate this as follows:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Next, we calculate the cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Then, we determine the cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{330}$"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's denote Emma's score as x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is 30(60 - (x + 4)) = 30(56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

The total score for Emma is x.

The total score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (1680 - 30x) = 2x + 1691 - 30x = -28x + 1691.

The difference in their scores is (-28x + 1691) - x = -29x + 1691.

However, we can simplify this expression by considering the given information. The difference in their scores is the sum of the differences in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (x + 4)) - 30(60 - x) = 30(-4) = -120.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 120 = -109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-109}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white fish Bob bought and the number of orange fish he bought. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can solve the first equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then use his car's fuel efficiency to find the amount of fuel consumed.

The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week using his car's fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

To find the total cost per week, we multiply the amount of fuel consumed by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and divide by 5: (10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of the twenties she spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to determine the portion of the total sales that are not smart TVs or analog TVs.

The portion of smart TVs is 1/4, and the portion of analog TVs is 1/8. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. 

1/4 can be rewritten as 2/8. 

Now we can add the portions: 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.

This means that 3/8 of the TVs are either smart or analog. To find the portion that is not smart or analog, we subtract 3/8 from 1 (the whole). 

1 - 3/8 can be rewritten as 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8.

Since 5/8 of the TVs are OLED, we can multiply this portion by the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs: 5/8 * 40 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to determine the total cost of the trip and the amount the school will cover. The trip costs $300, and the school will cover half of this amount.

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

Since the school will cover $150, we can find the amount John is missing by subtracting the amount he has from the amount the school will cover.

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total number of seashells, we need to determine the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

First, we find the number of groups:
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the daily earnings, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each cap:

10 bottle caps/day * $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Now, we need to calculate the total earnings for 30 days. We can do this by multiplying the daily earnings by the number of days:

$2.50/day * 30 days = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."

"To find the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at a 25% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

To find the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill, we subtract the price after the discount from the $50 bill:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month
220 employees * $4000 = $880,000 per month
240 employees * $4000 = $960,000 per month
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 + $1,040,000 = $3,680,000

However, the question asks for the total amount paid after three months, which is the sum of the salaries for the three months. The correct total is the sum of the salaries for the three months, not the sum of the salaries for all employees at the end of the three months. The correct total is:
$800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played.

First, let's find out how many hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. So, the total hours played in 2 weeks is 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. So, the total hours played in 1 week is 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Now, we add the hours played in 2 weeks and 1 week to find the total hours Kris has played: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then calculate the premium and add it to the total.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3, which equals $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can find the total number of chips.

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag
Total chips = 144 chips

Now, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips.

Total square inches = Total chips / chips per square inch
Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch
Total square inches = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height.

Length = Total square inches / height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
Length = 4 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students and then add it to the amount of tea left.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea drank to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 / 4 = 9.5 gallons.

The amount of tea left is given as 10 quarts. To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left. 

First, convert the amount of tea left to gallons: 10 / 4 = 2.5 gallons.

Now, add the amount of tea drank in gallons to the amount of tea left in gallons: 9.5 + 2.5 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to determine his total number of candies. Initially, he ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies. To find out how many candies he had left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies: 100 - 150 = -50. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. 

This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. He then ordered 100 more candies. So, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies: 100 + 100 = 200. 

Now, we subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

The initial number of students is 10. 

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the total number of marshmallows left after accounting for those used and dropped.

First, let's find the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag to find the number of marshmallows left. The bag initially had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine how many S'mores each kid can have. Therefore, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 
The two friends who are worse than Jack play for half the time, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 
The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500. 

The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent is $4500."
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes he needs and the number of cupcakes he already has.

The total number of cupcakes Paul needs is 63. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he already has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of cars Joe has, then calculate the number of cars he sells and gives away, and finally subtract that from the initial number of cars he had.

Since Robert has 20 cars and Joe has twice as many, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the amount each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to determine the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. 

John performs 30 cycles of work per day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks. Each task pays $1.20. 

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha struggled and scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, we can find Julie's score by subtracting 4 from Sasha's score in the first game: 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

Now, we can find Sasha's score in the second game by subtracting 6 from Julie's score in the first game: 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of green eggs: 5.

Since Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, we can calculate the number of blue eggs by multiplying the number of green eggs by 2: 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, we know Cindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so we subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs: 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Finally, we're told Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find the number of yellow eggs, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to consider both the weight and distance of the book. The cost per pound is $0.35, and the weight of the book is 4 pounds. The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping based on the weight:
Weight-based cost: 0.35 * 4 = $1.40

Next, let's calculate the cost of shipping based on the distance:
Distance-based cost: 0.08 * 20 = $1.60

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total cost of shipping:
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

To find the total amount Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price and add the shipping cost:
Total loss: $32 - $24 + $2.99 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had after her father gave her $100. She initially had $40, so adding $100 to that gives us $140.

Next, we need to find the total amount of money she spent on the items she purchased. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which is a total of 2 * $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

- Writing amateur songs: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
- Recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 120 minutes + 90 minutes + 72 minutes = 282 minutes

To convert the total weekly time to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the problem into its components.

First, let's consider the initial installation, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00.

Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to calculate the cost of these additional items.

For the mirrors, she has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, which will cost 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
For the chandeliers, she has 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, which will cost 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
For the pictures, she has 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures, which will cost 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of the additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the initial installation to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to determine the amount he has saved in relation to his brother Anthony and sister Eva.

Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings. To do this, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to establish a hierarchy of lifting abilities based on the given information.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey and then sum them together.

The distance covered in the first segment is calculated by multiplying the speed (8 miles per hour) by the time (4 hours): 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles.

Similarly, the distance covered in the second segment is calculated by multiplying the speed (8 miles per hour) by the time (6 hours): 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in both segments: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the time for one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos: 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. To find the time it takes for the turtles to travel across the highway, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2, since the turtles are moving at half the speed. However, we also need to account for the fact that there are four turtles, not one. Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can simply multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4 (the number of turtles), or we can multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 8 (2 * 4). 

So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 6 hours * 8 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each person made.

Let's start with Kora, who made 20 dishes. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Now, we know that Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. To find the number of dishes Jada made, we multiply the number of dishes Rory made by 2: 2 * 40 = 80.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: 
$400 + $50 = $450

Since Erika received $230, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is: 
$450 - $230 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large and small apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, we'll find the number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large and small apples together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is: 30 - 15 = 15

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we first need to establish the milk production rate per cow. Given that each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the required number of cows by dividing the desired daily milk production by the milk production rate per cow.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the required number of cows and the number of cows he already has.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

First, let's find the unused portion of the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left. To do this, we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/6.

12 * 1/6 = 2 millimeters

Next, we find the unused portion of the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left. We multiply 12 millimeters by 2/3.

12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters

Then, we find the unused portion of the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left. We multiply 12 millimeters by 1/2.

12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the car and the phone: $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Gabriel has a total of $5000 from working on weekends and an additional $200 from his brother, which amounts to $5200.

Now, we subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To find the change, we need to calculate the difference between the amount Thea gave the craftsman and the cost of the hat. 

The craftsman received four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 * $20 = $80.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of socks and dishes each person has. 

Let's start with Jack. We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can determine the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2. 

Jack's socks = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, we can calculate the number of socks Peter has by multiplying Jack's socks by 2.

Peter's socks = 30 * 2 = 60

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. To find the number of dishes Peter has, we can divide Jack's dishes by 2.

Peter's dishes = 60 / 2 = 30

Now that we have the number of socks and dishes for both Jack and Peter, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the distribution of their skills.

Let's denote the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B. We are given that M + E - B = 20 (since the students good at both are counted twice in the sum of M and E).

We are also given that M = 5 and E = 8. To find B, we can rearrange the equation to B = M + E - 20.

B = 5 + 8 - 20
B = 13 - 20
B = -7

However, the number of students cannot be negative, so this is an error in the given information. We will assume that the students good at both subjects are actually 7, as the problem states that the rest are good at both math and English.

B = 7

Now, to find the number of students good at math, we add the students good at math only to the students good at both math and English.

M = 5 + 7
M = 12

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

"To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we need to subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X. The number of goats sold from Farm X is given as 10, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Next, we need to find the number of goats sold from Farm Y. It's mentioned that the number of goats sold from Farm Y is twice the number of goats sold from Farm X. Since 10 goats were sold from Farm X, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we can find the number of goats left in Farm Y by subtracting the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y. The initial number of goats in Farm Y is 45, so the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y. Therefore, the total number of goats left is 45 + 25 = 70.

"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of this number is calculated as follows:

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

"To solve this problem, let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation.

Since x = 8.75, we can try x = 8 or x = 9.

If x = 8, then my brother's age is 8 + 3 = 11, my sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(11) - 1 = 32.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 - 1 = 56, which is less than 87.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 - 1 = 62, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 10. If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 - 1 = 68, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 11. If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 - 1 = 74, which is still less than 87.

The sum of our ages is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 - 1 = 92, which is greater than 87.

Since x = 14 results in a sum greater than 87, we can conclude that x must be less than 14.

Let's try x = 13. If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 - 1 = 56, which is less than 87.

Since x = 8 results in a sum less than 87, we can conclude that x must be greater than 8.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his students.

The total number of students in Mr. Jackson's class is 27, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. Therefore, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find the minimum number of packs needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we must round up to the nearest whole number. This is because he cannot purchase a fraction of a pack. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure every student has 2 glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"To find the total number of people infected after three days, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of people infected each day is 6 times the number of people infected the previous day, plus the number of people infected the previous day.

Day 1: 
- Let's denote the number of people infected on Day 1 as P1. P1 = 10 (initially infected) + 6 * 10 (new infections) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The number of people infected on Day 2 (P2) is 6 times the number of people infected on Day 1 (P1) plus the number of people infected on Day 1 (P1). P2 = 6 * P1 + P1 = 6 * 70 + 70 = 490.

Day 3: 
- The number of people infected on Day 3 (P3) is 6 times the number of people infected on Day 2 (P2) plus the number of people infected on Day 2 (P2). P3 = 6 * P2 + P2 = 6 * 490 + 490 = 3070.

"To find the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to determine the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. So, her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which means she received 90% of Rafaela's total tips. To find 90% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.9, resulting in 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is the sum of their individual tips, which is $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only boy 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges earned by each person in a 1-year time frame.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges in a year.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so she earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, Amber earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 1 = 3 badges per month. In a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices Paige baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, we find the total number of slices baked. Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she baked for 5 hours, the total number of loaves is 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Now, we need to convert the price per slice to dollars. Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we divide by 100 to get the price in dollars: 50 / 100 = 0.5 dollars per slice.

To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the problem states she sold all the slices. Since she baked 10 loaves and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, she actually baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices. This is the same as the previous calculation, but we can verify that she indeed sold all the slices.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

First, let's find the total number of burritos eaten by the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Next, we need to add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Now, we can find the number of leftover burritos by subtracting the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered. The total number of burritos ordered was 600.

So, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to determine the number of green and blue cars first.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes first. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's party, we first need to calculate the total number of Jello cups required. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello are required. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box. The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine his monthly expenditure. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.4.

$400 * 0.4 = $160

This is the amount Keenan spends in a month. To find out how much he spends per week, we divide this amount by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find the total number of pizza pieces eaten by Tobias, we need to calculate the pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to determine the cost of each item first.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

$0.03 * 16 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after purchasing the bolts.

"To find the cost price of the chickens, we first need to determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he will sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can find the cost price by subtracting the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine the number of glasses Micah sold. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Total glasses sold = 32

"To find out when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to first determine her current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, let's denote the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age as 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

Solving for x, we get x = 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final answer is: $-91"
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to consider the total runtime of the final concert, which includes the encore. The total runtime is given as 65 minutes, and it consists of the concert itself and a 15-minute encore.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore to this, we get the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we need to consider the total number of microphones and the percentage that won't fit.

Let's denote the total number of microphones as M and the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs as P. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2P.

We are given that 20% of the microphones won't fit, which means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. This can be represented as 0.8M = 2P.

Given that M = 50, we can substitute this value into the equation: 0.8 * 50 = 2P
40 = 2P
P = 40 / 2
P = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the number of cookies in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani had after eating some. 

Total cookies initially = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into five jars, we can find the number of cookies per jar by dividing the total cookies left by the number of jars.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, we can express this as a ratio:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find the cost of one carrot, let's analyze the given information. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means the yogurt costs $3.

We know that the total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. We can represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Therefore, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's hourly wage was initially $10, but it was increased by $2. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which means he works a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to determine the total amount she made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from the total amount she made.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

"To calculate John's profit from renting his car, we need to determine his total earnings and then subtract his car payment.

First, we calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours per rental and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Car payment: $500
Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the initial number of notebooks Martha had. Since she bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7, we can find her initial number of notebooks by subtracting the number of notebooks she bought from the total.

Martha's initial number of notebooks = Total number of notebooks - Number of notebooks bought
= 7 - 5
= 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can multiply Martha's initial number of notebooks by 3.

Joseph's number of notebooks = 3 * Martha's initial number of notebooks
= 3 * 2
= 6

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has.

Difference in the number of notebooks = Martha's number of notebooks - Joseph's number of notebooks
= 7 - 6
= 1

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, we can find the material per mask by dividing the total material used by the number of masks made. 
- Material per small mask = 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask

Now, we can find the total material needed for 20 small masks by multiplying the material per mask by the number of masks.
- Material needed for 20 small masks = 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards

For large masks, we can find the material per mask by dividing the total material used by the number of masks made.
- Material per large mask = 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask

Now, we can find the total material needed for 8 large masks by multiplying the material per mask by the number of masks.
- Material needed for 8 large masks = 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks together.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
This translates to: (60 - 8) = 2x
Simplifying the equation, we get: 52 = 2x
Dividing both sides by 2, we find: x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs by multiplying the number of cats by 3: 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we find the number of rabbits by subtracting 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The number of fish in the tank is three times the number of rabbits, so we multiply the number of rabbits by 3: 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

To find the number of gerbils, we divide the number of fish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, each row will have 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Let's denote the number of mint tea cups in each row as 'x'. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups in each row will also be 'x'. 

The total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea in each row is 2x. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 3 * 2x = 6x.

Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. The total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27, so the number of cups used for cinnamon tea is 27 - 6x. We know that this number is equal to 15.

Now, we can set up the equation 27 - 6x = 15. Solving for x, we get:

27 - 6x = 15
-6x = -12
x = 2

However, this is the number of cups of mint tea in each row, but we need to consider the fact that the number of cups of mint tea in each row must be a whole number. Since 2 is not a whole number, we need to re-examine the equation.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he needs to collect per trip to reach a total of 24 berries in 2 trips. 

To do this, we divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2), which gives us 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday.

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Now, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, which is 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

There are 5 days in total. 

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is calculated by dividing the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 378 / 5 = 75.6.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 75.6."
"To determine the distance each vehicle traveled, we multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, covered a distance of 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car, traveling at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, covered a distance of 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to determine the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys after the purchase.

The total number of toys before buying bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of blocks = 31
Number of stuffed animals = 8
Number of stacking rings = 9

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Now, we know that the total number of toys after buying bouncy balls is 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys before buying bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

"To find Peter's age, we need to establish a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables needed, we first calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available. 

The charity group receives 10 donations of 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
Adding the 10 boxes they already have, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, the number of tables required is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find the number of additional tables needed, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 more tables for the yard sale.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat is the sum of Zoey's and Sydney's total distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is the sum of the seeds spat by Zoey and Sydney: 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is calculated by dividing the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to break down the time he spends at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron chooses to pay for the additional hours after the 12-hour mark at a rate of 70 pesos per hour.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, we can calculate the cost of the additional hours as 70 * 5 = 350 pesos. This is because he stays 5 hours beyond the 12-hour mark.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of Cameron's stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find the cost of the 24-hour option, we simply take the given rate of 1600 pesos.

To determine how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs by finding twice the amount each goat needs and then subtracting 3 pounds.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas and the cost of the pencils from his earnings. The cost of gas is 50 dollars, and the cost of 5 pencils at 10 dollars each is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Total expenses: 50 dollars (gas) + 50 dollars (pencils) = 100 dollars
Remaining money: 300 dollars - 100 dollars = 200 dollars

Now, we can determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of each pen: 200 dollars / 25 dollars = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of positions available for the children. Since there are 8 children in each row and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 schools, we can multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then by the number of schools.

Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5
Total number of children = 280

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles she received.

First, we find the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher received. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she got is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To calculate the total amount Patty charged, we need to break down the costs involved.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply this by the hourly rate of $35. 

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Cost of parts = $60

Lastly, we add the visit fee, which is $40.

Visit fee = $40

Now, we can find the total cost by adding these three amounts together.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find the total amount James spent on the CDs, we first calculate the original price and then subtract the discount.

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of:
5 * $40 = $200

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent:
$90 - $200 = -$110

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that James actually made a profit. To find the correct answer, we take the absolute value of the result:
|- $110| = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To calculate the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to find the earnings from each type of crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams: 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20.

Then, we'll calculate the earnings from the carrots: 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time it took James to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do this, we need to find 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to consider the stickers she received and the stickers she lost.

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left after losing some, we subtract the number of stickers lost from the initial number of stickers: 15 - 7 = 8.

After losing some stickers, Jasmine received 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers she has at the end, we add the stickers she received for helping her classmates to the number of stickers she had left: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we need to determine the relationship between the three individuals. We know Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. 

First, we calculate Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age: 26 - 5 = 21.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age: 21 * 2 = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the number of points Azibo scored, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. This gives us two equations:

B = A + 20
B = D + 10

Since we have two equations with two variables, we can solve for A and D. We can start by substituting B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45.

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45.

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45.

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45.

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10.

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20.

This simplifies to B = D + 10. We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20.

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10. Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10. This simplifies to A = A.

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45.

This simplifies to 3D - 20 + 20 = 45. This simplifies to 3D = 45.

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10.

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider that each page is printed on both sides. Given that there are 100 pages to the inch, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch by doubling this value, resulting in 200 pages per inch.

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book to find the total number of pages. 

200 pages per inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Her sleepwalking episode occurred from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 * 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. 

Next, we need to find the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we can calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks by multiplying 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks):

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks:

200 + 700 = 900

Finally, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 16 emails a day and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we calculate the number of emails to family, which is two-thirds of the non-work emails. This is given by (2/3) * 9 = 6.

Now, we need to find the number of emails to her boyfriend, which is one-third of the remaining non-work emails. The remaining non-work emails are 9 - 6 = 3. Therefore, the number of emails to her boyfriend is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to determine Shawna's age first. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Aliya's age = 3 years
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

20% of 48 can be calculated as 0.20 * 48 = 9.6.

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

The actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice, we need to determine the number of balls carried by each of the three boys and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 4x balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. This allows us to set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the number of balls carried by each of the boys:

- Jeffrey carried x = 1 ball
- Jason carried 2x = 2 balls
- Jordan carried 4x = 4 balls

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then use that information to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

Let's start by calculating the total number of holes at the end of the first day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Now, we can find the number of holes dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to determine the number of corn chips each person received and then sum them up.

Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Now we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 10 hours: speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the last 5 hours: speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Then, we calculate the distance traveled in the 2 hours: speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. She also received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Next, let's calculate the number of brownies eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, we can find the total number of brownies left over by subtracting the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"

"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the remaining 2 phones.

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining 2 phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all 4 phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to determine the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20 (Zeke's team)

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To determine the total number of wooden slats needed for the fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away. She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. The total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges to find the number of oranges she had left: 240 - 80 = 160.

Since Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, we need to find 1/4 of 160. To do this, we multiply 160 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4: 160 / 4 = 40.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left: 160 - 40 = 120.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to determine the number of states in each country.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. To find half of 50, we divide 50 by 2, which equals 25. Then, we add 4 to 25, resulting in 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India to find the total: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries each person has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard.

Let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can set up the equation: Richard's cherries + 10 = Robert's cherries. We know Robert has 30 cherries, so Richard's cherries + 10 = 30. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us Richard's cherries = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total earnings for the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days.

Let's start by determining the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 10 + 5 = 15.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since we know the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, which is given as 15. Therefore, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her 8-day vacation.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. Therefore, she will use a total of 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Now, we need to find out how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen she will need. To do this, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is given as $100. To find 40% of this price, we multiply it by 0.4 (since 40% is equivalent to 0.4 as a decimal).

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, we subtract this discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

The price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the blue and red cars together.

Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. 

From the information given, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This can be expressed as (E + 5) = 0.5D, where 5 represents the 5 years that will pass before Emil turns 24.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This can be expressed as (E + 5) = 2B.

We can use the first equation to express D in terms of E: D = 2(E + 5).

Now, we can substitute this expression for D into the second equation: (E + 5) = 2B. We can also substitute D = 2(E + 5) into the first equation: E + 5 = 0.5(2(E + 5)).

Simplifying the equation, we get E + 5 = E + 5. This equation is true for all values of E, so we need to use the second equation to find the value of E. We can rewrite the second equation as E + 5 = 2B.

We are given that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 12 years old. This means that B = 12 - 5 = 7 (since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24). 

Now that we know B, we can find E: E + 5 = 2B, so E + 5 = 2(7), which simplifies to E + 5 = 14. Solving for E, we get E = 9.

Now that we know E, we can find D: D = 2(E + 5) = 2(9 + 5) = 2(14) = 28.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is D + B = 28 + 7 = 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads. 
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. 
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to determine the number of football players. 20% of the class are football players, and since there are 30 students in the class, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Since these students are part of the remaining class after removing the football players, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:

30 - 6 = 24 students.

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining 24 students to determine the number of cheerleaders or band members:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to add their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. 
Charlie's shoe size is 5 times Sophie's, so it is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30.
The average shoe size is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we also need to account for the width of the plant itself (12 inches). The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

However, we need to consider that Pat already owns 17 flowers. Therefore, she needs to buy 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate this as follows:

1/2 * 18 = 9

Now, we need to find the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

9 * 7 = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

Next, we'll find the cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The 4 sunflowers require 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
The 10 carnations require 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil in total, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we then multiply this amount by the number of months in a year, which is 12. This gives us $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes, which is $1,000.00, to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to cook 90 shrimp is 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet and then calculate Bill's age at that time.

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between Bill's father seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years.

We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This can be expressed as 3x. 

Since the time elapsed between the two events is 75 years, we can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75, which simplifies to 2x = 75.

Solving for x, we get x = 75 / 2 = 37.5. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can assume that Bill's father was 37 years old when he saw the comet.

Now, we need to find Bill's age when his father was 37 years old. We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, which is 3 * 37 = 111 years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between Bill's father seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years. Therefore, Bill was 111 - 75 = 36 years old when his father was 37 years old.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill was 36 years old.

So, Bill was 36 - 75 = -39 years old when his father saw the comet. However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This can be expressed as 3x.

Since the time elapsed between the two events is 75 years, we can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75, which simplifies to 2x = 75.

Solving for x, we get x = 75 / 2 = 37.5. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can assume that Bill's father was 37 years old when he saw the comet.

Now, we need to find Bill's age when his father was 37 years old. We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, which is 3 * 37 = 111 years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between Bill's father seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years. Therefore, Bill was 111 - 75 = 36 years old when his father was 37 years old.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill's father saw the comet 75 years before Bill was 36 years old.

So, Bill was 36 - 75 = -39 years old when his father saw the comet. However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This can be expressed as 3x. 

Since the time elapsed between the two events is 75 years, we can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75, which simplifies to 2x = 75.

Solving for x, we get x = 75 / 2 = 37.5. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can assume that Bill's father was 37 years old when he saw the comet.

Now, we need to find Bill's age when his father was 37 years old. We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's consider the checks for the electric and gas bills. Since Buford writes a check for each of these bills every month, the total number of checks for these bills is 12 (months) * 2 (bills) = 24 checks per year.

Next, we'll consider the checks to the church. Buford writes 2 checks to the church every month, so the total number of checks to the church per year is 12 (months) * 2 (checks) = 24 checks.

Now, let's consider the checks to the pest and lawn service. Since Buford writes a check to this service every 3 months, the total number of checks per year is 12 (months) / 3 (months per check) = 4 checks.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we add the number of checks for each category: 24 (electric and gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can set up the equation x / 2 = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 88.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we can start by expressing the total age of the children as an equation. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

However, the lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by Walter's friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the number of people in the church, we first need to determine the total number of cookies given to the church. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. 

Let's say each kid gets x units of watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 5:00 pm to minutes: 5:00 pm = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Now, subtract the total time required from the desired serving time in minutes:
300 - 180 = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes back to hours and minutes, we divide by 60:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake at 3:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of students per session.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

To find the total earnings per month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box

"To find the number of female porcupines, we first need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 of 50 = (3 * 50) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the product of its width, length, and depth. Given that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can proceed as follows:

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to determine the gallons of water needed, we perform this calculation:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

We are given that there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, we find the number of yellow sticks, which is 3 less than the blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can find the number of male students over 16 by dividing 1500 by 4, resulting in 375 male students over 16.

The remaining students are under 16, which is also half of the total students, so there are 1500 students under 16. Since one-half of these students are male, we can find the number of male students under 16 by dividing 1500 by 2, resulting in 750 male students under 16.

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16, which is 1500 - 375 = 1125. Similarly, we can find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16, which is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which is 1125 + 750 = 1875.

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, let's start with Bethany, who can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Next, Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Then, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Finally, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21.1% = 33.9%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 33.9% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 33.9% - 28% = 5.9%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 5.9%.

Solving for y, we get y = 33.9%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 33.9%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 33.9% = 21.1%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21.1% = 33.9%.

Solving for x, we get x = 55.0%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs given away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 0.3 packs. To do this, we multiply 0.3 by 60: 0.3 * 60 = 18.

Now, we add the pieces in 1 pack (60) to the pieces in 0.3 packs (18) to find the total number of pieces each friend received: 60 + 18 = 78.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

The original price of carrots is $120. The price increases by 5% every year. 

Year 1: 
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first determine the number of pictures in each album. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were dedicated to selfies only. To find the total number of selfies, we multiply the number of selfies albums by the number of pictures per album.

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

The remaining albums are portraits, which is a total of 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The family consists of three members: the man, his wife, and their son. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

To find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day, we add the number of sandwiches each family member eats: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the number of days in a week: 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we need to calculate her total income from selling cookies and cupcakes, then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies:
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of:
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and subtract the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.

There are 10 eggs remaining unfound.

Now, we can find the number of eggs found by the friends by subtracting the total eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the amount of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the daily ore production and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, let's determine the daily ore production of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. 

Now, to find the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe, we need to calculate 50% more than the iron pickaxe production. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Next, we multiply the daily ore production of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves = 1440 pounds/day.

Finally, we multiply the daily ore production of 40 dwarves by the number of days in a month (30 days) to find the total ore production in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price ratio between the first two packages. The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.

We can simplify the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4, which simplifies to 3/2.

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5.

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the interest rate as a decimal and multiply it by the amount still owed.

The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and Tom pays $1000 from selling his old bedroom set. 

Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

The interest rate is 10% per month, which as a decimal is 0.10. 

Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

First, let's consider the red balloons. 40% of them burst, so the number of red balloons remaining is 60% of the original 25. 
60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Next, we consider the yellow balloons. Half of them were released, so the number of yellow balloons remaining is 50% of the original 12.
50% of 12 = 0.5 * 12 = 6

Now, let's add the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6

Now, we add up the remaining balloons: 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue.
Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to determine the number of available seats in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question implies that the remaining tickets are for guests. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

Let's start by considering the large jelly beans. We know that 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

Now, we need to find the equivalent number of small beans. We are given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion: 3x = 150, where x is the number of small beans.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small jelly beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

First, let's find her total earnings: 
Total earnings = 3 days * $15 per day = $45

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses: 
Total expenses = 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find the total number of hours she worked: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses: 
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount spent is 66 dollars.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes, and each box contains 40 apples, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then divide that by his new income.

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which equals 85. Then, we add 17 to this result, giving us 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. Adding 5 to this result gives us 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken salad: 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pasta salad: 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the two costs together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's start by calculating the amount lost in each race. 

1. In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

The final answer is: $9.17"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities. 

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is 26 * 5 = 130.

Since each city has a population of 1000 people, the total population of South America is 130 * 1000 = 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height can be converted from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Then, we add the 3 inches he grew over the summer: 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's height is given as 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the first person's share as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's find the total number of days in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is given by: 
P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t
where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the time in years.

Given that the initial price of the car is $20,000 and the depreciation rate is 21% per year, we can calculate the price in 2010 as follows:

P(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= 20000 * (0.79)^3
= 20000 * 0.4914
= 9828.00

The final answer is: $9828"
"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we first need to determine the total number of books written in English and German.

Half of the books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.
10% of the books are written in German, which is 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30 books.
Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

"To determine the amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she consumes in that time frame. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Initially, we start with 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The tank top costs $10.
- The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
- The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
- The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

The area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt. 

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover this area. To do this, we divide the total area by the area of a single tile: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of James' insurance, we first need to calculate 60% of the normal cost. This can be done by multiplying the normal cost by 0.6.

Normal cost: $120
Increased cost = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add the increased cost to the normal cost to get the total cost.

Total cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to get the annual cost.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, so they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

In one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we need to determine the number of slices each of them ate.

Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 
10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses into their individual components.

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200.

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The patient also needs to purchase 30 painkillers at a cost of $4 per pill. So, the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, there is the cost of parking, which is a minimum of 2 hours at $6 per hour. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

"To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to determine the number of emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

The number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

However, the initial calculation was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the correct total:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The correct total is actually 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 0.7 by 20, which equals 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons, which is twice the number of small coupons. Number of small coupons: 700, so the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the total cost of small coupons and big coupons to find the total cost of postage: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each of these sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark then ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. 

Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Now, we need to find the total number of meatballs in these 6 sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that reached the farmers by subtracting the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now we know that the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. Since 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks, we can find the total by multiplying the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

To find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number saved per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie bowled a score of 90, so twice that is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score. This is a simple arithmetic operation: 180 + 15 = 195.

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

"To determine the total time James spent walking, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the total distance is twice the distance to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas in both scenarios.

First, let's find the total number of bananas Jenny purchased: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

This means Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the production and collection rates of the farmer and the truck driver.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck driver collects 3 bales per hour. Given that they both work for 6 hours, we can calculate the total production and collection as follows:

Total production = 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales
Total collection = 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the total collection from the total production: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the total minutes John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes for the regular classes and the extra classes, then add the minutes for the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes for the regular classes: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

Next, let's find the total minutes for the extra classes: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1/16 of the total minutes per week is spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total minutes per week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

Next, we find the height of the second child, which is two inches taller than the first child. So, the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

Then, we calculate the height of the third child, which is 5 inches shorter than the second child. Therefore, the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, we determine the height of the fourth child, which is three inches taller than the third child. Thus, the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as 'x'. 

When the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, it left the other half, which is x/2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of this remaining half, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4. We know that the velociraptors had 270 kilograms, so x/4 = 270.

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 4, resulting in x = 270 * 4 = 1080. However, this is the weight the T-Rex ate, not the original weight of the triceratops.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops is twice the weight the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 3 shaken and 9 unshaken. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, resulting in 3 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 8 sodas in total, with 2 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 1 / 4
Probability = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = 0.25 * 100
Probability = 25%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and add them together.

Let's start by finding the speed of the second train, which is half the speed of the first train. Since the first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, the second train's speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours. The first train's distance is 60 * 3 = 180 miles, and the second train's distance is 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to determine the number of days he is available to help. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine the age of his sister, Martha. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate her age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find the miles run by Ahito, we first need to determine the miles run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels. They were on sale for 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to find the total cost of the new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the initial charge minus the returned item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00. Then, we add the total cost of the new purchases: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to save. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Given that she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of 20% of her annual salary, which is $20,000 per year:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

The distance of a one-way trip can be calculated using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents, the one-way distance is:

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

However, John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance driven in a month, we multiply the total distance of a round trip by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To find the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine the total distance Sofie will walk in that time frame. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate this by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Now, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. To find Brian's distance, we can divide Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we first need to determine the total number of toys produced by the four workers in 10 hours. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
Two other workers produce 4 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
The combined production rate of these four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 
In 10 hours, they produce a total of 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys in 10 hours. 
To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find one-fourth of 60, we divide 60 by 4, resulting in 15 pounds for Elijah's first dog.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find half of 60, we divide 60 by 2, resulting in 30 pounds for Elijah's second dog.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the initial number of stickers Seth had, we can work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. This means Luis had 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Since Luis had 14 stickers, which is half of what Seth had, we can find the initial number of stickers Seth had by multiplying 14 by 2.

Therefore, Seth initially had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. 

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Next, we calculate the total number of M&M's: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car first. Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to establish the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice that of Vince's, we can express this as an equation: 2x = 14, where 14 is Liam's age two years ago.

Solving for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 14 / 2 = 7. This represents Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

We also know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how much John makes from cutting down the tree, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price per plank.

First, we find 80% of the 80-foot tree to determine the usable length.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide the usable length by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then sum them up.

Valerie's salary is given as $5000 per month. Since her brother earns half of what she earns, his salary is $5000 / 2 = $2500 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $2500 = $7500 per month.

Now, their mother's salary is twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $7500 = $15,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $2500 + $15,000 = $20,000 + $20,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's assume the speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. 

The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40. 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. Since she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, the total amount saved is:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Next, we find the remaining amount she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find the number of additional weeks:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, Jane needs 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the average temperature of the two mugs after pouring the water into the bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. When 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle are poured into the bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it must be a positive value. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Now, we can find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the total number of cows and chickens.

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount. 

The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00, and there are 4 packs. 
Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Now, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost to get the discounted cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Next, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine the number of scoops that is 5 less than 23. This is simply 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, we calculate 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops.

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. To find out how many scoops 18 scoops is in terms of 2 scoops, we divide 18 by 2, which equals 9. 

Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, 9 sets of 2 scoops will require 9 * 3 = 27 potatoes.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers separately.

First, let's find the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day, we can multiply the number of bouquets by the number of sunflowers per bouquet.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find the number of sunflowers sold from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide the daily earnings by the cost per sunflower.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

"To find the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100 investment. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Now, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find the amount of money Adam loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each person collected and then divide the total number of seashells equally among them.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2R.

We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. Therefore, the number of seashells Jim collected is 2R + 5.

We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells. So, we can write the equation: 2R + 5 = 27.

Solving for R, we get:
2R = 22
R = 11

Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected:
Carlos collected 2R = 2(11) = 22 seashells

We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells.

The total number of seashells collected is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned. 
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate its length by dividing Carl's height by 2.
Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7300}$"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since they are octuplets).

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2
Number of babies wearing blue and bows: 2

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 + 2 = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's start by calculating the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 4043

Now, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, let's calculate the amount of land sold in the first two transactions. Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. This means he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's find the remaining land. The total land sold so far is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. Subtracting this from the total land, we get 80 - 60 = 20 square meters remaining.

The remaining land is sold for $3 per square meter. Therefore, the amount of money earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to determine half of Haley's age first. Since Haley is 26 years old, we calculate this as 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we need to find Geb's age, which is 10 less than half of Haley's age. This can be calculated as 13 - 10 = 3.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, let's determine the number of eggs found by each person:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to determine the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

Let's start by calculating the production of each year:

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, and a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits (20 * 50 = 1000 fruits), the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"To find the amount of money Jack has now, we need to determine 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is calculated as $100 divided by 5, which equals $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final numerical answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the initial amounts of money Ronnie and Rissa had. Let's assume Ronnie had $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, Rissa had 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the amount of red paint used in the mural, we need to consider the total amount of paint used and the proportions of each color.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the other half of the mural, which is 6 pints, is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of the bedrooms. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. It's given that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, let's consider the rest of the house. We're told that the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can use a geometric sequence to model the situation. The number of clouds each day forms a sequence: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

This is a geometric sequence with a first term of 3 and a common ratio of 2. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

We want to find the sum of the first 5 terms of this sequence. The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is:

Sn = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values, we get:

a1 = 3
r = 2
n = 5

Sn = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
Sn = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
Sn = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
Sn = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we calculate the additional pods as 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. The number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

Since the question asks for the number of 5 dollar bills, we need to find the number of bills, not the total amount of money. The number of 5 dollar bills is equal to the number of bills after tripling, which is 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

Let's start by determining the number of goals scored by team B in the first half. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, and team A scores 4 goals in the first half, team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Therefore, team B scores a total of 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Now, let's find the number of goals scored by team A in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the number of face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine the number of face masks Mike bought. Since we know that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we can represent the number of face masks Mike bought as 'x'. 

The number of face masks Johnny bought can then be represented as 3x + 2.

Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can substitute x with 5 in the equation 3x + 2 to find the number of face masks Johnny bought.

3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then divide it by the total number of James' teeth.

The dentist drills 4 teeth. He also caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

Now, we need to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist fixes (15) by the total number of James' teeth (30), and then multiply by 100 to convert the result to a percentage.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."
"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

Now, we need to find the total refund. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, we multiply the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.

Next, he put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 6 apples in his pocket (1 from the initial 2 and 5 new apples).

Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. This gives him a total of 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

"To determine the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rates at which he builds and melts snowballs.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, which translates to a rate of 1/3 snowballs per minute. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, resulting in a melting rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we rewrite 1/3 as (5/15). Now, we can subtract: (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to first determine Jim's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now and was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age 20 years ago.

Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can write the equation: x * 2 = 8 (John's age 20 years ago). 

Solving for 'x', we get x = 8 / 2 = 4. This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had after the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 28 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages they had after the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had after the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to consider her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's determine her total hours worked in April. Since she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked = 7.5 * 6 * 4
Total hours worked = 180 hours

Next, we can calculate her regular pay by multiplying her total hours worked by her hourly rate of $1.5:

Regular pay = Total hours worked * Hourly rate
Regular pay = 180 hours * $1.5
Regular pay = $270

In addition to her regular pay, Jen also receives an attendance bonus of $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days:

Attendance bonus = $10 * 24
Attendance bonus = $240

Now, we can find her total earnings by adding her regular pay and attendance bonus:

Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to determine the amount he earned from each task and then sum them up.

For laundry, Jason earned $3.00 for doing it once.
For cleaning his room, he earned $1.50 for doing it once.
For taking the trash out, he earned $0.75 for each of the two times he did it, which is $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
For emptying the dishwasher, he earned $0.50 for each of the six times he did it, which is $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the earnings:

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

We also know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the scotch. The total cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Now, let's consider the cognac. The number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the White Oak trees. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 trees. On the second day, he planted 10 more, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

Now, let's move on to the Lodgepole Pine trees. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we calculate one-third of the total number of fish.

One-third of 66 = 66 / 3 = 22

Next, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. To do this, we first find the number of fish that do not have red stripes.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed.

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the total pounds of meat needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now, we can find the total seasoning needed by multiplying the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to determine the number of pomelos she was left with after giving some away, which is 1/4 of the original amount.

Let's calculate 1/4 of the original 20 pomelos: 20 * (1/4) = 5.

This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the remaining amount from the original amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters, we can find 1 quarter by dividing 9 by 3.

9 / 3 = 3

Now, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

3 * 4 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance he traveled in 3 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can find the distance covered by multiplying his average speed by the total hours traveled.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

Next, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered. 

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, the correct answer is 60%."
"To find the initial number of grapes, let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, leaving x - 6 grapes.

Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. So, after her brother used the grapes, the remaining number of grapes is x - 6 - 30 = x - 36.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of grapes: x - 36 - 48 = 0, since the mother used all the remaining grapes.

Simplifying the equation, we get x - 84 = 0.

Adding 84 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 84.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to consider the number of teachers who were not sick and the number of substitute teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of teachers who were not sick. This can be found by subtracting the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers sick = 13

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find the total number of teachers at school.

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to determine the total time available for cleaning and the total time required to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, and they work 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total time available for cleaning is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

To convert the total time required to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is 2 bookcases.

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out her total required correct answers. 

The total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions. To pass, she must get 70% of these questions correct. 

70% of 110 questions is calculated as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she got 60% of the first test's 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test. 

To do this, we subtract the questions she got right on the first test from the total required: 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, so we can write this as S + B = 116.

Now, we can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total points she scored each year and then multiply that by the number of years.

First, we find the total points she scored each year by multiplying the number of games she played each year by her score per game. 

Number of games per year: 40
Score per game: 21 points

Total points per year = 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year

Now, we multiply the total points per year by the number of years to find the total points in four years.

Total points in 4 years = 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

Let's start by calculating the number of people Conor saw on the first three days. On the first day, he saw 50 people. On the second day, he saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade to be made. Since Tim wants to make 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, the total amount of lemonade is 5 gallons.

Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 5 cups.

Since the extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice as the regular lemonade, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This is 2 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade as follows:

2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Next, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the regular lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice and 4 gallons of regular lemonade are needed, we can calculate the number of lemons needed as follows:

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5/6 * 6 = 5 lemons

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Now, to find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to find the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel can be found by multiplying the cost of one night by the number of nights. 
Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Number of nights: 3
Total cost of the hotel: $80 * 3 = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. 
Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Cost of one bus trip: 10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8
Number of bus trips: 7
Total cost of the bus trips: $8 * 7 = $56

Now, we can find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels by adding the two costs together.
Total cost of the hotel and bus travels: $240 + $56 = $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. 

Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.

First, let's find the total weight by adding the individual weights together:

Weight of car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, we need to find 1% of the total weight, which is equivalent to 0.01 times the total weight.

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we subtract those from the total required:
Total hot dogs required: 40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes Nate to fill them in.

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, the dog also digs 6 new holes every night, so we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we'll assume the same duration for filling the holes.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. However, this statement is incorrect as it would imply that Igor gathered 16 test tubes, which contradicts the information that he gathered half as many test tubes as requested. Therefore, we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested, which means he gathered 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.

We are also given that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: B = 7.

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29. We can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get: 8 + 7 + 12 = 27.

However, we know that the total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, so he must have lost some items. Let's denote the number of lost beakers as L. Then, the total number of items Igor had is 27 + L.

We can set up the equation: 27 + L = 29.

Solving for L, we get: L = 29 - 27 = 2.

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Aaron runs for half the distance of Vanessa (4 miles), we can express this as 2A = 4, which simplifies to A = 2.

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed using the relationship A = 2V:
2 = 2V
V = 1

Since Vanessa's speed is 1 mile per minute, it takes her 4 minutes to run 4 miles.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first determine the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

Given that the profit percentage is 25%, the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

Let's denote the cost price of one watermelon as 'x'. The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write the equation as 50x = 80.

Now, let's solve for 'x':
50x = 80
x = 80 / 50
x = $1.60

Now that we know the cost price of one watermelon, we can find the selling price of one watermelon. The selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is 1.25 times the cost price. 

Selling price of one watermelon = 1.25 * $1.60
Selling price of one watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the current age of James, we need to find Dora's current age first. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we need to find John's current age. John had James when he was 19, so the time that has passed since then is 18 years. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, his age will be 5 + 3 = 8 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour, we need to calculate their individual rates of peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate of peeling oranges is 1/3 oranges per minute. In 60 minutes, she can peel 60 * (1/3) = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate of peeling oranges is 1/4 oranges per minute. In 60 minutes, she can peel 60 * (1/4) = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400. The discount is 80% off, so the discount amount is 400 * 0.8 = $320. Subtracting the discount from the original cost, we get 400 - 320 = $80 as the cost of the radiator after the discount.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). So, we calculate 56 / 4.

56 / 4 = 14

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices."
